## Healing Potions
If you use your action to drink a healing potion you get max healing, but if you use a bonus action you have to roll.

## Die Silently
All death saving throws must be hidden from the players.

## You’re Coming with Me
If you drop to 0 HP you get one reaction for a melee critical hit, but you start your death saving throws with 2 failures.

## Material Components
Material Components are not necessary for spells unless they are expensive or unique. Up to the DM’s discretion.

## True Critical Hit
When calculating damage for critical hits, you take the max number for your damage die plus the result of rolling your damage die once.

## Tired After Dying
After falling to 0 HP each failed death saving throw is a point of exhaustion.
