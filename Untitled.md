I am Dungeon Mastering Curse of Strahd. The campaign focuses on horror and mystery and has dark tones. I need a shop keeper who clearly has secrets. Please provide a physical description as well as a description of his personality.

Name: Thaddeus Grimm

Physical Description: Thaddeus Grimm is a gaunt figure, his skin pale and tight against his high cheekbones and sharp jawline. His eyes are a dark, shadowy grey that seem to absorb the room's light, making it difficult to discern any particular emotion. He stands at an above-average height, his posture slightly hunched as if carrying an unseen burden. A wild mass of white hair sits atop his head, falling over into a thick beard that conceals much of his expression.

His attire is meticulously clean despite its evident age and wear; a faded black robe with silver trimmings. No jewelry adorns him except for an intricate silver amulet that hangs around his neck – an enigmatic symbol etched into its surface. His hands are long and bony, fingers constantly twitching or fiddling with some unseen object.

Personality Description: Thaddeus is an enigmatic individual who exudes a quiet intensity that can be off-putting to those unaccustomed to his presence. He speaks in soft whispers, each word carefully chosen and pronounced as if it carries significant weight. Though he often gives off the impression of being deeply lost in thought or distracted by something only he can perceive, he has proven himself more than capable of managing his shop effectively.

Thaddeus is highly secretive and prefers to keep interactions professional and brief; however, he displays a surprising amount of knowledge about various artifacts or rare items that adventurers might bring into his shop – always willing to share tidbits about their history or use but never revealing how he came by such information. A keen observer might notice the faintest flicker of fear in his eyes when certain items are presented - as though they stir painful memories best forgotten.

Despite this air of mystery and foreboding about him, Thaddeus has proven himself reliable in the past - always delivering on his promises and never cheating his customers. He doesn't seem to be driven by greed or power, but rather by a relentless pursuit of knowledge - although what exactly he seeks remains a mystery. His secretive nature, vast knowledge, and the strange aura that surrounds him all hint at a past filled with dark secrets and forbidden lore.

He is not hostile, but he is certainly not friendly either - always polite but distant. His laughter is rare and feels oddly out of place in the otherwise gloomy atmosphere of his shop. But there is an undeniable sense of dread that hangs around
