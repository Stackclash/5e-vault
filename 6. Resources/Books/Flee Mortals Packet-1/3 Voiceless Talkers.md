# Voiceless Talkers
*Source: Flee, Mortals! (Packet 1), p. 10* 

Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (singular: synliroi) are known as the "voiceless talkers" to the denizens of the World Below—and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the "barking ones" (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) to be a corrupt branch of the evolutionary tree—an abomination that must be corrected.

## Uneasy Alliances

Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.

## Aboleth Hatred

The synlirii's visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) aboleths. Ancient myths say aboleths created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.

## Psionic Spies

Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their form, and pass undetected among other cultures.

## Psi-Tech

Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plasticlike substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers' handheld psi-pistols and portable psirifles can only be used by their alien minds.

## Creature Engineers

Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don't live long and aren't intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers' body banks—most of them singular life forms that can't reproduce and may never die.

> [!note] Psi-Tech
> 
> While most psi-tech weapons can only be used by voiceless talkers, a character using the talent class (from the upcoming MCDM supplement The Talent and Psionics) can use these weapons by gaining 1 strain each time they make an attack with it. A creature using a psi-tech ranged weapon uses Intelligence instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls.

## Hulking Brain

The voiceless talkers have engineered gray-skinned, humanoid-shaped aberrations with four massive arms and—in place of a head—a large pulsing brain. Called thylinça by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii masters.

## Mindkiller

Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers' pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid's body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim's central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim's knowledge and memories and can puppet the body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller's synlirii overlords.

Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller that can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can't inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes' mental defenses against psionics.

## Lord Syuul

Chief Design Architect of his nation's body banks, the synliroi Lord Syuul seeks more material for his experiments. His spies, informants, and allies are always on the lookout for subjects with unique hereditary traits the Interlace might extract.

Lord Syuul, who belongs to an ancient and respected noble house, never leaves his estate without a retinue of guards and minions. They obey his orders fanatically—as Syuul has ensured they're biologically incapable of refusing.

Syuul's recent experiments have focused on isolating the trait that expresses sorcerous ability in humanoids. Thus far, these attempts have been unsuccessful. Not to be deterred, Lord Syuul has placed his assistant in charge of the day-to-day operations of the body banks, while Syuul himself ventures forth to observe the surface world and plunder its diversity.

## Stat Blocks

> Voiceless talkers are evil sapient beings who engage in reprehensible and irredeemable acts of eugenics. While you can create exceptional synlirii who fight against such philosophies and practices, the voiceless talkers who participate in genetic experiments are unquestionably evil.
