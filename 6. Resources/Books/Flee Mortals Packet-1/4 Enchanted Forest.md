Magic permeates nature. From fulminating thunderstorms to nurturing berries, nature answers when adventurers seek its verdant potency. Where planar veils are thin, ancient spirits dwell, or ley lines emanate wild energy, enchanted forests await with mesmerizing creatures and mysteries.

## Enchanted Forest Traits

You can create an enchanted forest version of an existing creature by taking their stat block and adding one or more of the following traits:

- **Speak with Beasts and Plants.** The enchanted forest creature can communicate with Beasts and Plants as if they share a language.  
- **Tree Stride.** Once per turn, the enchanted forest creature can use 10 feet of their movement to step magically into one living tree within reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be the same size category as the enchanted forest creature or bigger.  
- **Living Forest.** A writhing grove thrives in a 30-foot radius centered on the enchanted forest creature. Mist lightly obscures that area, and colorful vines and shifting foliage make its ground difficult terrain. Teasing voices laugh and whisper, giving other creatures in that area disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells and similar effects. Flickering lights extinguish magical darkness in that area created by spells of 3rd level or lower. (When adding this trait to a creature, you can choose to exclude one or more of these effects.)  

## Enchanted Forest Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in an enchanted forest by giving them the following lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the enchanted forest creature can take one of the following lair actions; the enchanted forest creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row.

- **Frothing Flora.** The enchanted forest creature causes roots and vines to temporarily grow around them; until initiative count 20 on the next round, the ground within 30 feet of the enchanted forest creature is difficult terrain.  
- **Writhing Roots.** Foliage in the enchanted forest creature's lair becomes a conduit for the enchanted forest creature's power. The enchanted forest creature can target creatures of their choice that are touching such plant life within 90 feet of the enchanted forest creature. A target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Wisdom saving throw or take PBd6 psychic damage and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#grappled\|grappled]] (escape DC 10 plus PB).  
- **Faerie Lights.** The enchanted forest creature creates dancing lights in a 20-foot cube at a point they can see within 120 feet of them. Each creature in that area who can see the lights must make a DC 10 plus PB Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]], outlined in light, and sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round. [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] rolls against an affected creature have advantage if the attacker can see them, and the affected creature can't benefit from being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible\|invisible]].  

## Dancing Lady

Strange visions in the mist are to be expected in enchanted forests, but in the case of the dancing lady, these figures aren't illusions—they're real ... sort of.

The dancing lady is an enormous plant with white humanoid-sized flowers resembling figures in dresses. Large red and green leaves surround these hanging blooms. The dancing lady lurks around fey populations or other forest denizens, flowers peacefully turning until a threat appears. Once the plant's allies are endangered, the dancing lady's oversized flowers spring into dizzying dances to addle and frighten foes.

## Empyrean Stag

As Celestial wardens of the forest, empyrean stags appear only to defend forest denizens from great threats or to warn mortals about forthcoming calamities. Their white fur is dappled with blue, and their eyes shine with the darkness of night.

### Unyielding Defenders

Adventurers often clash with forest denizens, from hungry owlbears to mischievous fey. This violence draws an empyrean stag's ire, often provoking a deadly attack from the stag and their forest allies. Repentant adventurers can make restitution by helping the stag defend the wood from an even greater threat.

### Divine Knowledge

Those who impress an empyrean stag—typically by protecting the forest—are allowed to ask the stag one question, which the Celestial answers truthfully to the best of their ability. Between their antlers, they can show shimmering visions of the present or glimpses of the future. The horns glow gold when the stag aids an ally, and white when they divine information.
