In a long-lost language, the word oruk—"blood fire"—described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one other as kanin in their own tongue, they also use "orc" with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk. Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They've settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics.

Though orcs are no more likely to stand in the adventurers' way than any other folk, those who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.

## Relentlessly Tough

Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they're excited or driven. Their hair, which can range from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.

Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with "blood fire," glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white respectively.

## Innate Power

The intense power of an orc's spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc conduits hone their magic into singular affinities that are easy to manipulate. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature's spirit.

## Mohler

Mohlers are spined, pig-like beasts that corkscrew through the ground faster than they can run. Originating from deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface.

Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests—and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield and knock the orcs' enemies off their feet.

## Scyza

Orcs rely on giant flightless birds called scyzas to carry them over great distances. Orcs adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses of interconnected gondolas that freely swing along their thick plumage. The birds are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts.

The scyza's trunk-like legs and talons cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their razor-sharp beaks and crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.

## Dohma Raskovar

Dohma Raskovar is the latest in a long line of leaders—known as dohmas—of the Ivory Throne, a band of mercenaries. Under Raskovar's leadership, the throne has grown to over a hundred strong, and now they handle multiple contracts simultaneously, occasionally banding together to fight as a single unit in battle.

Raskovar runs the throne from the Hanging Tree, his tavern where he plays the role of barkeep. Here, clients in the know can discreetly indicate their desire to hire bounty hunters, cutthroats, or thieves by ordering a boiling oil, a mundane blend of whiskey and rum that appears on no menu.

Once the drink is ordered, Raskovar himself appears at the table, ready to do business. He prides himself on remaining politically neutral and treating all potential customers as equals, something that chafes a few of his clients. Many local nobles have stormed out of the Hanging Tree in a rage after Raskovar refused to use the proper forms of address—only to return later when their situation is more desperate, and pride too costly.
