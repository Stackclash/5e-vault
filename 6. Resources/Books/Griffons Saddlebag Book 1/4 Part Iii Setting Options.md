## The Everglacier

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/tgs1/Book/artwork-everglacier.webp#center)


The Everglacier is a massive, expanding mountain of ice that slowly encroaches on other lands. It is cold, desolate, and unforgiving. Ice forged from the glacier's core never melts and is a precious commodity used in weaponry.

The glacier itself is pure ice. However, persistent flora have grown over centuries in the center of the Everglacier, slowly creating a thin layer of soil to create a hardy tundra. This barely fertile tundra has yet to reach the region's barriers.

Hardy trees can grow here, which produce thermally sound lumber frequently used in houses. As a result, the homes in the Everglacier can be quite warm.

There's no running water in this frigid desert landscape. Peaks of pure ice make a pseudo-mountain range in the center of the region, but there are no springs or naturally flowing streams here. All freshwater is heated from the surface's ice. As a result, most homes have ice picks, with finer picks being highly prized. Plants that grow here have dense, powerful roots that can absorb water from the ice. Some fiery creatures have formed symbiotic relationships here with other beasts, creating a unique ecosystem and balance.

The everlasting ice comes from the center of the glacier, the Everheart. It's a slowly regrowing core of ice that perpetuates the cold magic in the Everglacier. The route to get there is always changing, however, and is a closely guarded secret by the local elders and craftsmen.

### Ambient Mood

The Everglacier shares more in common with deserts than it does ice and snow. It is cold, dry, and unforgiving. Wildfires, fed by the arid winds, burn out of control. For this reason, many of the settlements who call the Everglacier their home have forbidden fires. Instead, they rely on magic for warmth.

- Sounds on the Everglacier range from deathly silent to maddeningly noisy. The Growl itself (see below) can drown out all sound as can the howling winds through the ice canyons. Meanwhile, the icy plains are drenched in near silence.  
- There is an overwhelming eeriness to the Everglacier. Outsiders traveling on it feel at unease. There is something unnatural about the land and the glacier itself.  
- Plantlife grows on the Everglacier, but it isn't normal plant life. The flora of the Everglacier has learned to survive in the harsh, rocky, cold soil that dusts its top layers. These plants are strong and well-protected.  
- It's not uncommon to come across a fallen traveler while walking through the Everglacier, frozen solid. In some areas, especially near the Glass Mountains, these corpses act as landmarks for other travelers. The infamous Road of Claws is littered with the dead. It's said among the howling gales, one can hear the weeping of those who passed.  
- Glacier fog is common. Drawing its power from the innate magic of the glacier, the fog that permeates the Everglacier operates similar to the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]] spell.  
- Gruesome standards and warnings are everywhere in the Everglacier. Most are created by the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|frost giant]] tribes who call the glacier their home, but the orcs have just as many planted throughout. These standards are often made of the frozen heads of their fallen enemies. Some are even lit with magical blue fire.  

> [!note] Optional Rule: Day and Night
> 
> Due to its presence near the northern pole, day and night cycles are irregular throughout the year. During the height of summer, in weeks before and after the summer solstice, the sun doesn't set. Around midnight, it hovers over the horizon before climbing back into the sky. Similarly, the sun never rises in the dead of winter. At most, the sky grows a shade lighter close to the noon hour.
> 
> Lastly, when you select this race, you can choose to be Small, instead of Medium.
> 
> **White Nights.** If a creature unaccustomed to the Ever-glacier's long days tries to complete a long rest during the white nights, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is unable to rest for 12 hours and does not gain the benefits of the long rest.
> 
> **Dark Days.** While the Everglacier is always cold, it's especially cold during the dark days, dropping as low as –50 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the chance for encounters increases by 5–10%. For example, if the normal chance for an encounter is 18–20 on a roll of a d20, it's 17–20 during the dark days.
^optional-rule-day-and-night

### The Growl

When the Everglacier runs against ships, islands, or land, it creates earthquakes. These massive events reverberate over the entire ice-shelf. The sound caused by these earthquakes resembles a low growl, like that of a prowling cat.

To check whether or not The Growl occurs, every 8 hours (morning, afternoon, and night), roll a d20. On a roll of 20, a Growl occurs. Refer to the Growl Results table below to check the severity of the Growl.

**The Growl Results**

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^the-growl-results]]`

| dice: d100 | Result |
|------------|--------|
| 01–60 | Minor Collision. The ground shakes slightly. |
| 61–99 | Major Collision. The ground shakes for 2d6 rounds. Each creature unaccustomed to living or traveling through the Everglacier must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (creature's choice) at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature falls prone. |
| 100 | Catastrophic Collision. The ground shakes violently. Treat the entirety of the Everglacier as if it is under the effects of the earthquake spell with the requisite saving throws made against a DC equal to 2d10 + 5. Fissures open along the Everglacier at the GM's discretion. |
^the-growl-results

### Exploration

Thanks to the Everglacier's ever-changing nature, exploration can be a difficult task, even for the wisest ranger. Because of the cold, wind, and dryness, travel is slow. Characters moving at a normal pace can travel 10 miles per day on foot through the untamed terrain of the Everglacier.

If the characters move at a fast pace, have them roll a d4. On a roll of 1 or 2, they travel the same distance as a group moving at a normal pace, despite their best efforts. On a result of 3 or 4, they successfully double their movement for the day; as normal, characters moving at a fast pace take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, making them more likely to miss clues and walk into ambushes.

Similarly, if the characters set a slow pace, roll a d4. On a roll of 1 or 2, they advance only 5 miles that day. On any other result, their caution is rewarded, and they travel the same distance as a group moving at a normal pace. Slow-paced movement allows characters to move stealthily. They can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.

#### Navigation

One character should act as a navigator, either a player's character or an NPC. At the start of each new travel day, the GM makes a Wisdom (Survival) check on behalf of the navigator. The result of the check determines whether or not the party becomes lost over the course of the day. The DC of the check is 2d10 + 5. Apply a +5 bonus to the check if the group sets a slow pace for the day, or a –5 penalty if the group is moving at a fast pace.

If the check succeeds, the navigator knows exactly where the party is on the Everglacier in regards to permanent locations and landmarks.

If the check fails, the party becomes lost. The navigator can repeat the check after the party spends 1d6 hours trying to get back on course.

#### Flora & Foraging

While plants are not completely absent from the Everglacier, they are extremely difficult to find. A foraging character makes a Wisdom (Survival) check as normal, but the DC is 4d6 + 5.

If the check succeeds, the navigator knows exactly where the party is on the Everglacier in regards to permanent locations and landmarks.

On a failure, the character fails to find potable water or edible food. On a successful check, roll 1d4 + the character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds and roll 1d8 + the character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much water (in gallons) the character finds. Once potable water is found on the Everglacier, it's usually in greater supply than food.

##### Collecting Snow for Water

During a short rest, the characters can collect snow and boil it with a fire. In doing so, they can collect as much water as they need. Of course, fires on the Everglacier present a problem all its own.

#### Dagger Ice

Much of the ancient ice on the Everglacier has turned solid until its hardness is similar to that of jagged iron. Known as Dagger Ice, this dense material is immune to cold and resistant to fire. Through magic and patience, a blacksmith can reforge the material into weapons and armor.

#### Fires in the Everglacier

Due to the lack of large quantities of liquid water and the constant winds of the Everglacier, fires represent a major hazard. When an object or creature is set on fire, any skill check or saving throw made to extinguish the flame is made with disadvantage. If extinguishing the flames only requires an action with no check, it instead requires a DC 10 Dexterity check. Failure means that the fire continues to burn.

#### Weather on the Everglacier

Precipitation is surprisingly rare on the Everglacier; the glacier sees no more than 2 inches of snowfall each year and blizzards are few and far between. However, the wind can be severe. Every 8 hours, roll a d6. On a result of 5–6, the wind is moderate. Otherwise, the winds are strong winds. Strong winds impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. It extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible.

### Example Encounters

The Everglacier is home to many dangers. While the characters travel through the Everglacier, roll a d20 three times per day that passes in game. An encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher. Check the Everglacier Encounters table below to determine the nature of the encounter. Of course, you're free to change this list of encounters to better match your campaign.

### Ruins & Dungeons

Despite the Everglacier being a mobile continent of solid ice, it is still home to many unusual locales. Both the wild and native inhabitants of the glacier have dug out caves, caverns, and tunnels through the ice. Fortresses built from solid Dagger Ice are also present; the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|frost giants]], in particular, use their cold-bending sorcery to build these foreboding structures.

In areas where the glacier breaks apart to reveal the ocean's cold depths, sea creatures such as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Merfo(LK).md\|merfolk]] and [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Sahuagin.md\|sahuagin]] (who've grown accustomed to the climate), create elaborate maze-like passages in the submerged ice. While uninviting to creatures who lack the constitution to survive in such environments, those who dare enter often find heaps of treasure, the majority of which the aquatic creatures stripped from vessels destroyed by the Everglacier's walls.

It's not uncommon for settlements to rise up on the Everglacier, then fall to ruin. The Growl, [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|frost giant]] raids, and even aggressive blizzards are all responsible for destroying villages and cities that may have once prospered in this unforgiving environment.

#### Example Dungeons

If you need help generating ideas for dungeons and points-of-interest on the Everglacier, roll on the Everglacier Dungeon table below.

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^example-dungeon]]`

| dice: d6 | Example Dungeon |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | A [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|frost giant]] [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Vampire.md\|vampire]] has built a palace of ice into the cliffs of an ice mountain. In addition to the typical creatures one expects to find within a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|frost giant's]] keep, there are undead horrors that wait in the cold, dark depths. |
| 2 | An ice field is pocked with dozens of huge holes that emit steam and scalding water. These are tunnels created by [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Remorhaz.md\|remorhazes]], whose warm touch allows them to burrow unhindered through the Everglacier's ice. The bones of carrion decorate their underice labyrinths. |
| 3 | Once home to quasi-celestial beings, this lost city lies in ruin. Its ancient streets are torn apart by ice daggers sprouting from the ground. Towers and temples sit cracked open like broken eggs, exposed to the environment. During the day, only the wind moves through the streets. But at night, something dark stirs. |
| 4 | Blades of steel-hard ice rise from the surface of the Everglacier, reaching fifty feet or more into the air. Throughout this unwelcoming razor-sharp canyon, elementals of all kinds rule: from cruel trickster mephits to massive warriors made of solid ice to gargantuan tempests. None of these creatures enjoy the presence of the living. |
| 5 | A graveyard of frozen pirate ships dominates the bottom of a pit. The ghosts of the sea dogs rise from the busted hulls protecting the loot and other ill-gotten gains they once sailed with. |
| 6 | Swallowed whole by the Everglacier, this island community used its powerful druidic magic to protect it from total assimilation by the arctic environment. The spellcasters then turned the event into a boon, using the glacier's inhospitable nature to protect their dark secrets. |

### Settlements

The Everglacier is a difficult place to call home, but not impossible. Solid dagger-ice makes for strong building materials—if one can mold it, of course. Holes and caverns in the ice are also common, especially for the non-intelligent residents of the glacier. Everglacial lumberers and tanners have developed techniques to build wigwams capable of withstanding the glacier's cruel winds and crueler temperatures. Of course, igloos are a popular shelter, too.

#### Suggested Inhabitants

Creatures adapted to extreme cold and winter conditions thrive on the Everglacier. [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|Frost giants]] are particularly everpresent, having multiple settlements built from the hard ice of the glacier. At least three major orc tribes call the glacier home: the Windshadow, Bloodice, and Stripjaws. Creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth such as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Earth Element(AL).md\|earth elementals]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Gargoyle.md\|gargoyles]], and [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Dust Mephit.md\|dust mephits]] also live on the glacier. Humanoids live on the glacier, but tend towards nomadic cultures as The Growl frequently destroys permanent settlements.

#### Example Settlements

Consider using these sample ideas as inspiration when building settlements in the Everglacier:

- A massive fortress made of solid ice stands at the top of high, sheer ice-cliff. Living within this compound are thousands of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Orc.md\|orcs]]. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Orc.md\|orcs]] conquered the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|frost giant]] king who created the fortress. Rumor has it that the king still lives, hiding at the heart of the structure.  
- Everglacier nomads—mostly human with some elves and half-orcs—have created a temporary village to last through the coming winter. Their companion animals surround the village, protecting it from the dangers of the ice.  
- A community of ice [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Kobold.md\|kobolds]] worships a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Young White Dragon.md\|young adult white dragon]] who pretends to be their god. Overall, the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Kobold.md\|kobolds]] are friendly—if devious—and willing to trade with outsiders. They live within a series of unusual multi-tier igloos that look like a massive web of ice.  
- Along the underside of the Everglacier, a kingdom of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Merfo(LK).md\|merfolk]] adapted to the cold thrives. They've placed massive ice daggers facing outward from their kingdom. This protects their kingdom from running aground when the Everglacier bumps against a large landmass. Conveniently, it also helps the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Merfo(LK).md\|merfolk]] capture errant ships, large aquatic animals, and other surprises that helps support the community.  

### Example Treasure

When selecting treasure for the Everglacier, think about the creatures and inhabitants that live there. Items meant to help with or control bitter cold, winds, or ice are all good choices. Other items that are thematic to the creatures that live here, such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mammoth Boots (TGS1).md\|mammoth boots]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Warmind Wand (TGS1).md\|warmind wand]] may also be appropriate choices for their relation to the mammoths in the area and tribal orcs that hunt there.

Of course, any item that directly references the Everglacier is a sure fit. These include [[5. Mechanics/Items/Chillspike (TGS1).md\|chillspike]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crown Of Deep Winter (TGS1).md\|crown of deep winter]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ice Sickle (TGS1).md\|ice sickle]], and [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sheer Cold (TGS1).md\|sheer cold]]. Other related items that aren't directly referenced but are nevertheless thematic could also include the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Container Of Heat And Frost (TGS1).md\|container of heat and frost]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Everice Box (TGS1).md\|everice box]], and [[5. Mechanics/Items/Frozen Dagger (TGS1).md\|frozen dagger]].

## The Festerwood

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/tgs1/Book/artwork-the-festerwood.webp#center)


The Festerwood is a large, underground forest ecosystem that is miraculously self-sustaining through its frequent natural cycles of life and death. Flora in the Festerwood is largely devoid of color, relying on hardiness and slow growth to survive. Color makes for a prime target in this otherwise gray landscape. When a tree dies, it is quickly reborn as a host of mushrooms and loamy soil. The entirety of the forest floor of the Festerwood is soft and spongy: the result of many life cycles of growth and decay.

The bountiful array of fungus growing in the Festerwood is matched only by its population of beetles and other insects. Swarms of insects plague the forest, devouring the most easily available nutrients before moving on.

The Festerwood is unsettling, to say the least. Many strange plants and insects thrive in this forest, feasting on those foolish enough to cross into it. Despite that, some intelligent creatures have made this place their home, and may have interesting rewards, requests, or stories for your players to experience.

### Ambient Mood

The air is damp and stale, filled with the scent of mildew. While there is no breeze here underground, the slow movement of cool air replacing the warm air of the surface brings some small comfort. Trees creak as if their branches ache, echoing discordantly throughout the wood. Slowly pulsing ambient yellow light peaks though the forest as small clusters of strange knots made from an amber-looking substance break through the trees' barked exterior. The soil is loamy and soft, but oily to the touch and perpetually fetid. Small pools and trickles of water can be found, although their origin and quality are always questionable.

- The Festerwood is typically quiet, as the sounds of walking feet are muffled by the soft ground. The only discordance breaking through the silence are the echoes of creaking wood and the thrumming of insect swarms.  
- Play up the closeness of the trees. Despite being underground, festerwood trees have unusually thick trunks and grow very close together. A variety of small to middling flora and fungi grow in the few openings between fallen tree branches and occasional gaps in the trees.  
- Fungus grows on almost everything here. Only on very rare occasions is it safe to eat. An exceptionally skilled survivalist, cook, or herbalist can attempt to identify and forage for edible varieties. Use sensory language about the smell, texture, and color of these varieties.  
- At the center of the Festerwood, an enormous, glowing mushroom called the Lightspore sheds dim light across the forest. While adventuring, a party will likely use that as their main landmark.  
- The temperature is constant due to the Festerwood's placement underground. Combined with the strange, ambient light sources within the forest, this makes it very difficult for a creature to tell what time it is or how long they've been inside the forest.  
- Some patches of earth dip downward suddenly, having filled in a previously exposed sink hole. Similarly, various flat areas will abruptly drop into an earthen pit.  
- Emphasize how repetitive the trees become over time. While there are an enormously large number of varieties of fungi and underbrush, the innumerable festerwood trees are very nearly identical to one another. Navigating the Festerwood is very difficult for inexperienced travelers because of the scarcity of prominent landmarks.  
- Because of the tight spaces created by the crowding trees and fierce underbrush, the Festerwood promises numerous hidden areas and sudden chance discoveries. For that same reason, when creatures are hunting or hungry, they thrive on ambush.  

### Light in the Festerwood

At the center of the Festerwood is the Lightspore: a colossal, glowing mushroom that drives the natural order of the wood. Although sunlight evades the Festerwood, the Lightspore provides its own perpetual bioluminescence. The light fluctuates in a repeating cycle of dim light and near darkness. Each cycle of light takes place over 8 hours. At its brightest, the Lightspore covers the entire Festerwood in a twilight of blue and purple light, but when it's darkened, the light cast by the mushroom is merely reminiscent of a partially cloud-covered moon.

#### The Lightspore

At the base of its stalk, the Lightspore's light is considered bright light during its light cycle, and dim when it's darkened. The area surrounding the mushroom is devoid of other plantlife in a 1,000-foot radius around its gargantuan base. If you choose to include a town in the Festerwood for your campaign, this may be an ideal location for it—depending on the inhabitants you choose to place there. See the Settlements segment later in this document for more insights into what type of creatures might call this place home.

The Lightspore's stalk is roughly 750 feet in diameter at ground level. The cavernous cap of the great mushroom extends roughly 1,250 feet out from its base, totaling almost three quarters of a mile across from edge to edge. With a texture almost like marble, both cap and stalk emit an identical fluctuating glow of magenta, blue, and purple light. Its flesh is a pale blue, but due to its size, no other discernible features have been found.

### Dangerous Spores

The spores that drift from the Lightspore are toxic. Many creatures native to the Festerwood developed a resistance to their harmful effects centuries ago, making surface-dwelling visitors the easiest to fall victim.

When a creature is subjected to enough of these spores, they become a shambling husk of their former self. These husks become relentlessly driven to slowly migrate toward the Lightspore, ignoring calls to sleep or eat until they have reached the foot of the mighty fungus. The details on sporehusks are found at the end of this section.

Once a sporehusk reaches the stalk of the Lightspore, it becomes frozen in place and does not move as it eventually dies. [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Risen Sporehusk (TGS1).md\|Risen Sporehusk]] immediately collapse at the base.

> [!note] Transformative Spores
> 
> At the end of every 24 hours that a creature spends above ground in the Festerwood, that creature is forced to make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, that creature gains one Spore Counter. Rolling a 1 on this saving throw is always considered a failure, regardless of the roll's total. If a creature reaches 3 Spore Counters, that creature becomes a sporehusk using the template at the end of this section.
^transformative-spores

If a creature dies and has at least one Spore Counter, the corpse rises after 24 hours as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Risen Sporehusk (TGS1).md\|Risen Sporehusk]]. If a hungering creature eats a husk, it automatically gains two Spore Counters.

A creature is immune to these spores if it's immune to disease. One Spore Counter can be removed when a creature becomes the target of a lesser restoration spell or similar magic. If a creature does not gain any Spore Counters over a period of 5 days, any remaining Counters are removed.

### Exploration

The Festerwood's abundance of claustrophobic spaces and scarcity of identifiable landmarks makes it challenging to navigate. Most traveled pathways are along the occasional narrow trails of water that are scattered throughout the wood. As a result, it can be particularly difficult to pinpoint the same location twice without proper expertise and preparation.

#### Navigation

> [!note] Traveling in the Festerwood
> 
> **Navigation.** The repetitive nature of the wood makes it troublesome to find a specific location without luck or practice. Traveling anywhere besides the Lightspore's stalk or beneath its cap requires a navigation check based on its location within the Festerwood.
> 
> **Foraging.** DC 14; water is uncommon, and light game excels at hiding. Experienced characters can forage for edible plants and fungi among the mostly poisonous flora (DC 16). If a creature normally eats insects instead of traditional game, the foraging DC becomes 10 instead.
> 
> **Special Rules.** Every 24 hours a creature spends in the Festerwood, it must roll a d20 to see if it gains a Spore Counte
^traveling-in-the-festerwood

Because of the wood's unmoving light source, creatures are always able to tell which direction leads towards the Lightspore. However, the scarcity of other landmarks and lack of astral bodies make it difficult for the average traveler to judge anything further. Failing a navigation check causes you to become lost and roll on the Becoming Lost table.

**Festerwood Navigation DCs**

| DC | Location |
|----|----------|
| None | The Lightspore |
| None | Any unhidden location beneath the Lightspore |
| 15 | A location nearby the Lightspore or among the sparse edges of the forest |
| 20 | A location one or more miles into the forest |
| 25 | A location hidden deep within the thickest and most feral part of the Festerwood |

#### Flora & Foraging

Within the Festerwood is a rich ecosystem of exotic plants and fungi. A character that is experienced with foraging (or exceptionally lucky) may be able to collect and identify certain edible flora following a successful DC 16 foraging check. The resources found by successful foraging are nutritious and safe for ingestion. If a character rolls a 20 or higher on their foraging check, roll on the Exceptional Foraged Food table to determine if the foraged food grants any additional benefits.

On the other hand, eating hazardous foraged foods can have dangerous consequences. When a character eats food found by a failed foraging check, they must roll on the Dangerous Foraged Food table to determine if any adverse effects occur. Regardless of the outcome, the character is not sustained by the food.

**Exceptional Foraged Food**

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^exceptional-foraged-food]]`

| dice: d6 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1-4 | The food is enough to sustain the character for up to 24 hours. |
| 5-6 | The character is nourished for 24 hours and removes one Spore Counter if it has any. |
^exceptional-foraged-food

**Dangerous Foraged Food**

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^dangerous-foraged-food]]`

| dice: d6 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The character is poisoned for next 8 hours and gains one Spore Counter. |
| 2-5 | The character is poisoned for 1 hour. |
| 6 | The character is not nourished but suffers no other ill effects. |

#### Collecting Amber Pustules

The bit of amber covering the trees in the Festerwood are unique to the forest. These organic gem-like pustules glow with a dim yellow light and allow the tree to grow using the unnatural luminescence from the Lightspore. The pustules are toxic to creatures and other plants, inflicting 1 acid damage for every round (10 acid damage for every minute) that the pustule is in physical contact.

Most veins of this amber are found in narrow channels along the grain of a tree. Occasionally, it can coalesce into a larger knot or clump. To the right buyer, a fist-sized chunk of the glowing amber can sell for as much as 100 gp. Transporting the amber is difficult because it burns through most containers. Festerwood is uniquely immune to the amber's acid, so collectors in the wood can be identified by their small festerwood chests.

Festerwood trees are extremely difficult to cut down or carve, acting like a strange metal instead of wood.

### Example Encounters

The forest is filled with potential, both good and bad. Use this table for to fill out your party's time in the Festerwood with exciting and flavorful encounters and events:

| 3 | An odd twisting of the large festerwood tree branches seems to align and spell the word 'resistance' in celestial. Saying the word aloud causes the speaker and up to 4 allies of their choice within 60 feet to become the target of a lesser restoration spell. If a character loses a Spore Counter in this way, the next time that they are forced to roll to see if they gain a spore counter, they must roll a 1 to gain one Spore Counter. |

### Ruins & Dungeons

Because of the soft ground, most stony caves within the Festerwood are pathways to and from it instead of contained caverns. However, because of the dense root systems and strength of Festerwood lumber, dungeons and hidden passageways can potentially be found underneath any tree in the woods. Some entrances become exposed when a sinkhole suddenly appears underfoot, or when a stream eventually erodes enough of the surrounding soil to uncover it. Other entrances can be found in the tangles of exposed roots beneath the great trees. In very rare cases, they can be found carved into the trees themselves.

When making a dungeon in the Festerwood, remember the moist nature of the surrounding earth and the eerie creaking of the trees. Ambient light within the dungeon can be found as amber pustules exposed on roots or as small glowing fungus along the floors. Regardless of the purpose of the area's existence, be sure to play up the fetid, earthy smells, the soggy atmosphere and creaking noises, and powerful sense of unease that exudes from the Festerwood.

#### Example Dungeons

The Festerwood has the potential for magical secrets and dungeons to exist within it, including the following:

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^example-dungeon]]`

| dice: d6 | Example Dungeon |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | On top of the Lightspore, a colony of kobolds worship their black dragon overlord. They have carved out a network of caves and tunnels within the Lightspore's cap, and rumors tell of a dark blessing being bestowed upon them. |
| 2 | Somewhere near the edge of the Lightspore, a cult of necromancers has learned how to control the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Risen Sporehusk (TGS1).md\|Risen Sporehusks]] along with their more typical undead servants. Their arcane knowledge threatens to destroy the natural order by raising and controlling the hundreds of Sporehusks below the Lightspore. |
| 3 | The goblinoids have continued to thrive in the Festerwood's hazardous environment: a tribe of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bugbear.md\|bugbears]] and their [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Goblin.md\|goblin]] peasantry ravage the forest on their trained [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Wolf.md\|wolf]] mounts, gathering supplies for their nomadic existence. They stand as a looming threat against all travelers and settlers of the wood due to their large numbers and extensive use of amber pustules and fungal toxins in their arsenal. |
| 4 | While there was once a community of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Deep Gnome Svirfneblin.md\|deep gnomes]] under the Lightspore in decades past, an invasion from slaving [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Duergar.md\|Duergar]] has held sway in the Festerwood for years now. With their utilitarian crafting skills and slave labor, they have amassed a stronghold full of festerwood defenses, weaponry, and magics to fuel their expansion. |
| 5 | Hidden in the depths of the Festerwood, a circle of corrupt [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Druid.md\|druids]] seeks to harness the power of the Lightspore. They've come well prepared with large numbers, festerwood armor, and magical weaponry to accompany their frenzied crusade. |
| 6 | Long exiled from their tribe on the surface and cursed with fleshy deformities, a clan of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Orc.md\|orcs]] have eked out a miserable existence in the Festerwood's network of root-supported caves. Recent threats have pushed them to new and dangerous magics, activating a vile sort of symbiosis with the local insects, transforming the starving [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Orc.md\|orcs]] into moving sentient hive horrors with a craving for flesh. |
^example-dungeon

### Settlements

Most settlements within the Festerwood are likely to be found beneath the Lightspore or among the branches of the forest canopy. Staying within one of these towns for a prolonged period of time may improve your defenses against the perpetual toxic spores from the Lightspore if you spend sufficient time indoors.

The materials used in building Festerwood settlements can vary based on the culture that founded it. Stone masonry brought in from the underground forest's cavernous walls may be used, as well as natural fibers from the sundry plants in the area. Skilled craftsman experienced with working with local materials may also be able to provide lumber to construct durable festerwood buildings.

These settlements would likely prioritize defense against invasive swarms over hearty welcomes and cheerful attitudes. Unlike their surface counterparts, these settlers would forgo colorful decorations in favor of survival.

#### Suggested Inhabitants

Classic underground-dwelling creatures may make these settlements their home, with dwarves and [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Deep Gnome Svirfneblin.md\|deep gnomes]] being the friendliest options. Other unsavory creatures such as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Drow.md\|drow]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Duergar.md\|duergar]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Goblin.md\|goblins]], or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Kobold.md\|kobolds]] could create their own settlements here as well.

#### Example Settlements

Consider using these sample ideas as inspiration when building your own settlements within the Festerwood:

- Blocks of worked stone, dragged miles from the forest's stone walls hundreds of years ago, make up a muted community of dwarves beneath the Lightspore who excel at working with the unnaturally dense festerwood.  
- A tangle of hollowed branches, trunks, and woven plant fibers make a comfortable nest among the trees, giving a settlement of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Drow.md\|drow]] hunters a dim and safe place to reside while satisfying their ancient fey affinity for trees and plant life.  
- Deep within the thickets and roots of the Dim Marsh, [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Kobold.md\|kobolds]] gather resources to offer unto the great black dragon that they believe is living atop the Lightspore.  
- The large shelf fungi of the Eastern Quarter of the Festerwood is a protective barrier for the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Deep Gnome Svirfneblin.md\|deep gnomes]] that call it home. Small, tangled webs of bridges weave their way between the mushrooms to form an elevated highway of foot traffic among the sturdy trees.

### Example Treasure

When determining treasure for the Festerwood, consider the denizens that live there. Items that are suited for creatures who live in darkness or deal with swamps or poison, such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Plaguebane Mask (TGS1).md\|plaguebane mask]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quagmire Maul (TGS1).md\|quagmire maul]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Retaliating Bloom Shield (TGS1).md\|retaliating bloom shield]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shadowshawl (TGS1).md\|shadowshawl]], or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Snuff (TGS1).md\|snuff]] may all be good fits. Other more woodland-themed items, such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Druidic Throwing Club (TGS1).md\|druidic throwing club]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Timber (TGS1).md\|timber]], or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Trident Of The Dryad (TGS1).md\|trident of the dryad]] may also be good fits depending on the nature of any woodsmen or druids living within the wood. Of course, any item with "Festerwood" in its name is a perfect fit for this environment.

## Welcome to Hearth

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/tgs1/Book/artwork-welcome-to-hearth.webp#center)


Thousands of years ago, the lush isle of Elsath was home to a majestic and influential city named Hearth. There, its citizens thrived under the watchful eye of the couatls: great, celestial serpents whose wisdom and kindness served as the guiding force behind the city's splendor. A theocratic society, the couatls' high priests were revered and respected by all—even the most hardened criminals. These priests were called the Couatl Heralds and served as Hearth's humanoid leaders, guardians, and peacekeepers.

However, the city was often the target of forces hell-bent on the couatls' destruction. During a month-long battle, a trio of evil conjurers infiltrated the city's walls and summoned hundreds of their wicked followers. Hearth crumbled under the sudden assault as men, women, and children fell to their wicked blades. Realizing that nearly all was lost, the couatls and Heralds performed a ritual that hid Hearth from the rest of the world, isolating them and the villainous forces for untold centuries.

Over time, the magic weakened. The city rejoined the world, but had long since been forgotten. The evil that endured the city's isolation had begun to recover, but was found and vanquished by a band of heroes now known as the Last Heralds. Safe once more, Hearth was reborn as a destination for adventurers, explorers, and historians. It's also become a place where one can disappear from the rest of the world. As such, its vine-choked streets and crumbling buildings hide criminals, thugs, and would-be warlords, too.

### How to Use This Content

The content provided here describes Hearth as "setting-agnostic" meaning that you can add Hearth to any fifth edition campaign setting of your choice, especially one that incorporates a jungle or "Lost World" theme. Hearth can be used as a jumping-off point for your fifth edition campaign, a major city that the characters visit, or even the setting for an adventure within the confines of the city itself.

### Locations in Hearth

Once a bustling metropolis of close to 100,000 people, Hearth's streets are mostly empty. Since its liberation, only 3,200 have returned to Hearth, the majority of which are Rushers staking their claim on the city's revived properties.

The map of Hearth on page 191 shows many of the important locations in Hearth where the characters can interact with important NPCs and find adventure. These locations are detailed below.

#### Teocalli Ward

Once the religious center of Hearth, Teocalli Ward is home to its majestic temples and plazas. Whereas ancient Hearthans once gathered to celebrate the couatl overseers and praise their gods, it now acts as the epicenter of law and order in Hearth. The Couatl Herald faction's presence is felt strongest in this location.

##### 1. Teocalli Couatl

Easily the most impressive feature of Hearth, Teocalli Couatl is the massive multi-tiered ziggurat that dominates the city's skyline. When the Last Heralds entered Hearth, they descended to its lowest layers to battle an aberrant demigod.

Although the temple is mostly restored, overall, it's off-limits to virtually everyone in Hearth, including most of the Couatl Heralds who protect it.

##### 2. Ulama Tastei

Thousands of years ago, the Hearthans invented a sport called ulama. The game and its rules fell into obscurity when Hearth disappeared, but was revived with the city's reopening. Now, ulama is a uniting aspect of New Hearthan culture and its people. The game is played on a long field, called a tastei, surrounded with stone walls and hoops. Citizens can often be seen playing the game, with audiences of varying sizes sitting in the ancient stone stands.

##### 3. Ixpa Temple

Although Hearth has no true government, the Couatl Heralds represent what most Hearthans view as the reborn city's leadership. The Heralds prefer to share their power with the other factions of Hearth, including those who oppose them. As such, the old Ixpa Temple at the northeastern corner of the city acts as a meeting place for Hearth's factions and other persons of importance.

##### 4. Huitzilli Plaza

Teocalli isn't just for temples and government buildings. Huitzilli Plaza stands at the southeastern end of the ward. There, Hearthans gather for celebrations and other recreational activities. It's also where one can find The Jolly Toad, the city's largest tavern. The Toad is owned by Chikkoka, a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Lizardfo(LK).md\|lizardfolk]] bartender who lived in Hearth before its liberation. The Toad offers a comfortable inn stay and meals.

##### 5. Hall of Hearlds

The Hall of Heralds is the faction stronghold for Hearth's best known faction, the Couatl Heralds. Acalan Goldfeather, the Heralds' elected leader, lives on site.

#### Market Ward

The Market Ward is the busiest section of Hearth. Not only do the residents of New Hearth gather in its cobblestone plazas to peruse the endless selection of offerings from local and foreign merchants, but it is also a point of interest for many of Hearth's visitors. Market Ward is presided over by the powerful merchant house Santin.

##### 6. The Market

Hundreds of vendors from across the world have set up stalls in Hearth's market. There isn't an hour of the day where the market's streets aren't cluttered with buyers and sellers. Exotic fruits, weapons, trade goods, adventuring supplies—you name it—can be found somewhere in Hearth's market.

##### 7. Santin Hill

The second tallest point in Hearth, next to Teocalli Couatl, belongs to House Santin's fortress, Santin Hill. Atop Santin Hill is the manor that shares its name and the home of House Santin's Beltramo Santin, the wealthiest man in Hearth. The hill itself is swarmed by House Santin's spellcasting mercenary army, The Hollow Herd, recognizable by their tall, bronze collars.

#### Rusher Ward

When Hearth's doors reopened to the world, the first batch of opportunists who flooded its streets were nicknamed "Rushers." The first Rushers were inexperienced adventurers. Many of them met their fate in the city itself, succumbing to the dangers hidden among the city's ruins. Others perished in the surrounding environment. Those who survived prospered and developed Rusher Ward, what many see as the nobles' section of New Hearth.

##### 8. The Oracle Eqia

The Oracle Eqia (lawful neutral female human [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Mage.md\|mage]]) was once a diviner who spent her youth adventuring. After she died during a combat with [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Manticore.md\|manticores]] and was revived by her fellow party members, she returned with a vision of a hill upon which stood three palms. A voice whispered "Hearth." She quit her party and rushed to Hearth to find the three palm hill. So far, she has not discovered its meaning, but continues her research.

##### 9. Devona the Mace

Devona (lawful evil female human [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gladia(TOR).md\|gladiator]]) was a mercenary and [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit.md\|bandit]] who was among the first batch of Rushers entering Hearth. Early on, she carved out a niche for herself as a protector and bodyguard. She married her first client, Jacco Nuus, who died shortly after their wedding. Jacco left Devona all his worldly possessions, including his land stakes. Six months later, she married another client, Wyndom Taz. Then Wyndom died, and once again Devona was left all her late husband's possessions and land stakes. In fact, in the five years that Devona has lived in Hearth, she's married six times, and five of those times her husband died. Not-so-coincidently, she is the wealthiest land owner in Hearth.

#### Ruins of Hearth

Much of Hearth still lies in ruins, especially the areas outside the walls and to the north and eastern sides of the city. Still, there are factions who operate within these areas.

##### 10. The Seven Gates

Surprisingly, Hearth's tall outer walls remained mostly intact during its centuries-long slumber. Entry into the city is blocked by seven gates. The seven gates are managed by a band of mercenaries named, appropriately, the Seven Gates. The Seven Gates claim the northernmost gate, Ocelot Gate, as their headquarters. The Ocelot Gate gets its name from the jaguar furs which drape the spiked, iron portcullis that blocks passage to the dangerous north end of the city.

##### 11. Keronia Stronghold

The Keronia Society, a faction of sages who use Hearth as their base of operations, maintains a well-protected stronghold just outside the city's westernmost gate. There, adventurers exchange important information, maps, and items of interest for gold, land claims, and other rewards.

### Random Locations in Hearth

Many of Hearth's buildings remain unoccupied. The majority are home to nothing more than creeper vines trickling in from the dense jungle that surrounds the ancient city. However, some act as lairs for strange creatures, fronts for dangerous gangs and cults, or even the entrance to lost tombs, dungeons, and caverns.

When the characters search a building in one of the ruined sections of Hearth, use the Building Type table below to determine what the location is or was. Then, roll a d6. On a result of 6, the location is being used or has something unique about it. Use the Building Use table below for inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what is unique about the building.

### Side Quests

Once the characters settle into Hearth and learn a little more about the city, they might encounter NPCs who need their help. While the characters are under no obligation to assist these NPCs, the side quests which evolve from these requests could lead to greater adventures, discoveries, and treasure.

You can introduce as many or as few of these side quests as you like. Most of the NPCs described below can be encountered anywhere in the city. If you can't decide which side quest to choose, roll a d10.

#### 1. Find the Grimoire of Massacres

The Keronia Society is looking for an important book believed to be hidden somewhere in the city's northern ruins. They will pay the characters 100 gp if they can retrieve the book. If the characters accept, they must spend a day searching through the ruins (roll for encounters as normal). At the end of the day, the characters must make a group DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a success, they locate the book in a rundown temple. The obscure temple is hidden behind dense vines and stone rubble, and is decorated with ornate depictions of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Couatl.md\|couatl]] inside. The book is guarded by 1d4 + 2 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Constrictor Snake.md\|giant constrictor snakes]].

#### 2. Get the Ocelot's Paw Back

A local gang of thugs called the Bludgeoners cut off the paw of an Ocelot statue near the northernmost gate. Many New Hearthans believe that the absence of the paw will bring bad luck to the city. The Seven Gates, stretched too thin to deal with the issue, task the characters to retrieve the paw, offering 25 gp for its recovery. The Bludgeoners operate in a rundown noble's villa at the north end of the city. The gang consists of eight [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit.md\|bandits]] led by a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit Captain.md\|bandit captain]].

#### 3. Learn More About Beltramiso Santin

Beltramo Santin's son, Beltramiso, is often identified as the weakest link in the Santin organization. The Seven Gates, hoping to diminish the power of the merchant house, asks the characters to learn whatever they can about Beltramiso. They offer 50 gp for each valuable detail they can learn (up to 250 gp). Beltramiso spends most of his days drinking and partying with regulars at The Jolly Toad.

#### 4. Save Preska

Preska, the daughter of a Rusher noble, was captured by a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Greater Winged Wretch (TGS1).md\|greater winged wretch]] (see page 195). The bat-like creature keeps the girl in its lair below the city, in the old sewers. Surprisingly, the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Greater Winged Wretch (TGS1).md\|greater winged wretch]] hasn't hurt the girl, but it refuses to let her leave its lair and attacks anyone that comes near her. The noble offers the characters whatever they ask for if they can return Preska to him unharmed.

#### 5. Find Baf Chedrov

Baf, a self-proclaimed adventurer, disappeared into the mountains near Hearth on a quest to find something for the Keronia Society. Unfortunately, no one has seen or heard from him in ten days. The Keronia Society offers the characters 50 gp if they can learn his whereabouts. Have one or more characters make two DC 15 ability checks: Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Survival). If both checks succeed, the characters find the remains of Baf in a small valley near the mountains. Baf was mauled by creatures and left for dead. At your discretion, the creatures might still be in the area.

#### 6. Stop the Swordbeak

A large, savage creature called a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swordbeak (TGS1).md\|swordbeak]] (see page 194) is terrorizing local ships, making the receipt of imports difficult. House Santin asks the characters to climb the cliffs overlooking the sea and remove the swordbeak from the area. If successful, House Santin offers the characters up to 100 gp or a favor which they can utilize in the future. The nature of that favor is up to you

#### 7. The Flash

Last night, a strange, bright flash happened in an old ruin at the northern edge of Hearth. The Couatl Heralds ask the characters to discover the origin of the flash. Performing this task successfully grants the characters a favor from the Heralds. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check leads the characters to a ruined library. In the basement of the library, the characters find an unstable portal to another plane of existence.

#### 8. Gain Iacopo's Trust

Iacopo Mazel, a high-ranking merchant in House Santin, makes the characters an offer they can't refuse: he will pay them 100 gp if they can find proof that the Seven Gates are actively working against them. This side quest could tie into the "Learn More About Beltramiso Santin" side quest.

#### 9. Discover Gaglin's Grotto

The Keronia Society asks the characters to locate a series of caverns in the mountains known as Gaglin's Grotto. Supposedly, a stalactite made of pure diamond is somewhere within the cavern. If the characters can find the entrance to the cavern and return with proof of the diamond stalactite's existence, they will pay the party 10% of the stalactite's value (500 gp). Of course, the cavern is home to a variety of fierce creatures.

#### 10. Test your Might

The characters get into a scuffle with a group of eight [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit.md\|bandits]] at a local tavern. Their leader, a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit Captain.md\|bandit captain]] named Davos, offers to settle the dispute with an arm wrestling contest: the loser has to leave the bar and apologize. If the party accepts, the characters must nominate their challenger to face Davos. The challenger and Davos make a series of contested Strength checks. At the end of each contested Strength check, the winner wins 1 point and the loser loses 1 point. The first person to reach a point total of 3 wins (the final score should be +3 to –3). Alternatively, the person with the highest number of positive points at the end of 10 rounds also wins; if both arm wrestlers have 0 points at the end of 10 rounds, it's a tie.

### City Denizens

Hearth is home to many important citizens, the majority of whom immigrated to the city when its gates reopened.

#### Acalan Goldfeather

Acalan Goldfeather (lawful good male human [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Veteran.md\|veteran]]) is a descendant of one of the original Couatl Heralds, Brother Riane. He now acts as the leader of the Couatl Heralds faction in New Hearth and is seen by many as the city's de facto leader, even though he refused the title.

Goldfeather spends most of his days speaking with the citizenry and solving issues that the city faces.

#### Amoxtli & Ehecatl

The centuries' old [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Couatl.md\|couatl]] guardians Amoxtli and Ehecatl survived Hearth's fall and now oversee the return of the city. The pair still live in the Teocalli Couatl where they helped the Last Heralds battle the evil demigod Black Tezcatlipoca. Rarely seen by New Hearthans, the pair sometimes emerge to offer guidance to Acalan and the other Heralds.

#### Beltramiso Santin

Son of Beltramo Santin (the true Beltramo, not the devil Torith), Beltramiso is the heir apparent of House Santin and its merchant empire. Unfortunately, Beltramiso is something of a troublemaker. Known for his drunken tirades, the merchant prince can often be found at The Jolly Toad picking fights with foreigners. So far, Torith has allowed Beltramiso to operate unhindered in Hearth, but fears that his "adopted son" may start drawing unwanted attention to House Santin and ultimately Torith's machinations. 

#### Beltramo Santin (Torith)

The true Beltramo Santin died years ago. A despicable barbed devil named Torith assumed Beltramo's place and now rules over Santin's family and his clan. Torith has grown Santin's small operation into a force to be reckoned with, thanks to the vacuum of economic power present in Hearth when House Santin first arrived.

The devil has kept his schemes at a minimum, preferring patience and growth over dominance. As such, not even the couatls, who spend their time in the Teocalli Couatl, or the Oracle Eqia are aware of the devil's presence in the city.

#### Grandmaster Zok Tuudro

Zok Tuudro (neutral male half-elf [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Mage.md\|mage]]) is the leader of the Keronia Society. A lifelong interest in the lost city attracted Zok and his followers to Hearth. Now, Zok spends his days hiring adventuring parties and expeditions to bring him maps, artifacts, and useful information regarding the city and its environs.

Zok's days are filled with meetings and presentations all directed by his assistant Guto, a native [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Lizardfo(LK).md\|lizardfolk]] who works as Keronia's receptionist. As suspected by some Hearthans, Zok doesn't sleep. Instead, he's trained to enter a trance like elves do, which he can maintain even while he's working.

#### Jadecry

Hearth is home to a myriad of adventuring groups, but none are as well known as the troupe called Jadecry. Led by the emerald-skinned Ana Faust (chaotic good female tiefling [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Knight.md\|knight]]), Jadecry keeps busy throughout the year, working for any faction that will pay them. Jadecry's current line-up includes the half-orc [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Berserker.md\|berserker]] Bluko, the halfling [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Mage.md\|mage]] Fafariaf, and a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Lizardfo(LK).md\|lizardfolk]] named Cracked Fang.

The four share a guild house in Rusher Ward dubbed The Green House.

#### Krotos Ironshield

Sometimes referred to as "The Jaguar," Krotos Ironshield (lawful neutral male dwarf [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Veteran.md\|veteran]]) is the leader of the Seven Gates mercenary collective. Krotos and his soldiers defend Hearth from dangers internal and external. Since many of The Seven Gates mercenaries come from questionable backgrounds, they are known to be harsh in their deliverance of law and order. Many New Hearthans have gone as far as to protest the activities of The Seven Gates, pleas that go unheard by their callous leader. Still, Ironshield is one of the few people in Hearth who is able to wrangle the mercenaries to work as a cohesive unit. In the past, this feature has saved New Hearth from a bevy of threats.

Krotos is in a close relationship with his lieutenant, Makkan. The two share a home within the westernmost tower of the Ocelot Gate.

#### Yolanda Kazul

The Seven Gates is less of a unified faction and more of a confederacy of smaller military groups. Each one maintains their iron grip on one of Hearth's gates and the guards defending it. Yolanda (neutral evil female human [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Thug.md\|thug]]) is the leader of aptly named Bloody Coins, the most unruly and mean-spirited gang of mercenaries. Yolanda and the Coins barely follow Ironshield's orders. In the last few months, Yolanda has started a campaign to undermine Krotos, gathering the interest of The Seven Gates' other five leaders.

Yolanda has two sons, Yar and Peef, both of whom are members of Bloody Coins. Their father was also a member, but died during a skirmish a few years back.

### Factions of Hearth

Since its reopening, Hearth has attracted multiple organizations who saw opportunity within its sandstone walls. Some of these factions could work with the characters, helping them achieve their goals. Others might hinder the characters' actions and act as antagonists.

#### The Seven Gates

Originally, The Seven Gates were made of seven individual organizations who claimed one of the city's seven gates. Recognizing the difficulty the individual groups had managing the gates and handling greater threats, the guilds united to form The Seven Gates under the leadership of Krotos Ironshield.

The Seven Gates handle the city's defenses. Some do so out of love for the city, while others demand coin for their services and are little more than extortionists.

#### Couatl Heralds

Frequently recognized as the "governors" of Hearth, the Couatl Heralds are a formal organization started by the Last Heralds, the same heroes who liberated Hearth. Led by Acalan Goldfeather, the Heralds strive to bring law and order to the city while balancing the citizens' need for freedom.

Additionally, the Heralds manage the relationships between the other three factions, whose interests often conflict.

Ultimately, the Heralds are guided by the wisdom of Amoxtli and Ehecatl, the two couatls who still reside in Teocalli Couatl at the center of the city. While only a select few Heralds are allowed to have an audience with the couatl, the Heralds' morality and wisdom are almost universally unquestioned by the citizens of Hearth.

#### House Santin

In the early days of its revival, a merchant named Beltramo Santin moved to Hearth and set up a market near the southern gates. Thanks to this strategic location (and a well-paid militia protecting his interests), House Santin grew from its humble roots into the seat of economic power in Hearth.

Secretly, Beltramo is a patient, keen-minded barbed devil named Torith who hopes to play the long game in Hearth's economic and political development.

House Santin often hires adventurers and mercenaries for clandestine missions to keep their hands clean of anything that would draw attention to their darker proclivities. Fortunately, Torith is a master bureaucrat. Any time anyone has tried to link him to something illegal, he and his merchants have been able to clear themselves of any wrongdoing.

#### Keronia Society

More so than any other faction in Hearth, the scholarly Keronia Society keeps adventurers busy inside and outside of the city. Zok, who is rumored to never sleep, always has some lost map, rumor, or strange key for which he will hire heroes to learn more about. Often, these leads turn up as dead ends. Even when they do, Zok still pays well.

### Monsters of Hearth

The jungles of Elsath surrounding Hearth have been untouched for centuries. As a result, a unique selection of dangerous wildlife calls this place their home, and have become a constant threat to the New Hearthans and adventurers that explore the wilderness in search of its lost riches.

### Example Treasure

The most iconic treasures you can find in Hearth are ones originally bestowed on ancient Couatl Heralds. These items are aptly named, such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Couatl Heralds Fang (TGS1).md\|couatl herald's fang]], the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Couatl Heralds Mantle (TGS1).md\|couatl herald's mantle]], or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Couatl Heralds Radiance (TGS1).md\|couatl herald's radiance]].

The jungles of Elsath and the myriad of tunnels below Hearth can also be the home of other magic items. A tarnished sword could be found in the mysterious den of a jealous [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swordbeak (TGS1).md\|swordbeak]], or a dusty trinket discovered on the skeletal remains of a Rusher or long-dead ancient Hearthan. Any item that fits a jungle or classic adventure setting, such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dryadleaf (TGS1).md\|dryadleaf]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Locksmiths Bane (TGS1).md\|locksmith's bane]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quagmire Maul (TGS1).md\|quagmire maul]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spire Seed (TGS1).md\|spire seed]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Staff Of The Reverent Warrior (TGS1).md\|staff of the reverent warrior]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Tethervine Quiver (TGS1).md\|tethervine quiver]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Torchbearers Reach (TGS1).md\|torchbearer's reach]], or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wisplight Lantern (TGS1).md\|wisplight lantern]], would be a great option to include in your party's various adventures in Hearth.

## The Fight Against Dendallen

[[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Nicrone Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Nicrone Dendallen]] is a human wizard whose passion for self-improvement has become an obsession, focused on removing the inherent limits of his own mortality. His focus on gaining power through sacrifice at any cost attracts dedicated sycophants. Their beliefs make them eager to recklessly endanger their lives for the chance to earn powerful rewards from his hand.

Dedicated and tenacious followers of Dendallen are given tokens of his appreciation: terrifying items made by Dendallen himself, each enchanted with a grotesque balance of strength and consequence.

While Dendallen is a master of the necromantic arts, his frustration with the limits of his mortal body makes him scoff at those who pursue longevity through undeath's tenuous hold on existence. Only under extreme circumstances or the promise of extreme rewards—is he willing to work with undead creatures or the magic that enables them.

### Teachings of Dendallen

Dendallen's belief that self-sacrifice leads to self-improvement is a fervent mantra held by his followers. In general, those that subscribe to Dendallen's teachings believe that in order to truly become greater, you must be willing to let go of the mortal trappings that bind you. The major tenets of Dendallen are as follows:

#### Embrace Self-Sacrifice

To forget the familiar as a price for greatness is admirable.

#### Conquer your Limits

To become more powerful is to embrace the purpose of life.

#### Enforce your Will

To conquer all obstacles in your path is to ensure success.

### Followers of Dendallen

Use the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Cultist.md\|cultist]] and [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Cult Fanatic.md\|cult fanatic]] statistics for followers of Dendallen. Dendallen's more powerful followers can use other humanoid stat blocks that fit your setting and party level. These leaders are groomed to be more formidable than those deemed undeserving, unproven, or mediocre.

Typically, these trusted followers of Dendallen will have overt visual ailments or symptoms of disease, but will be notably more powerful because of it. Elite followers such as this will occasionally wield a Remnant of Dendallen, bestowed unto them after they complete a dangerous or otherwise notable feat of faith, loyalty and self-sacrifice. Upon defeating such a creature, your party can take the Remnant for themselves. The particular Remnant each follower wields is up to you, but should be scaled relative to the creature's challenge rating.

### Slaying Nicrone Dendallen

Killing Nicrone allows for his spirit to return at a later time (see "Attuning to the Remnants" and "Dendallen's Return" later in this document). His final mortal words should capture his beliefs and foreshadow his return, such as "Giving up your weaknesses grants power beyond compare!"

> [!embed-monster]- Nicrone Dendallen
> ![[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Nicrone Dendallen (TGS1).md#^statblock\|Nicrone Dendallen]]

### Remnants of Dendallen

Items created by Dendallen are called Remnants of Dendallen and double as vessels to store a portion of his spirit. At the time of his death, these Remnants can be scattered around the planes of existence or collected by his remaining devout followers: whatever makes the most sense for your campaign. Any item that bears Dendallen's name in its title is considered to be a Remnant.

Remnants are laced with necromancy magic that forces creatures to sacrifice a part of themselves in order to use them. The sacrifices, while potentially reversible, are more than just skin-or-bone-deep. As curses take hold, they begin to gradually provide strength and vitality to the lingering [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|spirit of Dendallen]] trapped inside them.

If a creature attuned to at least one Remnant is in the presence of another Remnant that isn't attuned to by someone else, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with it and do anything within its power to take and attune to that Remnant before another creature is able to. The obsession lasts until the creature is unable to see or touch the Remnant for at least 1 hour or until it's targeted by either a greater restoration or remove curse spell.

#### Attuning to the Remnants

Attuning to three Remnants of Dendallen is a gift as well as a curse. While a creature is attuned to three of these items, it can freely attune to other Remnants of Dendallen. When it does, its attunement to another Remnant ends, as well as its curse.

If Dendallen is dead, being attuned to these items activates a secondary effect once you reach level 15 (or 14 if there are 5 players in your group, etc.). When this happens, the attuned creature's cursed body becomes strong enough to handle the intensity of channeling the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]]. The event is involuntary, and happens either at the end of a long rest or at your discretion. See the stat block for the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]] on page 200.

#### Dendallen's Return

When the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]] is channeled by a level 15 creature attuned to 3 of his Remnants, they become momentarily frozen in place. While unmoving, the creature's body begins to overflow in a torrent of green arcane and necrotic energy that spills forth from their back. The energy coalesces above them to form the towering, spectral avatar of Nicrone Dendallen's returned form: the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]]. Its hulking, necromantically-charged form looms over the hosted creature and drips with ooze-like green necrotic ectoplasm.

The scraps of Nicrone Dendallen's spirit that were anchored in his Remnants combine to form the new spirit. These once-weak shards have been empowered as the attuned creature has sacrificed aspects of themselves through the items' various curses. Removing the worn Remnants from the host (even forcefully) fails to destroy or dispel the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]].

The spirit's appearance is that of a huge, muscular lich made of spectral miasma. Depending on the Remnants that the hosted creature has attuned to, the spirit's appearance may change to reflect the host's Remnants. Regardless of appearance, the spirit's abilities and power are unchanged.

#### Victory or Defeat

If the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]] is defeated, the host creature gains four levels of exhaustion. In addition, all Remnants of Dendallen on the current plane of existence, even those not attuned to by the host, turn to mush and are destroyed as the magic that anchored Dendallen's spirit is dispelled. All of the Remnants' effects and curses that were affecting the creature end.

If the spirit is victorious in combat and maintains its control over the host, it can spend 1 minute solidifying its ownership and possess the host. Once the creature is fully possessed in this way, the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]] can stay within the creature's body and command it indefinitely. The host creature shows no outward signs of the possessing spirit. While possessed in this way, the host automatically fails all saving throws against the spirit's thrall.

While Dendallen is proud of his necromantic achievements, his step into undeath is a shameful setback. He will do whatever it takes to remain within the possessed creature and maintain his sense of life unless absolutely necessary. The spirit can reemerge from the possessed creature as an action. When this happens, the possessed creature can resume attempting saving throws to maintain its free will, but they suffer disadvantage on each of these attempts. Use the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]]'s stat block and the possessed creature's statistics for these saving throws.

> [!note] Variant: Limited Host Spellcasting
> 
> At your discretion, The Spirit of Dendallen's host gains the following trait for as long as they remain under its thrall.
> 
> **Adopted Spellcasting.** A creature possessed by the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Spirit Of Dendallen (TGS1).md\|Spirit of Dendallen]] that has spell slots immediately forgets all spells they know and have prepared, which are then replaced by the list of spells that the spirit knows for itself. The spirit's host retains its normal spell slots, but can only use those spell slots to cast spells in their new adopted spell list. If the spirit's host is not a wizard, they can nonetheless cast its spells as if they were spells in the host's class spell list, using its spellcasting ability modifier and spell save DC. If the spirit is destroyed, its host forgets all of the spirit's spells, remembers all of their previous spells, and can (if applicable) spend time preparing spells as normal.
> 
> *This option is good for when wizards or other powerful spellcasters become the subject of the spirit's control. Given that player character balance is different than creature balance, some spells are disproportionately good for killing fellow players. If you're concerned about the spellcaster turning on its friends and casting* [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] *with a 6th level spell slot, this option may be right for your game.*
