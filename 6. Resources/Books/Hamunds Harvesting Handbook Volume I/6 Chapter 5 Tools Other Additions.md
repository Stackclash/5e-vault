# Chapter 5: Tools & Other Additions
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I, p. 145* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund

> Harvesting is a holistic art. It is not simply the physical act of cutting and slicing through a carcass, it is the tools you use, the rules you live by and the skills you have; in short it is an entire lifestyle! Once you have assumed the life of a harvester, you will see the world in a different way, and find the new possibilities and options open to you. However, in the case that you haven't, I've listed them down here for you anyway.

This guide introduces a few new concepts into the base game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and as part of that, a few slight alterations and/or additions need to be made to existing concepts and features in the game to accommodate them. While some of these changes are not strictly necessary for this guide to be used, they are advised in order to get the maximum value out of this book.

## Special Tools

A few new pieces of adventuring gear have been added in this book to accommodate the act of harvesting. Their functions are described below:

## Additions and Changes

The following are a few balance changes to accommodate the harvesting and crafting rules in this guide, as well as a background and feat to incorporate harvesting into your game.

### New Background: Harvester

Like a miner in their cave or a farmer in their field, you too make your living through reaping the riches of the natural world. Your resources, however, are the monsters and creatures that populate the multiverse. Although there are some who would scoff and call you a mere butcher, you understand the subtle complexities in the fantastical anatomies you find in your adventures, and only you are qualified enough to harvest them.

## Hamund's Helpers

> Throughout my travels I have met many spectacular individuals. Among them are master crafters, each peculiar in their own ways, but all of them capable of weaving miracles from materials. I know not where these remarkable people are today, perhaps they have finally settled down somewhere and opened a steady shop. Or they are like me and continue to indulge their wanderlust; roaming freely in this great world of ours while offering their skills to anyone who has the coin and materials. I list their names here in my book, to recommend their services to any of my dear readers. And if you are lucky enough to meet them, simply mention my name and I am sure you will receive first-rate service.

The following are a list of NPC crafters that a DM can easily slot into any campaign or setting. Feel free to use these NPCs as convenient ways for the party to craft their harvested materials into useful items, vendors to buy spare materials, or even quest givers for certain monster parts.

### Alchemist

**Name.** Lidda Littlelid  
**Race.** Halfling  
**Hamund's Notes.** I've known Lidda since she was born, in fact I was even the one who named her (a fact for which she has never forgiven me). Rambunctious as a youth, Lidda regularly came home with frogspawn, gristleweed, milkgrass, and all matters of ingredients to perform her little experiments. Since then, Lidda has grown into a prestigious [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Alchemist.md\|Alchemist]], able to mix even the most esoteric ingredients into some sort of useful brew.  

    Despite being incredibly intelligent, Lidda does have a tendency towards air-headedness. Thus, although she tends to stay in her family home (as most halflings are content to do), Lidda has a tendency to go on walks, become incredibly enthralled by her thoughts and musings, and then find herself hopelessly lost. On these occasions, she can sometimes take upwards of several years before she manages to stumble upon her home again, laden down with new materials to experiment with from her travels.

### Artificer

**Name.** Shareefah Khalid  
**Race.** Human  
**Hamund's Notes.** If you look up the word "prodigy", you will find a picture of Shareefah (either that or a young picture of me). Born to a wealthy family of [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Artificer.md\|artificers]], the young Shareefah received an education from the finest tutors in the land, and routinely dismissed each one when she promptly accelerated beyond what they could teach.  

    Discontent with simply learning the same tired old lessons, Shareefah left her family and her inheritance behind in order to learn everything that the wide multiverse could offer her. She makes her living offering her services to anyone who has an interesting material for her to work with. Those that have met her can attest to her immense prowess in the artificing craft, exemplified perfectly in the portable workshop she designed: an entire hut she can store inside a large ring on her finger.

### Blacksmith

**Name.** Orsik Holderhek  
**Race.** Dwarf  
**Hamund's Notes.** I will admit that the inclusion of Orsik in this book is the result of biases on my part; he is my cousin after all. Despite that however, Orsik has proven himself to be one of our clan's foremost [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Blacksmith.md\|blacksmiths]] (partly due to the steady stream of exotic materials I provide him to experiment with). He is equally as comfortable reforging a broken farm scythe as he is at shaping demon scales into an invincible suit of armor.  

    Holderheks are restless by nature, so it is common for Orsik to leave his forge in search of interesting new locales, stories, and materials. However, wherever he goes, he always brings with him his favourite smithing hammer, a good supply of high-intensity dragon coal, and his prized shrinking anvil (something of his own creation). With these, he is always ready to smith even the rarest of new materials.

### Leatherworker

**Name.** Malakar Uuthrakt  
**Race.** Half-Elf  
**Hamund's Notes.** Malakar's story is a familiar one to many half-elves. The stigma of his mixed heritage caught him between two worlds, unable to find a place in neither elvish nor human societies. Crushed between two poor options, Malakar picked a third: the wild.  

    Living as an outdoorsman, Malakar has proven himself to be a hunter and harvester almost on par with myself. One particular field in which he excels however is tanning and [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Leatherworker.md\|leatherworking]]. Having killed and skinned almost every creature imaginable, Malakar has taught himself how to take the hides of fantastical beasts and mould them into powerful pieces of armor and equipment.  

    His vagrant lifestyle naturally causes him to be found just about anywhere, and it is not uncommon to find him having set up a temporary storefront in a town while he considers his next adventure.

### Thaumaturge

**Name.** "Blind" Mardred  
**Race.** Human (?)  
**Hamund's Notes.** I have known Mardred for a long time, which is saying something considering the longevity of my race, and the relative brevity of hers. Sometimes I do question if she is actually human as she claims, or whether I am simply the mark of a long-running private joke of hers. Even more mysterious than her true age is which divine patron she actually serves. Whenever I have asked her for the identity of her god, she would simply smirk and say, "the only one that matters."  

    Despite everything, I still have found her to be a valuable source of advice, leads, and information. This goes doubly so for her skills as a [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Thaumaturge.md\|Thaumaturge]], able to easily summon forth divine blessings from reams of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|Spirit Paper]], or able to demand servitude from the harvested remains of demons. Mardred tends to wander from town to town, offering her services to any with the coin to pay, her arrival always heralded by the rhythmic tapping of her walking stick.

### Tinker

**Name.** Jarrod Gerkirk  
**Race.** Gnome  
**Hamund's Notes.** If you are going to Jarrod for a spot of conversation, you have gone to the wrong place. On the other hand, if you are going to him for [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Tinker.md\|tinkering work]], then you could not be in better hands. A smarter gnome I have never met, and his inventions are so fantastical that he blurs the line between mechanical and magical.  

    Although Jarrod tends to keep to himself and wiles away the years performing experiments in his laboratory, there are times when he becomes overwhelmed by unexplainable feelings of wanderlust. When these episodes arise, Jarrod inevitably hits the open road on his customised wagon/workshop, ready to make new inventions with whatever fresh materials he finds.

## FAQ

*Q: Why didn't you include the meat you can harvest from creatures?*

A: I wanted to avoid relatively generic harvesting materials. Largely I assumed that DM's would be able to judge meat harvesting by themselves without any need for a guide.

*Q: Can I give suggestions or feedback?*

A: Of course! This is a living document and I fully endorse anyone to send in item suggestions or balance feedback. See the Contact Us section for contact details.

*Q: Can I change an item to suit my campaign?*

A: Feel free to do so. Items were designed to be setting agnostic and able to fit into anything, but edge cases could always occur. I encourage DMs to use this guide as a launching point for their own ideas.

*Q: Will you be making a follow-up for "Volo's Guide to Monsters" and "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes"?*

A: Yes I will. Stay tuned for updates on those.

> See Hamund's Harvesting Handbook II ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook II.json] & Hamund's Harvesting Handbook III ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook III.json] Soon... ^[This is a homebrew addition]

*Q: How do your rules fit in with the newly released Artificer class on Unearthed Arcana?*

A: To be honest, they do not. The updated Artificer class was released very late into the development of this guide and as such, this guide does not incorporate them at all. A future update may attempt to reconcile them.

*Q: Why don't you include the beast section?*

A: I felt that beasts were too mundane to include in the harvest table, and largely could be replaced by a DM googling an actual butcher table.

*Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armor?*

A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Hobgoblin.md\|Hobgoblin]] walks around with a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spear]] at all times, so I felt best to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context.
