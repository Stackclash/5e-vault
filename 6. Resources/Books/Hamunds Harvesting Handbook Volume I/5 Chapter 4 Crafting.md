# Chapter 4: Crafting
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I, p. 113* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> It was our long distant ancestors that first discovered how to transform the bones of a fresh kill into a heavy club with which to make more fresh kills. Today of course, we have the wonders of civilisation, and with that comes a litany of more advanced tools, weapons, armor, and equipment to be made from what we kill. Indeed, the resourcefulness of society means that just about every creature's carcass can serve as more than just a trophy if you take it to someone with the right know-how.

## Crafting Rules

While some creature parts are useful fresh from the carcass, many require some alterations before their full potential can be realised. These items can be identified due to having a **craftable item** listed in their crafting column. As crafting is a very natural complement to harvesting, an entire chapter has been devoted to its rules here.

### Crafters

In order to craft a harvested item into a usable item, it must be worked on by a skilled **crafter**. Crafters are specialised professionals with the knowledge to turn raw materials into something usable. Crafters also tend to be of a certain type, covering different types of items to be made (see "Crafter Types" below).

Both player characters and NPCs may act as crafters, so long as they fulfil the stipulated requirements for their crafter type.

Crafters also need to have the right equipment and tools in order to craft an item, however that aspect is left up to the discretion of the DM and the suitability of the setting. In more fantastical campaigns, magical forges and laboratories may line every city bazaar, while in more grounded settings, finding appropriate facilities may be a quest in and of itself.

### Materials, Time, and Cost

Each craftable item listed in this guide requires at least one harvestable material from a monster's harvesting table to act as a **base component** of the item. This base component provides the driving magical force that allows the item to function. The harvesting material and quantity of the materials required are listed in the description of the craftable item. For some craftable items, there are several potential harvestable materials that may act as the base component. In these cases, any of the listed materials may be used.

Craftable items require more than just the base component provided by harvested materials, however. Crafting an item requires a cost covering other requirements such as tools, facilities, and extra materials. Note that this cost does NOT include the cost of actually hiring a crafter, and that such a cost is considered separate. Assuming that the players are providing the base component for a craftable material, the value of this base component can be deducted from the end cost of crafting the item.

Finally, craftable items take a certain amount of time before they can be completed. The breakdown of the time and cost investment to craft an item is listed in the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Magic Item Crafting Time And Cost.md\|Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost]] table on the next page ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: below].

This guide uses the rules for crafting in "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" as the basis for the crafting rules presented here. DM's are encouraged to adjust these numbers based on the needs of their own games.

### Crafter Type

You don't ask a blacksmith to cut the timbers of your house, and you don't ask an alchemist to craft you a suit of armor. If you want an item crafted, you need the right person for the job. Each craftable item comes with a tag in brackets explaining which type of crafter is capable of making that item.

Crafters are not restricted to a single profession either. Some skills are complimentary, or certain individuals are simply talented enough to cover multiple fields. Unless otherwise stated, crafters with multiple proficiencies use the same score for each field.

The following is a basic rundown of crafter types:

> [!embed-optionalfeature]- Thaumaturge
> ![[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Thaumaturge.md\|Thaumaturge]]

### Crafting Items from Published Books

Some craftable items originate from official source books published by Wizards of the Coast. In order to avoid lifting large sections of their book and reproducing them here, you are encouraged to look them up in their original books. The source book has been tagged next to the craftable item's name: DMG for Dungeon Master's Guide, and XGTE for Xanathar's Guide to Everything. ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: The source items have been tagged.]

In order to understand the quantities of harvestable materials required and the type of crafter, the following table has been made:

## Craftable Items A-Z

Craftable items are presented in alphabetical order. A craftable item's description gives the item's name, its category, its rarity, its base component, the crafter type required to make it, and its magical properties.
