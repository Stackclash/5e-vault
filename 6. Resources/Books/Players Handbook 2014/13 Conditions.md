# Conditions
*Source: Player's Handbook (2014), p. 289* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]], are impairments, but a few, such as [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]]  - [[/5.
