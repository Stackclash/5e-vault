# Spell Lists
*Source: Deep Magic, p. 6*

The spells in *Deep Magic for 5th Edition* are all listed here, and the great majority of the spells listed are found in the spell descriptions detailed in the section after this one. A spell whose entry in the lists ends with a term in brackets (such as [chaos] or [dragon] or [Void]) is found in a separate section devoted to that category and its traditions and quirks.

A spell whose entry ends with "[clockwork]" is an example of clockwork magic, which is an integral part of the Midgard Campaign Setting. The "appendix" of this book presents clockwork magic spell lists for each class capable of using such magic.

Similarly, a spell whose entry ends with "[labyrinth]" belongs to a small group of rare spells collectively known as labyrinth magic. The "appendix" presents labyrinth magic spell lists for each class capable of using such magic.
