# Clockwork Magic
*Source: Deep Magic, p. 301* 

Clockwork magic is a style of magic from the Midgard Campaign Setting, divinely granted to humans and dwarves by the goddess Rava, patron of industry and mistress of time.

If you play in Midgard, or if you want to add clockwork magic to your game, this category of magic includes several temporal magic spells and some of the spells described earlier in this book. For additional, specific spells to heal or control clockworks, see the *Midgard Heroes Handbook*.

## Clockwork Familiars

A wizard who embraces clockwork magic can use the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell in a special way. A small clockwork device in the form of an animal (worth 10 gp) is substituted for the spell's usual material component. The device must resemble one of the allowable animals listed in the spell. When the casting is complete, the clockwork animates. It has the statistics of the chosen animal form, but is a construct, rather than a beast.

A clockwork familiar's form can be changed by rebuilding the clockwork device into a new form of animal and casting the spell again. If the familiar is destroyed, it can be rebuilt (in the same form or a new one) with the same components, if they are recovered; otherwise, 10 gp must be spent on replacement parts.

## Clockwork Magic Spell Lists

All spellcasters can cast some number of clockwork spells, as borne out in the lists that follow. The spells in these lists that carry a "[temporal]" tag can be found in the "Temporal Magic" section. Other spells appear either earlier in this book or in the standard rules.
