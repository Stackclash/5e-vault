For countless ages the heat of the deserts and shifting sands of these lands have held many secrets that fascinate, delight, and terrify. Ancient knowledge can be found here by those who know how and where to look, unlocking a new world of power and possibility. But bewareâ€”this knowledge is difficult to learn and dangerous to the unschooled! Few of its masters are willing to teach their secrets to anyone outside their own sect. But perhaps as an astute linguist, a talented artist, or even a clever mason, you can tap into the secret script of magic from ancient times and unlock the power of hieroglyphs.

Accessing the magic of hieroglyphs requires the [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Carver (KPDM).md\|Script Carver]] and [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Sage (KPDM).md\|Script Sage]] feats. If the option to gain feats isn't used in your campaign, then [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Carver (KPDM).md\|Script Carver]] and [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Sage (KPDM).md\|Script Sage]] can be gained in place of level-based ability score improvement, if your GM approves. Alternatively, characters might need to accomplish other, story-related tasks determined by the GM to gain the abilities bestowed by the [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Carver (KPDM).md\|Script Carver]] and [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Sage (KPDM).md\|Script Sage]] feats. Once any obstacles are cleared, all characters who meet the prerequisites can gain these feats.

## Invoking Heiroglyph Powers

Invoking one of a hieroglyph's powers requires an action and provokes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attacks]]. Generally, you must either draw a physical representation of the glyph (in paint, in blood, in the dirt or snow, and so forth) or trace the shape of an existing carving of the glyph that was created to an exacting standard.

Each hieroglyph confers a benefit on someone who knows how to scribe it. A hieroglyph's benefit is always in effect for a character who knows that hieroglyph. In addition, that character can call upon one of the hieroglyph's powers when so desired. Unless otherwise noted, all hieroglyph powers can be used once, and that expended use is regained when you finish a long rest.

Some powers have a level requirement (given in parentheses); when a character attains that level, this power becomes an additional choice. Mastery powers are a separate category: only a character who has the [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Sage (KPDM).md\|Script Sage]] feat for a particular hieroglyph can use its mastery power. If a power or a mastery power has no level requirement, it becomes available to you as soon as you acquire the necessary feat.

If a hieroglyph power gives you the ability to cast a spell, you can do so without needing any components (aside from materials needed for the drawing of the glyph), and the spell is always cast as if using the lowest-level spell slot possible. It typically has the same duration as a normal casting of the spell, and uses your character level as the caster level.

When a hieroglyph power calls for a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your ability bonus + your proficiency bonus. The ability that applies to the DC calculation is the same as the ability used for the saving throw.
