The brooding archmage alone in his tower is a staple of fantasy literature. The more powerful the wizard becomes, the more distant he or she seems from the common folk, and the greatest wizards are often the most misunderstood or feared. Some wizards try to alleviate this loneliness by passing on their knowledge to those around them, taking on one or more apprentices. Others create magic constructs to guard their homes—or simply to keep them company—and wizards summon familiars for much the same reason.

This section describes various companions and accoutrements that a powerful spellcaster, particularly a wizard, might have. These creatures and features help to flesh out a wizard's home and are often encountered in the wizard's stead. Finally, they provide opportunities for adventure, either independent of the wizard or linked to the spellcaster.

## Apprentices

Every archmage needs someone to clean dishes, tend to meals, and wash bedpans. Although some wizards use spells or servants to perform these duties, others give these jobs to their apprentices, budding wizards they have taken under their wings to learn the esteemed art of magic. Many wizards also rely on their apprentices to deal with the riffraff who wander into their towers looking for help; for many player characters, the wizard's apprentice is their first point of contact.

Below are presented five apprentices that can be inserted into a new or ongoing campaign. These apprentices are more than just collections of numbers; each has his or her own history and motivations that can impact the lives of the characters who deal with them.

### Lereilel Cloudwood

> [!quote]  
> 
> Magic never judges you based on your appearance. It doesn't care if you are fat or thin, if you are beautiful or ugly. Magic accepts you the way you are.

Lereilel Cloudwood (NG female human 2nd-level wizard) is a young woman in her early twenties with dark reddish-brown hair, pale green eyes, and numerous freckles. Overweight and lacking confidence, Lereilel has always been anxious about her appearance and is frequently tongue-tied, particularly when dealing with members of the opposite sex. She has a real passion for magic, however, and was taken in as an apprentice by Ravin Wyrdstone (LN male human 16th-level wizard [transmuter]), who has great faith in Lereilel's abilities.

#### Background

Lereilel was born into an affluent family and displayed an affinity for magic when she came of age—much to the chagrin of her socialite mother, who constantly expressed her disappointment that Lereilel had taken after her father's looks and whims. Although she was discouraged by her mother's disapproval and the mirthful stares of the men her mother brought to woo her, Lereilel eventually convinced her father to let her study magic under the tutelage of Ravin Wyrdstone. Since then, Lereilel has worked hard to prove herself but still thinks that her appearance holds her back. She has faith that the transmutation magic she is studying might hold the key to "correcting" her unsightly looks and finally make her mother proud of her.

Recently, Lereilel has been seeing Thaliydor Brightcrest, a handsome half-elf and a local carpenter who seems to think the world of her despite her homeliness. Unfortunately for her, Lereilel does not realize she is being duped and that Thaliydor is actually an assassin (CE male half-elf 5th-level rogue) who is using her to get closer to her master.

#### Personality

Loreilel is highly intelligent and well versed in arcane lore, but finds it difficult to speak with people and has been something of a wallflower throughout her life. As such, she can easily be taken advantage of by someone who gives her any attention, particularly if that person is both attractive and charming. If Lereilel realizes that Thaliydor's feelings are false, the last shreds of her confidence might finally break, leading her to do something potentially self-destructive unless someone steps in to save her.

#### Plot Hook

One easy way for the characters to become involved with Lereilel is to have them hired by her master as guards. Ravin is concerned that he might be the target of an assassination attempt by an old enemy and wants the characters to protect him and his apprentice until he can track down the villain. Strangely, the archmage is more concerned about Lereilel than he is about himself and tells the characters to watch her carefully. Alternatively, they could be hired by Lereilel's father to check on his daughter and see how she is doing. Regardless of how the characters become involved, their arrival puts a major chink in Thaliydor's plans and forces the assassin's hand, as the half-elf hires a band of evil brigands to deal with the characters while he uses Lereilel as bait to make an attempt on the life of her master.

### Terindor Grayveil

> [!quote]  
> 
> Ever since my sister was forced to marry that horrible noble, I've been looking for a way to free her. You lot might be just the heroes I need.

Terindor Grayveil (CG male human 1st-level wizard) is a wiry lad of fifteen with unruly orange hair and deep blue eyes. An earnest and helpful soul, Terindor is also far smarter than most of the adults around him and has taken to the study of magic with natural aplomb. His master is Elgretta Mathelzor (LG female human 14th-level wizard [evoker]), a famous war wizard who is often away on military campaigns, leaving Terindor to fend for himself.

#### Background

Terindor was born to hard-working but luckless mercantile parents who gave everything they had to make the lives of their children better, even teaching them letters and history to help them establish themselves in the world. The family became crippled by debt, and rather than seeing her parents cast out onto the streets, Terindor's sister, Ileena, agreed to marry a lecherous noble in order to save the family business. Shortly thereafter, Terindor sought out the war wizard and begged to become her apprentice—a move that shocked his mother and father, even more so when Elgretta agreed. Since then, Terindor has worked hard at his training, moving forward in leaps and bounds even though his master is frequently absent.

#### Personality

Terindor is a determined lad who consistently pushes himself to become a better wizard. While maintaining this focus, he frequently pauses his studies to help out those in need, whether by fixing the roof of a spinster's cottage or driving out giant rats from the local brewery. Well-liked by those in his community, he is also the only one not awestruck by his mistress, who is renowned for her success in singlehandedly destroying a horde of goblins and felling a mighty white dragon with a barrage of spells.

Terindor's main reason for wanting to become stronger is to free Ileena from her forced marriage. Although he knows that Elgretta sympathizes with him, she has told him quite bluntly that seeking retribution against the noble is wrong and not something she can be part of.

#### Plot Hook

While he is training, Terindor keeps his ear to the ground in the community for talk of passing adventurers, particularly those who don't care about breaking the rules but are still fundamentally good at heart. If he hears of the characters' deeds, he approaches them at his first opportunity and expresses his desire to help his sister out of her predicament. Terindor has nothing to give the characters in payment but promises to help them enchant their gear when he becomes a more powerful wizard. If the characters seem about to refuse his request, he offers them the services of Elgretta—a promise that he knows might cause him a lot of trouble in the future.

### Erolimar

> [!quote]  
> 
> Master Taramind took me on as his apprentice even though there were more suitable candidates. I'll be forever grateful to him.

Erolimar (LG male elf 1st-level wizard) is a young elf with sweeping silvery locks and amethyst eyes. Stout of limb, graceful and handsome, Erolimar seems almost like the perfect elf—yet despite these qualities, he has been cursed with only middling intelligence and wisdom, making him a poor choice as a wizard's apprentice. Nevertheless, he has been taken on by Taramind the Scorched (NE elf male 15th-level wizard [conjurer]), a mysterious elf with hideously burned features who is known for his dealings with elementals and fiends.

#### Background

Erolimar comes from a long line of accomplished spellcasters. Indeed, it was expected that young Erolimar would enroll at an esteemed college of magic when he came of age so he could follow in his forebears' footsteps. This would have been the case, had he passed the entrance exam. Soon, it became clear that Erolimar was not the paragon of wizardry his father and mother thought he would be. Dejected, he turned his back on magic to pursue the meaningful but far less prestigious role of hunter for his village.

Just when it seemed that magic had left Erolimar behind, he was saved by Taramind, who approached the young elf to be his apprentice. At first fearful of the wizard's reputation, Erolimar finally accepted the offer and has taken to his new position with gusto, unaware that his master has taken him on to prepare Erolimar's soul for sacrifice to a fiend, whose life force he will then transfer into the young elf 's body.

#### Personality

Erolimar is a kind-hearted, generous, and naive individual who does not see a bad bone in anyone around him. Even Taramind, with his menacing demeanor and harsh teaching methods, does not set off Erolimar's alarm bells; he prefers to focus on his master's strengths, rather than than worry about his flaws. Erolimar is envied by many in his village for his good looks and natural agility, but they are also aware of his failings, and there are few who can hold a bad thought in their hearts for the elf for too long.

#### Plot Hook

The characters are hired by the local elf population to investigate a spate of bizarre animal attacks in the vicinity of Taramind's mansion. The attacks have been violent and erratic, the animals in question extremely vicious and difficult to kill. During their investigation, the characters run into Erolimar, and the elf proves to be helpful on more than one occasion. Eventually (perhaps with Erolimar's help), they realize that the animals have become possessed by lesser fiends and that some sort of conjuration magic is responsible. It is at this point when Taramind begins to prepare the young elf for sacrifice, and it is up to the characters to save him. How this plays out is up to the GM, but Taramind is no pushover—his mansion is home to magic traps, bound fiends, and terrible golems.

### Arn if Rowan

> [!quote]  
> 
> I was a warrior before I became a wizard, a sword for hire who traveled the world looking for adventure. I made a name for myself as well. Perhaps you've heard of me? Arn's the name—Arn of Rowan.

Arn of Rowan (CN male human 12th-level fighter/2nd-level wizard) is a strapping man in his mid-thirties with long brown hair, a thick beard, and piercing black eyes. Tall and full of vigor, Arn seems like an odd choice for a wizard's apprentice, and his master, Jainara Meadowwands (LN female human 9th-level wizard [illusionist]), seems more like a harried wife than a teacher. Indeed, most people find their pairing to be odd, especially given that Arn is much more famous than his master.

#### Background

Arn began his career as a soldier in the army of a self-righteous duke who waged war against his neighbors under the pretense of dispensing justice. It was during this bloody time that Arn solidified his reputation as a vicious fighter with axe and shield, and once the duke had his fill of warfare, Arn forged his own career as a mercenary for hire, basing himself in the small town of Rowan, which he soon put on the map with his legendary exploits.

It was after one particularly harrowing mission that Arn drank too much ale at the local tavern and lost a bet to one of his companions, a bard who claimed that Arn could never master any trade but that of the blade. Haughtily, Arn took up the challenge and availed himself of the talents of Jainara Meadowwands, a mousy-haired woman and capable illusionist, agreeing to pay off her debts in exchange for becoming her pupil. Jainara accepted the deal, believing that Arn would quickly grow bored and leave—but much to her amazement, he not only stayed but quickly excelled as her student.

#### Personality

Arn is a boisterous and carefree individual who has many scars and tales from his past. Naturally charismatic and with an unusually keen intellect, he would probably have been a lord by now if it were not for his chaotic nature. The fact that he is good at magecraft does not surprise Arn, since he is good at whatever he puts his mind to. What does surprise him, however, is that he actually enjoys the work. He has also grown quite fond of Jainara, and finds her presence strangely calming.

#### Plot Hook

The characters are passing through the area when Rowan is attacked by a flight of wyvern-riding hobgoblins. Arn and Jainara are also present, and through their combined efforts they and the characters manage to turn back the attack. Jainara is injured during the fight, and it is at this stage that Arn decides to turn his back on the blade and try being a wizard full-time. Of course, being Arn of Rowan, he cannot let the culprits get away with hurting his master, so he offers the PCs his magic battleaxe if they track the hobgoblins back to their base and finish them off.

### Xelasora

> [!quote]  
> 
> Master Dramothir will be with you shortly. Just be sure to mind your manners and don't put any dirt on the furniture.

Xelasora (LN female dragonborn 1st-level sorcerer/1st-level wizard) is a graceful dragonborn in her late teens with mottled blue and green scales, four short horns that sweep back from her brow, and large amber eyes. She also has a large, reddish birthmark on her left shoulder that she normally keeps hidden under her robes. Xelasora is serious and humble and possesses a razor-sharp mind. Her master is Dramothir Galefnir (LG male dwarf 12th-level wizard [abjurer]), who in addition to being a learned mage is also a renowned artisan and jeweler.

#### Background

The youngest of seven siblings, Xelasora lived a happy childhood, until the disastrous day when a red dragon attacked her community and killed the rest of her family. Mentally and emotionally scarred by the experience, Xelasora withdrew into herself after she was placed in an orphanage. She was ostracized by the other children in the orphanage, who were mostly human and considered her little more than a monster. Eventually, her pent-up emotions boiled over and she unleashed some of her latent magic, setting fire to the clothing of one of her tormentors. This act led to her being expelled from the orphanage and forced to live on the streets, where she barely managed to stay alive by using her powers. Finally, when all hope seemed lost, Xelasora was taken in by the mage Dramothir, a dwarf who was intrigued by her intelligence and wit, and who was a natural sucker for a damsel in distress. Since then, Xelasora has done her best to be a dutiful apprentice and astutely handles Dramothir's busy schedule.

#### Personality

Xelasora is the best student that any wizard could hope for. She pursues both her magical studies and her mundane duties with the same rigorous attention to detail and is faultless in her execution. Her poised exterior, however, conceals a tormented soul. She constantly doubts herself and is worried that she could lose control of her sorcerous abilities if she becomes flustered or upset. The deaths of her family and the trouble she faced at the orphanage also still weigh on her heavily, and lately she has been plagued with dreams of fire and shadowy flying shapes, causing her to suddenly awaken in terror.

#### Plot Hook

Xelasora's magic comes from a bit of theft: in her younger days, she stole a set of scrolls from an ancient red dragon. The dragon still exists in the form of a terrible undead monstrosity, and it shares a strange link with the young dragonborn that allows the two of them to share dreams and images of their lives. By the time the characters enter the picture, the dragon is close to discovering Xelasora's location—and when it does so, it plans to slay her and recover its scrolls. Before this event comes to pass, the characters have a chance to stop it, either by destroying the dragon or somehow trapping it. Of course, defeating an undead dragon is no easy feat; depending on the characters' level, the GM might want to lead them up to the event with battles against the dragon's servants in the form of ghouls, trolls, vampires, and lesser evil dragons.

## Magic Constructs

Golems and similar constructs are common features in a wizard's home. The most powerful mages have access to even more dangerous and complex automatons. Although golems are the most common of these constructs, they seldom have any individuality or personality, making them little more than defensive window-dressing.

Described below are several unique magic constructs, each with its own history and personality. Some of them are presented along with ready-made adventure scenarios.

- [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Construct/Bzeldruins Hundred (KPDM).md\|Bzeldruin's Hundred]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Construct/Leothars Bust (KPDM).md\|Leothar's Bust]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Construct/Nisruels Coachfly (KPDM).md\|Nisruel's Coachfly]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Construct/Sivvars Writing Desk (KPDM).md\|Sivvar's Writing Desk]]  

## Oddities for Every Occasion

From wands that shoot out darts of force and potions that allow you to breathe underwater to magic airships and iron barrels that turn into crabs, wizards are behind the creation of most of the magic items found in a standard fantasy setting. Yet not every magic item is as generally useful or powerful as those mentioned above. Some of the magic items found in a wizard's laboratory or workshop fill a niche role, are the results of failed experiments, function as normal magic items but have a different appearance, or are just plain bizarre.

While characters explore a wizard's tower or stronghold, an adventurer might come across a variety of strange magic items, some of which are more helpful than others. To determine what a character finds while searching, roll on the table below or choose one or more items at your discretion.

> ![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Oddities For Every Occasion (KPDM).md\|Oddities for Every Occasion]]

## Familiar Territory

Although the list of available familiars in the standard rules is sufficient for most campaigns, some players and GMs might enjoy using an unusual creature that has features not found in other familiars.

To determine what familiar an NPC spellcaster might have, the GM can roll on one of the tables in this section or select a creature. Players can also use these tables to choose familiars for their characters, with the GM's approval. (Of course, any creature that can be a familiar must also exist in the world on its own.)

The familiars presented here are of two basic kinds: standard familiars, which function the same as other beasts that serve the caster of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell, and variant familiars, each of which is an intelligent creature that offers a special benefit to its master.

### Common Traits

As stated in the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell, each of these creatures gains the celestial, fey, or fiend type (spellcaster's choice) when it becomes a familiar. Also, as noted in the spell, a familiar can't attack (though it can deliver a touch spell on behalf of its master). The stat blocks in this section include information on attacks, because it might come into play if any of these creatures are encountered as monsters in their own right, or perhaps as allies of the player characters.

### Standard Familiars

With the GM's consent, any of the beasts described in this section can be chosen by a character who casts the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell. These creatures might also be encountered as the familiars of NPC spellcasters.

> [!embed-table]- Standard Familiars
> ![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Standard Familiars (KPDM).md\|Standard Familiars]]

### Variant Familiars

This section expands the roster of potential  amiliars to include several intelligent creatures with supernatural abilities. The relationship between the familiar and its master, and the benefits the master receives, resembles how the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Imp.md\|imp]], the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Quasit.md\|quasit]], and the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Pseudodragon.md\|pseudodragon]] are presented as variant familiars in the standard rules.

If the GM allows the use of any of these variant familiars by player characters, it might or might not be necessary for the would-be master to start the process by casting [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]]. Either way, a variant familiar is an actual creature (not a spirit) that serves at its own discretion, obeying its master's commands only when doing so does not immediately bring it harm, and it will not hesitate to end the link with its master as a matter of self-preservation. Unlike standard familiars, a variant familiar does not disappear if it drops to 0 hit points; it simply dies or falls unconscious (GM's choice).
