Dwarves are renowned as shapers of the physical world. Earth, stone, and metal bend to the will of dwarven hammers. It's easy to assume that because dwarves have such great skill at shaping material, they must lack the time and energy to become masters of the arcane, tooâ€”but that assumption is wrong. Taking unformed matter and shaping it to conform to one's will is an effective way of blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves' greatest magic has come from this effort, as evidenced by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of war that emerge from their mountain strongholds. Few dwarves pursue the study of magic aside from devotion to their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between creation and spellcasting: ring magic.

Ring magic is the dwarven art of forging metal into rings, often with runes inscribed on their surface, and using those rings to produce or bring about magical effects. Dedicated practitioners known as [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard Ring Warden (KPDM).md\|ring wardens]] channel their magic through specially prepared rings, increasing the devastation wreaked upon their foes, and they can even imbue spells into rings that they or someone else can unleash later.

Rings created for the purpose of invoking ring magic are more than decorative hand jewelry. They often take the form of circlets of precious metal large enough to adorn a weapon, a staff, or a suit of armor. Wizards who devote themselves to ring magic are rare outside the dwarves' lands, but they're instantly recognizable by the ring-adorned stafffs they carry.

Although ring magic spells often require a ring of some form as a material component, the effects they produce are quite distinct and variable, from illusions to transmutations and evocations. What they have in common is that dwarves have uncovered a way to bind the effects into rings; the deeper arcane connection between the rings and the spells is sometimes elusive.
