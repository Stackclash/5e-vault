## Arcane Backgrounds

Many people come of age after being exposed to some form of arcane magic, or after being attracted to the study of supernatural forces. The arcane backgrounds presented below are examples of how to expand the concept, all designed to give players a wider range of choices when fleshing out their characters if the GM allows this material into the campaign. Optionally, the GM can use these backgrounds to add depth and complexity to NPCs that the player characters will come up against.
