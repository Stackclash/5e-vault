My first spell-slinger was a cleric of Thor who was more about crushing the enemy than healing the wounded. Choosing which spells he would be able to cast was a thrill from the very beginning. Plus, announcing each spell with a shout of praise for thunder and lightning felt, well, extremely metal. I was 12, and casting spells was the best part of playing D&D.

Not that much has changed. This *Deep Magic* collection offers more than 700 new spells for your character or

your campaign's NPCs to enhance the richness of your adventures. That's 700 new ways to explore, explode, manipulate, disintegrate, and master the fantasy campaign of your choice. When you add in the subclasses, domains, and appendices, you'll see that this collection broadens the scope of what spells can accomplish. If you enjoy magic in its endless variety, this book is a treasure trove of possibilities.

The *Deep Magic* series for 5th Edition started in 2016 and has expanded to twenty-some installments since then; these are updated, revised, and collected here together with almost 200 all-new spells, plus material collected from the Warlock Patreon booklets, Tales of the Old Margreve, Empire of the Ghouls, and other sources. Topped off by the best spells submitted by Kickstarter backers, this volume offers you a rich collection of particular styles of magic as well as everyday, highly useful spells for any caster. In its wide-ranging approach, it also includes spells designed expressly for villains and variations on three traditional spells dating from the earliest days of the game.

This book will inspire you, spark encounters and nefarious plots, and give your hero new tools to outsmart and outfight the monstrous foes that await in any dungeon. This volume enables all that and more.

Go forth and make magic!
