# Dark Magic
*Source: Deep Magic, p. 306* 

This appendix is intended primarily for the GM's use in equipping villains and other NPCs with particularly vile or dangerous sorts of magic. Although it is possible that some of these spells will find their way into the hands of spellcasting player characters, most good-aligned characters might (understandably) have doubts about using magic fueled by bloodletting, the forces of the Void, or the Elder Gods. How far the GM allows player characters to progress along this dark path is an individual decision, but it should be clear from the nature of the material that anyone who uses these purely maleficent forms of magic must be prepared to accept the unpleasant and sometimes debilitating consequences.

## Apocalypse Magic

The tradition of apocalypse magic is one road that evil wizards and other arcane casters can follow to power. It also leads clerics and prophets into the service of ambitious, destructive deities.

Entropy is sometimes seen as synonymous with death and the end of days. In truth, it's a facet of nature as inescapable as the four elements and the laws of alchemy. Doomsday cults relish the approaching apocalypse, espousing love while threatening damnation for unbelievers; kings and lords threaten to tear down all of civilization just to add a new province to their realms.

Apocalypse magic isn't widely practiced, because of its inherent destructiveness. At the same time, practitioners can be found in a vast variety of situations. Devotees of dark lords, emissaries of hostile interplanar beings, leaders of vicious cults, and a host of other villainous threats might be workers of apocalypse magic.

When and where this branch of magic originated is unknown. Some scholars see it as the ultimate expression of natural law, while others consider it a divine gift or the manifestation of a chaotic deity's will. Whatever its source, apocaplyse magic's potential to harm, weaken, terrify, and empower makes it one of the most dangerous magical arts.

### Apocalypse Magic Spell Lists

All spellcasting classes except for the [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Ranger.md\|ranger]] have access to certain kinds of apocalypse magic, as shown in the following lists.

## Blood Magic

Blood is life, and blood magic is closely tied to the dark gods, blood sacrifices, and malevolent casters. Typically, this style of magic is found among vengeful [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Druid.md\|druids]], dark magical societies, cultists of forbidden gods, and lone arcane practitioners with a wanton disregard for others.

### Blood Magic Spell Lists

As might be expected, [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Sorcerer.md\|sorcerers]] and [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|wizards]] have the largest repertoires of blood spells. At the other end of the spectrum are [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Druid.md\|druids]] and [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Ranger.md\|rangers]], who have only a small amount of such magic.

## Fiendish Magic

Any mortal in the world can be evil by choice, or can be forced into performing evil acts. The same cannot be said for certain denizens of other planes, particularly demons and devils. These fiends are not only innately evil—no choice about it for them, no forcing needed—but also the very personification of evil.

Some spellcasters take up the practice of a certain kind of magic that enables them to emulate or interact with those fiends, or to protect themselves from being annihlated by the evil creatures they revere. The largest repertoire of fiendish magic belongs to evil [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|wizards]], but like-minded [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Cleric.md\|clerics]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Sorcerer.md\|sorcerers]], and [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md\|warlocks]] can also traffic in these spells.

## Void Magic

Void magic comprises a dangerous offshoot of wizardry that exists in the shadows of the more well-known practices. This form of magic is anathema to existence itself, making it difficult to master and dangerous even to study. Dabblers rarely produce effects more profound than minor injury, property damage, and psychological scars to themselves and those around them. More serious investigations into Void magic can spell disaster. Only alien creatures whose psychology and physiology defy human understanding seem capable of commanding Void magic with relative ease; even beings as anomalous as aboleths respect and fear the power of Void magic.

A Void spell can never be added to a [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|wizard's]] spellbook as one of the two free spells obtained for gaining a level. To learn a Void magic spell, a [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|wizard]] must find an NPC who is willing to impart the knowledge, or else discover the spell written on a scroll, in a captured spellbook, or carved on a temple wall, or find it in some other form of recorded lore. Alternatively, if the GM allows it, a character who sees and hears a Void magic spell being cast can add it to his or her spellbook, using the same rules as for transcribing a spell from a scroll.

Despite the unique origin of Void magic, it still functions similarly to other arcane magic on a fundamental level. Void magic follows all the normal rules for spellcasting and is susceptible to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispelling]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Counterspell.md\|counterspelling]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Antimagic Field.md\|antimagic]] as normal.

### Void Speech

Every Void spell has a verbal component—an utterance in the dark syllables of Void Speech—and can't, under any circumstances, be cast by someone who cannot speak it. The written form of Void Speech is used to create Void glyphs, which are involved in the casting of some Void spells.

### Void Magic Spell Lists

Void magic as a practice and form is entirely the province of [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|wizards]]. [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md\|Warlocks]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Bard.md\|bards]], and other casters seem unable to master the complex language and arcana associated with it, which demands intense focus and study.

### Touch of the Void

The Void exists outside the realm of sanity and form. Creatures spawned by unknown powers and processes exist there, constantly seeking entry into the living, physical world. More than that, the Void itself seems almost alive, or at least under some constant pressure to spread and expand—to consume. Creatures who taste its power expose themselves to its touch, and that touch is corruptive. It bears a taint that seeps into physical, spiritual, and mental being.

Void magic is powerful and often destructive, its spells reinforced with the blasphemous intonations of Void Speech, and it is the most common way for mortals, particularly adventurers, to have their first brush with the Void's taint. Lore and knowledge gathered from tainted sources or the mindbending unreality of the Void itself seep into a creature's mind and soul. Even some places become spiritually polluted if the barrier to the existing world wears thin or breaks.

#### Void Taint

Void taint is a measure of how much the Void's influence has seeped into and corrupted a creature's essence. Accumulating too much Void taint causes madness and physical debilitation.

Whenever a creature is exposed to Void taint, it risks losing a small piece of itself to that influence. The Void attacks the very reality of the exposed creature, overwriting a fragment of its personal reality with a twisted version. An exposed creature must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC based on the severity of the exposure, as described on the Void Exposure table.

On a successful save, the creature might be shaken or upset by the experience, but suffers no ill effects. Once a creature has succeeded on a saving throw against a particular kind of Void exposure, it is unaffected by further exposures of the same type until it finishes a long rest.

**Void Exposure**

| Creature... | Charisma Save DC |
|-------------|------------------|
| finishes a rest within a Void-tainted area | 10 |
| learns Void-tainted lore | 10 |
| attunes to a Void-tainted magic item | 15 |
| learns a mythos magic or Void magic spell | 10 + spell level |
| is subjected to a mythos magic or Void magic spell of 6th level or higher | Caster's spell save DC |
| encounters a creature of the Void for the first time | 10 + creature's Charisma modifier |
| is exposed to the Void itself | 20 |
^void-exposure

On a failed save, the creature gains 1 point of Void taint. A creature can accumulate an amount of Void taint equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier (minimum of 2 points) without harm. When a creature's Void taint exceeds that number, it is afflicted with a form of indefinite madness and its Void taint total resets to 0. To determine which type of madness emerges, refer to the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Indefinite Madness (KPDM).md\|Indefinite Madness]] table.

Instead of bearing this scar on its psyche, a creature can choose to channel the Void's influence into a physical change, known as a flesh warp. The Void can produce an infinite variety of these effects, ranging from subtle to terrifying; the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Flesh Warps (KPDM).md\|Flesh Warps]] table offers a number of possibilities. A creature that has any flesh warp has disadvantage on Charisma checks involving a creature not of the Void for any purpose other than intimidation.

On either the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Indefinite Madness (KPDM).md\|Indefinite Madness]] table or the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Flesh Warps (KPDM).md\|Flesh Warps]] table, a die roll dictates the outcome unless the GM decides otherwise. Under no circumstances should a player be allowed to choose a desired result.

##### Curing Flesh Warps and Void Taint

A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell removes 1 point of Void taint from the target, in addition to curing the target's indefinite madness, if the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.

Flesh warps are permanent manifestations of the Void within the body of a tainted creature and are incredibly difficult to remove. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Regenerate.md\|regenerate]] spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a creature of a flesh warp.

## Mythos Magic

The work of author H. P. Lovecraft—the so-called "Cthulhu mythos"—has been a cornerstone of RPG storytelling since E. Gary Gygax immortalized its influence in his "Inspirational and Educational Reading" list. Taking its name from Lovecraft's famous story, "The Call of Cthulhu," the mythos has become the backdrop for a subgenre of fiction sometimes called cosmic horror. At the foundation of cosmic horror are two ideas: that the human mind is too tiny and weak to comprehend more than the barest glimmer of the vastness of the universe and the alien mysteries it contains; and that among those mysteries are entities so ancient, powerful, and malevolent that they could extinguish Earth's insignificant civilization without caring or even noticing.

With that in mind, this section explores those "hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars" that Lovecraft and his contemporaries pioneered in their strange fiction. Herein you will find a host of forbidden secrets and eldritch lore; a clandestine sort of magic that is full of both cosmic potential and horrific consequences, and knowledge of which erodes the sanity of all who pursue it.

### Essence of the Void

The spells in this category resemble Void magic in that they harness the power of the Void, but they are not beholden to it. Mythos magic uses the Great Old Ones as a conduit for its power, while Void magic originates from the Void itself (a place of negation and emptiness that devours the cosmos, not an entity).

Mythos spells can be learned by anyone with magical aptitude—any character who has the ability to cast spells can add mythos spells to their spell list. All other characters can acquire a mythos spell only if they learn it from one of the forbidden and furtive tomes of the Cthulhu mythos or see the spell being cast.

But this power comes at great risk. Casters of mythos magic literally exchange their sanity for magical ability. Unless a character is protected by great Wisdom or a bulwark of arcane wards, using these spells will certainly lead to madness.

### Mythos Magic Spell Lists

Mythos magic is typically the province of [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|wizards]], although any spellcaster can learn these spells under the right circumstances.

Mythos magic seethes with the unnameable secrets of the Great Old Ones—alien beings from beyond space and time whose warped, eldritch minds are immeasurably superior to our own and whose sinister, loathsome agendas challenge not only our sanity but our very existence.

Many of the spells in this section refer to and take inspiration from specific Great Old Ones and Elder Gods of the Cthulhu mythos. These names can serve as narrative waypoints as you chart the cosmic apocalypse of a mythos‑laden campaign. In the same spirit of collaboration that fueled Lovecraft's circle of writers, you should feel free to develop your own Mythic entities.

Some of the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods central to mythos magic include: Cthulhu, Yog‑Sothoth (the Beyond‑One), Shub‑Niggurath (the Black Goat of the Woods), Bokrug, Tsathoggua, Koth, Bran Mak Morn, Nodens, Nyarlathotep (the Crawling Chaos), Hastur, Hriggala (the Jaws of Vardesain), the Magnum Innominandum (the Not‑to‑Be‑Named One), Yig (the Father of Serpents), and the White Goddess.

### Grimoires of the Cthulhu Mythos

If antiquity looks upon the stories of Tolkien and dreams of fated rings, or reflects upon the multiverse of Moorcock's White Wolf and thinks of cursed swords, then surely the Cthulhu mythos will be remembered for its magical tomes. Described here are three of the most infamous installments in the mythos atheneum: the accursed *Necronomicon*, Robert E. Howard's *Nameless Cults*, and the ubiquitous *Book of Eibon*. Mythos spells can be learned only from a mythos grimoire like these or through direct contact with a mythos spellcaster—and those grimoires and casters take many abhorrent forms.

With a multiverse-wide perspective in mind, these books are considered to be translations of the "real world" originals—which is to say, they come from the alternate-history Earth of Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos setting, including elements of Howard's Hyborian Age. How they made their way through time and space to wind up on alien worlds or your own setting is the stuff of splendidly macabre speculation (and ultimately is up to you, the GM). One thing's for sure: these tomes are beyond precious to all who hunger for the eldritch knowledge of the Great Old Ones, and such longings aren't restricted to humanity and near-humanity. There also exist multitudes of odious aberrations, monstrosities, fiends, and worse entities who will stop at nothing to possess these tomes.
