# Angelic Magic

The heavenly planes shine with light and power, as deities both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones. Without question, the most powerful of those gods' servants are the angels. Angels carry the word of their creators to mortal ears and bring down their righteous blades against creatures of darkness. These entities are mighty beyond mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels are hidden within those names, and a select few mortals have learned how to realize that potential.

The first angelic seals and wards were passed to worthy mortals as rewards for their sacrifice and valor in the service of light, and as weapons to be used in the struggle against the fiendish hordes. An angelic seal is the written form of the true name of an angel, inscribed on an object or a surface in a particular way to draw on the essence of that angel's power. That power flows through the written representation and into the individual who carries it, or into a location that bears a ward. The angel isn't harmed or hindered when a fraction of its power is siphoned this way, but it does notice, and woe befalls any wicked soul who steals the secret of a seal and misuses its power.

## Angelic Spells

Seals and wards aren't the only expressions of angelic power available to mortals. In the ages since the first angelic names were carved into earthly forms, the battles between light and darkness have tested the limits of the heavenly host. In the wake of these struggles, mortal practitioners experimented with variations on the seals and found ways to isolate the power of the angels and shape it into spells.

Knowledge of angelic spells is rare, and it's not possible for a spellcaster to develop or learn these esoteric spells without being trained in these specialized practices. Occasionally, the powers of light make a gift of a particular spell to a favored champion. Also, tomes containing the notes and experiments of the first angelic scribes still exist in hidden libraries and forgotten shrines.

A spellcaster fortunate enough to discover an angelic spell in written form can gain access to it through study. The usual method of gaining this access is through the pursuit of the angelic scribe wizard specialty. Angelic scribes preserve the knowledge embodied in the angels' names and pass those secrets to their apprentices so the forces of good will always be able to wield their mightiest weapons in times of need.
