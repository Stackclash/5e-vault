When the elves first developed their magic long ago, the spells they learned to use were all cast as rituals. Over time, researchers who came later discovered how to cast most spells more quickly and with greater potency—at the expense of sapping their energy and leaving them in need of recuperation.

Some of the original elven rituals are still being taught and used today—and just as in the distant past, they can be cast only as rituals. That aspect of their nature sets them apart from all other spells, because it means that anyone who can cast one of these spells can do so repeatedly, without needing to draw on enough of their inner power to deplete their magical ability.

## Ritual Focus

Another quality unique to elven ritual magic is the ability of the caster to call upon inner reserves and expend extra effort to improve or enhance the effect of an elven ritual spell. This extra effort is represented by the caster's ritual focus. Each of the spell descriptions ends with a paragraph that explains the effect of expending the ritual focus on the casting of that spell.

Unlike a normal spellcasting focus, a ritual focus is not an object; it's a state of mind. And once this mental energy has been expended, a caster's ritual focus can't be used again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.

> [!note] Ritual Caster or Not
> 
> Elven ritual magic can be incorporated into the game in one of two ways, depending mainly on whether the GM uses the rules for feats. If so, then it might be necessary for a character to have the [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Ritual Caster.md\|Ritual Caster]] feat before any of these spells can be employed. If not, then—unless the GM decides otherwise—a character can cast any of these spells as normal, provided that they appear on his or her spell list.
