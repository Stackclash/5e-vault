# Arcane Traps
*Source: Deep Magic, p. 346* 

Wizards and other practitioners of magic create traps that use spells as much as they use physical objects; some of these hindrances have features in common with pits and spear traps, while others rely on a series of finely wrought glyphs or enchanted components that require arcane knowledge to identify, much less disarm. A small collection of these traps is provided here.
