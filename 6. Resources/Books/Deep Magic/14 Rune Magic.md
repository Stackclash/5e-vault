# Rune Magic

Writing can be an expression of magic, and a way to trap and focus arcane energy. This precept is the foundation of rune magic, which requires carving, writing, or otherwise generating glyphs, sigils, signs, and runes of many kinds. This practice is quite common among many different people, from dwarves and druids to northlanders and even some goblin tribes. The rune magic presented here is somewhat northern-flavored, but it could easily serve for dwarven runes, druidic ogham, or goblin graffiti magic. The deeper understanding is that shapes bind power, and that magic can be made tangible. That tangible magic can be a stone rune, a silvery sigil, or even a bloody scrawl—its power functions regardless of how it was made.

## Rune Powers

Accessing the magic inherent within runes requires the [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Knowledge (KPDM).md\|Rune Knowledge]] feat. If the option to gain feats isn't used in your campaign, then [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Knowledge (KPDM).md\|Rune Knowledge]] can be gained in place of level-based ability score improvement, if your GM approves. Alternatively, characters might need to accomplish other, story-related tasks determined by the GM to gain [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Knowledge (KPDM).md\|Rune Knowledge]]. Once those obstacles are cleared, all characters who meet the prerequisites can gain [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Knowledge (KPDM).md\|Rune Knowledge]] and [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Mastery (KPDM).md\|Rune Mastery]]. A character who acquires the [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Knowledge (KPDM).md\|Rune Knowledge]] feat can begin making use of the runes described here.

When one of your rune powers calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Your applicable ability modifier is the same one being used for the saving throw unless a different ability is specified; for example, if a rune calls for a Charisma saving throw, your Charisma modifier is used to set the DC.

## Invoking Rune Powers

Invoking one of a rune's powers requires an action and provokes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attacks]]. Generally, you must either create a physical representation of the rune (in paint, in blood, drawn in the dirt or snow, and so forth) or trace the shape of an existing carving of the rune that was created to an exacting standard.

Each rune confers a benefit on someone who knows how to scribe it. A rune's benefit is always in effect for a character who knows that rune. In addition, that character can call upon one of the rune's powers when so desired. Unless otherwise noted, any rune power can be used once, and that expended use is regained when you finish a long rest.

Some powers have a level requirement (given in parentheses); when a character attains that level, this power becomes an additional choice. Mastery powers are a separate category: only a character who has the [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Mastery (KPDM).md\|Rune Mastery]] feat for a particular rune can use its mastery power. If a power or a mastery power has no level requirement, it becomes available to you as soon as you acquire the necessary feat.

If a rune's power gives you the ability to cast a spell, you can do so without needing any components (aside from materials needed for the drawing of the rune), and the spell is always cast as if using the lowest-level spell slot possible. It typically has the same duration as a normal casting of the spell, and uses your character level as the caster level.

When a rune power calls for a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your ability bonus + your proficiency bonus. Typically, the ability that applies to the DC calculation is the same as the ability used for the saving throw.
