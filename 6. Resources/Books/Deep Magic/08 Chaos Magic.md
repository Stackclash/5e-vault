There exists a form of raw arcane power with no rules or structureâ€”only an unthinking addiction to changing the reality with which it comes into contact. This force is known as chaos magic. Those who learn to channel this energy eventually expand and aid this magic in its chaos; to master it, though, chaos demands an emotional price of extreme highs and lows. An eccentric lifestyle or even full-on madness is common among chaos magic specialists, who are collectively known as chaos mages.

## Chaos Magic Surges

The use of chaos magic sometimes causes a chaos magic surge. This phenomenon is similar to the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Wild Magic Surge.md\|wild magic surge]] caused by some [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Sorcerer Wild Magic.md\|sorcerers]]. When a chaos magic surge has a chance of occurring, the caster rolls a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, roll `dice:1d100|noform|avg|text()` (`1d100`) and consult the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Chaos Magic Surge (KPDM).md\|Chaos Magic Surge]] table to determine the result.
