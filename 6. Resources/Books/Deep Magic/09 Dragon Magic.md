# Dragon Magic

Some scholars believe that true magic springs only from deep inside an individual creature, such as a dragon or a demon, and those possessing bloodlines from such terrible creatures can tap their personal magical stores. Others speculate that magic comes only from other planes of existence or from the gods themselves.

The truth is that magic comes from several sources, and powerful beings can utilize any wellspring of magic to craft spells and fuel seemingly miraculous effects. One of the first creatures to master all types of magic were the majestic and terrible dragons. Although they were capable of controlling the elements and inducing terrible fear, they also mastered more subtle magic. They wove a tapestry of magic into their homes, giving their lairs innate defenses. They taught their servants, from humans to kobolds to elves, how to make use of the magic that permeated the atmosphere. And they also passed on to their kin—both true dragons and lesser creatures—the kind of magic that roiled in blood and bone.

Dragon magic is a distinct branch of arcane study, founded in the Draconic language and in an elemental understanding of arcane forces.
