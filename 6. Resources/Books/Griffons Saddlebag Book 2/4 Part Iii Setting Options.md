## Antronec, the City of Artisans

The City of Artisans is aptly named, for Antronec accurately boasts some of the finest crafters and tradesmen of all kinds. It is a city wholly dedicated to open trade, the acquisition of wealth, and the crafting of exceptional goods. The numerous artisans keep order amongst themselves with guilds: powerful factions that vie for influence over the city and its extensive trade opportunities. At the heart of this tangled economic web, The Mercantile Guild acts as administrators and ambassadors that keep the peace between the various guilds, manage the local government, and curry favor with the common folk with honeyed words and clever schemes.

Within the city, virtually any material good can be found for a price from the right merchant or crafter. The city's size and population make it an ideal locale for complicated plots and intrigue in your campaign, as well as a potential origin for one or more of its characters. At any given moment, each guild is likely to be planning, implementing, or benefiting from a conspiratorial political or economic maneuver against their fellows. Each guild and their powerful members have their own motives and goals, and in Antronec, even the most kind-hearted and charitable facade can belie machinations of thievery, assassination, and other stratagems. Adventurers, in particular, have many options, such as partnering with Antronec's powerful guilds, joining the city's organized adventuring agencies, or attempting to forge their own path to success.

### Ambient Mood

Trying to keep track of the moving parts of the city is nigh impossible, as vibrant colors and hasty movement swirl in a chaotic visual cacophony. Odors of in-progress and completed products often blend with each other in a peculiar symphony, such as the scent of fried delicacies mingling with freshly-oiled leathers and metals. Conversation is difficult outdoors, as the tireless street barkers and merchants try to pull attention away from the general buzz of trampling feet and sounds of production. The weather is often pleasant, but the mood is primarily focused on Antronec's competitive and fast-paced marketing atmosphere.

- To see the streets of Antronec is akin to peering into an insect hive—the city is packed and crowded with people traversing its streets in hectic fashion. There's almost always at least one caravan traveling on one of the four major highways that connect the city center to the quieter farmlands and pastures outside the city's borders. A closer look at the streets and people is overwhelming, as each individual and building visually shouts for attention with bright and clashing colors, patterns, and outlandish fashions. Even worse, most of the buildings and skyline are crowded with painted billboards and banners of all shapes, the city's general preference for bright and shiny sizes, and styles. These advertisement boards and things even affects the interior and exterior designs of the city's architecture—what type of decorations and building styles are in vogue often changes overnight.  
- Most portions of the city's surface are awash with the varying and rich scent of metals, wood, herbs, baked goods, potent spices, and other vibrant smells produced by the city's numerous craftsmen. There are clashing sections where the tanneries and forges produce harsher odors, but those neighborhoods usually have larger concerns. Venturing into the city's sewer system, on the other hand, assaults the olfactory senses with the waste of a vast populace and plenty of underground denizens that call those tunnels home.  
- Antronec is a city that's as noisy at night as it is during the day due to its size and culture, which usually requires new visitors some time and effort to adapt to. Evening workers create sounds like the clanging of hammers on anvils, the shattering of stone, the shouts of merchants, and other grating effects. Some areas are affluent enough to have buildings insulated from the sound, but most simply adjust and carry on. Those who struggle with the noise are able to cope by commissioning noise-canceling enchantments like sirensong silencers or similar items.  
- The competitive energy that pervades the city streets is almost palpable, as the merchants vie for consumer attention like a never-ending auction house. At every turn, every purchase, a buyer has dozens of choices to make regarding quality and quantity, level of expense, and so forth. The city's usually balmy and temperate weather contributes by encouraging mobile, outdoor market stalls for many salesmen, though the most successful ones can afford permanent locations and advertising on the city's numerous billboards.  

> [!note] Billboards
> 
> In Antronec, the architecture has uniquely developed to host dozens upon dozens of large wooden advertising boards. They're covered in brightly colored depictions of products and services, sales and discounts, and directions to the relevant shop. Most denizens of Antronec, if questioned about this practice, simply shrug and say that you just get used to it.

### Origin & History

The city of Antronec is a sprawling metropolis, but it wasn't always this way. Founded at the crossroads of two newly-built roadways, typical craftsmen and merchants began to set up shop and service travelers. With few nearby resources besides herd animals and small farms, trade and frugality governed the growing hamlet. Faced with an unexpected and unusually difficult winter, some of the artisans began to barter their services—for instance, the weaver's fabric clippings being used by the cobbler to insulate both pairs of shoes to keep their feet warm. Come springtime, these mutually beneficial trades began to be drafted as contracts, and gradually became oriented more towards efficiency than mere survival. Their collective skills produced better goods and rapidly attracted more merchants and crafters as the town continued to grow. Similar-skilled tradesmen organized small, exclusive guilds that required little investment but provided little in return.

Eventually, Antronec reached a size that required peacekeepers to mediate  the guilds' growing grudges and rivalries. A traveling group of clever merchants formulated an idea. They offered their services as a neutral party capable of evenhandedly resolving disputes and conflicts, which were gratefully accepted. As they expanded their influence, they desired more—so they proposed a further modification to the city's structure that would formalize and consolidate the numerous guilds into a more manageable number. What these newly formed guilds did not realize was that this purportedly neutral Mercantile Guild was in the perfect position to guarantee their permanent status as administrators on top of the other guilds.

Under the subtle influence of this leadership, Antronec blossomed. These cunning administrators appealed to travelers and citizens alike by providing entertainment, and utilized their honeyed words to keep the peace between arguing guilds just enough to divert and distract them from their often underhanded activities. They also quickly realized that their unsupervised contracts, letters, and even publicized theatrics  offered an excellent means of concealing and transferring secrets and cypher: perfect tools for espionage and the manipulation of public opinion. Using their charm and economic savvy, as well as their darker machinations, the Mercantile Guild soon expanded their bureaucratic network to begin organizing into specialized departments, ensuring their control over the city's water, youth, military, and so forth.

#### The Mercantile Guild

> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-mercantile.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Mercantile Guild</span>")

Although referred to as a guild, this political and economic faction actually governs the people and other guilds of Antronec. From the Administrative Capitol Building in the Gilded Quarter, the Guildmasters direct and supervise the city's affairs. Guildmaster Chantelle Redcliff, a female human, and her spouse Thrift Redcliff, a female tiefling, maintain Antronec's public services, draft legislation, monitor the economy, and meet with ambassadors to discuss foreign affairs. They also coordinate the city's judges, recordkeeping, banks and mint. Career politicians, they direct public opinion and mediate guild tensions with their charm and cunning. Indeed, most members of this guild are skilled wordsmiths, or even bards dedicated to the study of arcane magic and monetary gain, but are almost entirely unaware of the nefarious lengths that their leaders will go through to maintain control.

Under the Redcliffs' crafty leadership, The Mercantile Guild has maintained its stranglehold on Antronec, utilizing its considerable resources and intra-guild relationships to ensure that they stay a step ahead of and in the favor of the other guilds. This requires vast amounts of legal—and illegal—manipulation of the city and its denizens, keeping the guilds on their toes and at each other's throats. Even Antronec's black market is owned and operated almost entirely by The Mercantile Guild, though only a few outside the guild's upper echelon are aware. The Guildmasters have been targets of numerous plots, attempted assaults and assassinations, but these have only resulted in stricter laws, a quality prosthetic leg for Chantelle, and even more devious economic subterfuge.

The Mercantile Guild forms and breaks alliances in a heartbeat as they navigate and manipulate the political landscape of Antronec. At any given moment, there are likely three or four guilds actively and secretly working to topple the Guild's control over them. Such attempts have thus far always failed, due to the sheer power and wealth that the Mercantile Guild holds in government and the sale of illicit goods in the black market. Similarly, when truly threatened, the Mercantile Guild can simply manufacture means of toppling the trade routes, suppliers, and perceived value of the threatening parties, forcing their opponents' hands into submitting once more to Mercantile control.

The official political icon of Antronec and the Mercantile Guild is a golden coin and pair of outstretched hands upon a bold red banner. This is said to represent the boldness of Antronec's original settlers and their dedication to open and honest trade. Within the inner circles of The Mercantile Guild and their black market, however, the insignia is known to represent how much blood people are willing to shed over material wealth— evidence that they need a firm guiding hand from the guild in order to flourish, as Antronec currently does.

Support from The Mercantile Guild can come in the following ways:

- Use of one of their many governmental buildings for meetings or office space.  
- Limited access to their spies, defense service, or black market.  
- General instruction relating to economic manipulation and wealth accumulation, as well as other relevant financial advice.  
- Various other assistance such as access to equipment, high-quality products, or insight.  

#### Government Branches & Divisions

To aid in the administration of Antronec, the Mercantile Guild has instituted various public services, programs, and managerial systems. These branches and divisions constitute a nightmarishly convoluted bureaucratic web that helps ensure that only the Mercantile Guild can retain operation of Antronec. Although confusing, many of these programs and services serve a dual purpose by keeping the populace healthier and happier, guaranteeing a positive public opinion of the government as a whole.

The Antronec Branches and Divisions table details the various branches and divisions of the Mercantile Guild—Antronec's government—operating under the direction of the Guildmasters.

> [!note] Curators & Appraiser's Eyes
> 
> In Antronec, there are a few dozen individuals called curators that have been granted magical prosthetic eyes, [[5. Mechanics/Items/Appraisers Eye (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|appraiser's eyes]], that allow them to precisely determine the value of magical and mundane objects. With these, the Mercantile Guild is able to effectively monitor and alter the prices of goods in Antronec to ensure optimal retail value and maximum profit.

### Artisan Guilds

In metropolitan Antronec, the various guilds of artisan crafters are large, powerful, and driven solely by economic gain. As a result, each guild is exceptionally diverse in composition, with ancestral heritage crafters working right alongside first-generation or immigrant artists. Because it is primarily a meritocracy, each guild member in Antronec is judged by the quality of their craft and their business acumen. Businesses and individuals associated with a guild are required to post the guilds insignia outside of their workplace, as depicted below.

Each guild has its own strengths, weaknesses, leadership, and bureaucratic composition. Their office buildings vary in style and function, but are all notably imposing structures. Each faction has one prime allied guild, and one primarily antagonistic faction that they clash most with. Antronec's economic arena is perpetually active as each guild vies for dominance over the others, both of their own accord and because of manipulation from the Mercantile Guild.

Players trying to navigate through the city's often precariously balanced social landscape will likely struggle to gain favor unless they commit to joining or formally contracting with a specific guild of their choice. This comes with various dangers, but can also provide great benefits.

Support from a guild can come in the following ways:

- Use of their headquarters for meetings and office space.  
- Limited access to their spies, informants, and secret message network.  
- General instruction relating to their particular artisan tools and craftsmanship, as well as occasional financial advice.  
- Various other assistance such as access to equipment, high-quality products, or insight.  

#### Alchemical Federation, Alchemists Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-alchemists.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>Alchemical Federation, Alchemists Guild</span>")

The Federation Greenhouse is the beating heart for Antronec's guild of apothecaries, alchemists, chandlers, fullers, and herbalists of all kinds. Here, Grand Philosopher Seraphi Nullshade and her husband Chief Herbalist Geoffran Nullshade organize sales and inventory of the city's chemicals. As the proprietors of The Ambrosia Fountain, the human couple are known for their literal and metaphorical groundbreaking advancements in alchemy and herbalism despite their relative youth. Foremost among their inventions thus far is an alchemical potion that greatly aids in balancing the intense mood and energy swings that individuals like Sullivas experience.

Besides their medical advancements, the Nullshades are also responsible for instituting a formal testing and patent system for Antronec's potion crafters and herbalists, patterned after the system used by The Filigreed Union. This has been quite controversial, but has also seen a drastic decrease in death and injury from unproven or inaccurately prescribed medicines. When a storefront or alchemist wishes to proclaim their membership in the federation, they fly a varying number of bright green streamers embroidered with their insignia using silver thread.

##### Allies

Generally, the Alchemical Federation cooperates with the Textile Collective due to a mostly non-overlapping customer base. They also frequently offer potent soaps and cleaning agents to the collective and receive garments that resist chemical damage and discoloration.

##### Enemies

Several decades ago, there was a secret affair between the then-Conductor of The Filigreed Union and the Chief Herbalist of the federation. When events came to light, the repercussions led to a bitter hatred between the two guilds. This animosity has carried forward to today, though most are unaware of the details of the initial conflict and simply perpetuate the evergreen contention.

#### Metallurgy Incorporated, Smiths Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-smiths.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>Metallurgy Incorporated, Smiths Guild</span>")

The day-to-day operations of this faction, made up of all manner of metalworkers, are based out of a smoke-spewing building in the Bazaar of Wonders called the Corporate Foundry. The Supreme Smith, a middle-aged human who goes by the name Lindsay or Lenny Rublessen depending on the day, directs the guild's affairs whenever they're not crafting exquisite weapons at Rublessen Armory. They possess a fiery temper, precious little patience for ego, and an everwarm heart for the young and eager who come to learn from them.

Rublessen's ill temper, usually managed by working in the forge, has occasionally led to hasty decisions for the guild. Luckily, Metallurgy Incorporated operates with an internal system of checks and balances, which has kept the guild profitable and in good standing with the public. In fact, the only gripe most denizens have is the large amount of foundry smoke that can sometimes become trapped under cloud cover. Foundries and forges that have been incorporated into the Guild display a silver marker on their door that has been stamped with the Guild's symbol.

##### Allies

The vast amount of metalworking that Metallurgy Incorporated must process is greatly aided by the use of advanced mechanical tools and inventions provided by The Filigreed Union. The smiths repay their tinkering sponsors by smelting copper, bronze, and brass ingots that are smaller and more precisely refined for clockwork engineering.

##### Enemies

Long ago, a violent feud erupted between Metallurgy Incorporated and the League of Bricks and Mortar. By the smiths' account, those ancient masons foolishly endangered themselves by over-stressing the tools beyond their clearly advertised limits in an attempt to save a few coins. As a result, the cost to obtain masonry tools from Antronec smiths is outrageous, though none can deny that the quality is unmatched.

#### Order of Hues, Painters Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-painters.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>Order of Hues, Painters Guild</span>")

Although they are known for their dedication to self-expression and open creativity, the artisan painters and calligraphers of Antronec organize themselves into a guild to ensure proper pay and recognition in the city's economy. Currently they are led by the dwarven Brushmaster Hjolkam Brightanvil and his elven wife Quillmaster Melodania Brightanvil. When they're not working at the guild headquarters, The Pallette, they produce stunning landscape paintings and calligraphy from their shop, Brightanvil's Artistry. Hjolkam in particular has gained notoriety across the land for his art style, which has shifted from shadowy and foreboding to bright and inspiring as he's transitioned over the last decade and adjusted to the loss of his hearing.

The order is best known for their work on Antronec's numerous billboards and murals, which have helped fund many passion projects for the guild's artisans. The proliferation of advertising in the city has unfortunate-ly led to some distaste for the guild from the majority of the populace, which has consequently pushed the artists further towards the city's wealthy elite. Individual artists, shops, and galleries can be recognized by their display of rainbow-colored maypoles, with the ribbons portraying miniature versions of their insignia.

##### Allies

The Order of Hues works often with The Book Binders on illuminated manuscripts, book illustrations, and the like. They typically request and receive densely woven paper and tightly bound sketchbooks in exchange, though they also send young artists to paint marvelous murals on the libraries and bookshops for practice and to make those buildings stand out.

##### Enemies

A great deal of tension exists between the Order and The Cartographer's Guild. They have to compete directly to obtain expensive ink and other rare drawing supplies when they arrive in Antronec, and there are individuals in both guilds who aren't above the occasional thievery.

#### The Book Binders, Librarians Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-librarians.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Book Binders, Librarians Guild</span>")

Ardent Archivist Nizira Bladesworn, a female half-orc, manages the affairs of this guild of librarians, bookmakers, and book sellers. The guild uses a large warehouse known as The Archive to store and transfer books and materials between the various satellite businesses. Nizira herself owns and operates a shop called Booksworn, a store dedicated to selling autobiographies and writings of marginalized and other atypical authors. The Archivist is known for her large stature, wise perspectives, and love for explicit storytelling. Rumor has it that she'll soon complete her goal to read and rate the quality of every published romance in Antronec.

The Book Binders tend to be unobtrusive and quiet, beloved by commoners for their public libraries, by artisans for their detailed manuals and textbooks, and by the wealthy for their ability to find and collect rare manuscripts of all kinds. Shops and repositories affiliated with this guild display elaborate murals on their walls and storefronts, usually depicting legendary heroes, monstrous beasts, and other similar designs alongside their painted crest.

##### Allies

The aforementioned murals are all gifts to The Book Binders from the Order of Hues, with each one symbolizing their shared dedication to art and expression. The Order also provides commissioned art for book covers and illustrations, usually as a trade for quality sketchbooks and paper.

##### Enemies

In contrast, The Book Binders frequently clash with the Lumber Company over imported wood resources, especially during the winter months when caravans of supplies are less numerous. Softwoods are valued for certain furniture pieces and for most standard papermaking, while hardwoods make sturdy furnishings and high-quality paper for arcane practitioners and artists.

#### The Cartographer's Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-cartographer.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Cartographer's Guild</span>")

On the surface, The Cartographer's Guild purports to be a guild of simple mapmakers and navigators who help make the world a safer place to traverse. In actuality, this faction intentionally utilizes their maps, clockwork ink beetles,  and bands of the found and lost  to manipulate overeager adventurers and reckless travelers as pawns to help the guild find and acquire treasure with less risk to themselves. The guild and its devious schemes operate under the guidance of the eponymous Cartographer herself, an aged elven matron named Kaybella Dawnquill. She originally founded the guild and set forth these practices in her youth with the support of her late husband, but now directs their clandestine and public affairs alone. These days, she spends most of her time at the guild's headquarters, The Geographical Reserve, and leaves management of Dawnquill Cartography to her great-grandchildren.

In the public eye, The Cartographer's Guild is a frequent and generous benefactor of Antronec's adventuring agencies and freelance adventurers alike. Only the most paranoid spymasters suspect that this portrayal might be an elaborate cloak for sinister motivations. Members of this guild are identified by their doors, which are painted with their sigil using a dark, dusky yellow paint.

##### Allies

The Cartographer's Guild has a healthy partnership with the Tastemaker Society, providing their chefs with unusual and rare ingredients from their travels and receiving catered banquets in exchange. The Cartographers will often use these extravagant dishes to curry favor with traveling bands of adventurers and enlist their services at discounted rates.

##### Enemies

Though usually not violent in nature, the guild does have occasional bidding wars and competition with the Order of Hues to obtain the finest inks for their maps and charts.

#### The Filigreed Union, Tinkers Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-tinkers.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Filigreed Union, Tinkers Guild</span>")

Much of Antronec's technological advancement is a direct result of the Filigreed Union's dedication to progress. From their office called The Factory, the blind tiefling Conductor Expertise Everbloom and their half-elven husband Bright-Facet Kerrigan Everbloom brainstorm revolutionary designs and handle patents for the guild's many tinkers and jewelers. They also take commissions for elaborate and gem-studded inventions at their business, Everbloom's Ingenuity. The couple are prodigies in their craft, and are notably the youngest guildmasters the Union and Antronec have ever seen. Consequently, the city has seen a sharp increase in young tinkers, especially from blind youth who strive to emulate Expertise's unprecedented example. 

Recent years under the Everblooms' direction has revitalized Antronec's love for clockwork devices and wind-up toys. The proceeds have helped fund additional billboard advertising for the Union, and made them a household name. Tinkers and jewelers affiliated with the Union display a functioning version of their crest, a large brass cog with a glass gem and filigreed minute and hour hands that show the time.

##### Allies

The Filigreed Union trades frequently and in large amounts with Metallurgy Incorporated, typically under contracts exchanging custom mechanical or delicate tools for the smiths' highest quality ingots of brass, bronze, and copper.

##### Enemies

As previously mentioned, longstanding animosity exists between the Union and the Alchemical Federation due to an affair amongst the leadership several decades ago. In practice, this hostility means that the two guilds practically shun each other and often disagree on large-scale policies simply for the sake of disagreement and stubbornness.

#### The Hospitality Collaborative, Brewers Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-brewers.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Hospitality Collaborative, Brewers Guild</span>")

Due to its crossroads-spanning position, Antronec sees vast amounts of travelers who all need a place to rest and regain their strength. The collaborative is made up of the many taverns, inns, and breweries of the city, and coordinates policy and prices from the Fermentation Warehouse in the Bazaar of Wonders. The Quicksteps, Brewmeister Jefan the male gnome and Grand Innkeeper Wren the male goblin, manage the ritzy Antronec Hotel and mediate any guild disputes. Several years ago, a disastrous fire at the hotel took Wren's life, but was successfully resurrected with the aid of some precarious magic. The originally female gnome was brought back to life in a male goblin's body, which was both miraculous as much as it was challenging. Wren took some time to work through the learning curve and get used to being male, let alone being a goblin, but steadily gained confidence as the loving couple worked through the adjustments together. This period of personal growth and development directly contributed to the devoted couple's professional rise in standing within the guild, as they pioneered new ideas and renovated the flame-scarred hotel.

Under their management, the collaborative has gone through major interior renovations and drastically improved the quality of Antronec's taverns and inns, breathing vibrant new life into the city. This has only been possible because Jefan's atypical perspective allowed him to scour the guild's records and perform necessary rearrangements that boosted productivity and saved a large amount of coin that they immediately funneled into the revitalization effort. Businesses that are part of the collaborative fly a royal purple ensign depicting their emblem in silver thread.

##### Allies

The collaborative has strong and long-lasting contracts with the League of Bricks and Mortar. They ensure that the league's workers are provided with alcohol and decadent meals in exchange for deeper cellars, stronger foundations, and a guarantee for quality renovations and new construction whenever needed. With this investment, the taverns and breweries of the guild suffer less loss of product and are more profitable due to the increased space efficiency.

##### Enemies

Of all the guilds, the Tastemaker Society is most despised by the Hospitality Collaborative. Both guilds believe their work to be more valuable than the other's, and make a point to discredit each other's work wherever possible. The direct competition between tavern chefs and restaurateurs has inspired many spirited songs, but occasional inter-guild violence demonstrates that this rivalry is not to be underestimated.

#### The League of Bricks and Mortar, Masons Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-masons.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The League of Bricks and Mortar, Masons Guild</span>")

Draftlord Kemrel Emberscale, a female dragonborn, directs the efforts of Antronec's finest stonemasons, sculptors, and architects. When she's not at the drafting table in her shop, Emberproof Architecture, she can be found at the league's headquarters, nicknamed The Blueprint. The Draftlord is notorious for her social disinterest, seemingly tireless energy, and frequent insomnia. The latter two push her to work very inconsistent hours at her shop and office, but also produce some of Antronec's most stunning buildings.

The league as a whole has a reputation for ponderous but high-quality work. Thanks to their strict architectural controls and building inspections, Antronec has seen very few building-related accidents over the decades. The city is large enough, however, that the amount of time and detours that larger demolition and construction projects cause can often raise tensions—especially when the Pristine Transportation Maintenance is repairing roadways nearby. Stonemasons affiliated with The League of Bricks and Mortar fly burnt-orange or brown pennants sewn to display their badge.

##### Allies

As a general rule, the League has the most contracts with the Hospitality Collaborative. The masons provide deep, strong cellars and foundations for the brewers and taverns with their most skilled workers, while the collaborative provides the largely dwarven league members with quality brews to celebrate a project's completion.

##### Enemies

According to historical records, the intense rivalry between the League and Metallurgy Incorporated seems to have originated due to a disagreement between early masons and smiths over the price and quality of chisels and hammers. Most league members assert that the long-festering issue was entirely the smiths' fault, having sold their ancestors slag-crafted tools that led to accidents and injuries when used. Even now, the price of mason's tools are exorbitant, and the two guilds almost never vote together on any given topic.

#### The Lumber Company, Carpenters Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-carpenters.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Lumber Company, Carpenters Guild</span>")

In most circles, The Lumber Company is viewed as one of Antronec's more down-to-earth guilds, partially because The Carver's Lodge, their center of operations, is located in the Bazaar of Wonders instead of the Gilded Quarter. Executive Hewer Sylora Deeproot, a stern female half-elf, runs the company with her wife Senior Whittler Aluisha Deeproot, a long-retired elven warrior. They manage the guild's various carpenters, woodcarvers, and lumberjacks, but also run Deep Roots Carpentry, which specializes in custom elven-style furniture.

The Deeproots tend to run their guild with a firm hand and keen-eyed accountants, but are also very generous to Antronec's poor, ensuring that they have enough firewood and intact roofs leading into the rainy seasons. They also go to great lengths to offer employment to veterans and retired soldiers with mental or physical injuries, and Aluisha herself teaches classes about how to grapple the trauma of war based on her own experiences long ago during the height of the Upheaval. Businesses associated with The Lumber Company are identified by the display of their badge, usually carved into a dark wooden placard.

##### Allies

The Lumber Company trades most often with Unified Cobblecraft, providing scrap wood for shoe forms and receiving quality boots in return.

##### Enemies

Unfortunately, the harsh economic battlefield of Antronec has forced even the Deeproots to engage in various overt and covert operations against the other guilds to ensure survival. In particular, they're often locked in conflict with The Book Binders, using both policy and blade, over access to affordable and quality wood supplies. The Lumber Company in particular despises the idea of having valuable material turned to pulp for meager paper.

#### The Tastemaker Society, Chefs Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-chefs.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Tastemaker Society, Chefs Guild</span>")

The Society is composed of all manner of individual bakers and chefs, along with various restaurants, bakeries, and produce shops. A few popular and profitable street vendors are also offered membership. Mithral Chef Acklinn Kworts, a female halfling, is the current guildmaster. She has devoted her life to the art of cuisine, mastering every known form of food preparation and winning countless competitions. She is ambivalent about romantic entanglements, choosing to focus solely on managing her guild and honing her craft to utter perfection. When she's not running the guild from their headquarters, colloquially known as The Kitchen, she provides friends and wealthy customers with meals at her restaurant, Kworts' Eatery.

Acklinn's dedication to bold experiments and the mixing of food preparation techniques has radically altered Antronec's food and cuisine, which was already eclectic and full of spices given the large amount of trade. She also personally donates large quantities of food to Antronec's less fortunate, though many point out that although she encourages other members of her guild to participate, she has not instituted any guild policies to mandate that the city's hungry be fed. Guild-sponsored businesses are recognized by their silver-dyed guild emblem on a goldenrod-colored flag, although plenty of common street vendors choose to avoid aligning themselves with the guild in fear of becoming involved in their everlasting rivalry with the Hospitality Collaborative.

##### Allies

The Society tends to cooperate with The Cartographer's Guild most, utilizing their maps and connections to adventuring agencies to obtain uncommon or challenging ingredients for their finest recipes. In exchange, the Cartographers have an exquisite catered meal for most meetings at the Geographical Reserve.

##### Enemies

The Hospitality Collaborative is a bitter rival of the Tastemakers, mostly due to their competition over foodstuff supplies. Further, many of the chefs and bakers working in Antronec's many taverns and inns are considered betrayers by the Tastemakers, especially since many of them studied under the Society's tutelage.

#### The Textile Collective, Textile Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-textile.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>The Textile Collective, Textile Guild</span>")

The Collective includes dozens of tanners and leatherworkers, weavers and textile shops. The current guildmasters are the orcish Short-Stitcher Brerrin Fraybeard and his dwarven wife Long-Tanner Brunhilda Fraybeard. The stout orc exudes a patient and calming presence that greatly aids Brunhilda's anxious and excitable personality. Besides guild management, the couple own and run Fraybeard Couture with their children, the most expensive and fashionable clothing store in Antronec. Their gentler leadership has brought The Textile Collective great wealth and success over the last several years: a large improvement over the previous guildmaster.

The Fraybeards are most known for introducing a guild-wide policy that turns otherwise wasted scrap fabric and leather into simple, free, and sturdy clothing for those without the means to purchase them normally. The guild meets and coordinates their efforts within a circular building they call The Spinning Wheel, located in The Gilded Quarter. Their sigil is depicted in brightly colored thread on an azure banner.

##### Allies

The Collective tends to collaborate well with the Alchemical Federation, trading stain-resistant textiles in exchange for high quality soaps from their fullers. This, in conjunction with their fairly distinct target consumers, results in only occasional tension between these guilds.

##### Enemies

Generally, the Collective is perfectly willing to backstab and compete with the other guilds, but none more so than Unified Cobblecraft. This intense rivalry goes back to the initial founding of these two guilds, as their differences in certain sales practices escalated a broad schism, preventing them from forming one single clothiers and cobblers guild. Some even speculate that the Collective's free clothing policy was instituted as a direct challenge or insult to Unified Cobblecraft, which has no such policy despite being based in The Sellers' Slums.

#### Unified Cobblecraft, Cobblers Guild

> [!gallery]
> ![<span style=&quot;font-family: ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unknown117343/homebrew-img/tgs2/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Book/artwork-antronec-guild-cobblers.webp#gallery "<span style=&quot;font-family: ZatannaMisdirection&quot;>Unified Cobblecraft, Cobblers Guild</span>")

From Cordwainer Central in the Sellers' Slums, First Strider Davkin Amberleaf manages finances and inventories for Antronec's master shoemakers and cobblers. In recent years, the gray-haired halfling has struggled to recover from a messy divorce after almost one hundred years of marriage. His workshop, Amber and Leaves Cobblery, is rarely open despite its longstanding reputation for crafting the highest quality adventuring and traveling boots. Talk of a guildmaster replacement or second marriage is frequent and increasingly blatant, but the stubborn halfling refuses to leave his shop or guild without a fight, as tribute to his wife.

Despite their recent waning in popularity and public opinion, Unified Cobblecraft is nonetheless an integral part of Antronec's economic and political landscape. Indeed, many scholars have noted that a trade-based civilization is predicated upon certain elements of safety and health, which footwear provides considerable assistance in obtaining. Artisans that advertise their connection to this faction display white-painted concrete signs that they have imprinted their symbol into using their own feet and shoes.

##### Allies

In order to craft handmade shoes for the many citizens of Antronec, Unified Cobblecraft trades daily with The Lumber Company to obtain wooden shoe forms that can be tailored to each individual. The company receives a steady supply of footwear that provides additional protection against dropped saws, splinters, and the like.

##### Enemies

Seizing upon Unified Cobblecraft's recent struggles, The Textile Collective has escalated their long-held rivalry that dates back to both guilds' founding charters. There is even rumor of a full-blown takeover to absorb the cobblers and permanently reduce the number of guilds in Antronec by one.

### Adventuring Agencies

In direct contrast with the other guilds of Antronec, the various adventuring agencies are not organized under a central leadership but instead independent. These dispa- rate groups vie amongst each other for deals, contracts, and other jobs from the city's guilds. Such opportunities range from hired bodyguard duties and fetch quests to hushed espionage and counterintelligence missions. Because they refuse to collaborate long enough to form a unified Adventuring Guild, adventurers in Antronec have far less political and economic leverage than the artisan guilds. Most adventurers in Antronec work with these agencies to obtain safer and more stable employ- ment than solo adventuring groups, which have to rely on billboards and job notices for income.

Some guilds employ adventurers more than others, but the Cartographer's Guild sponsors dozens of adven- turers by negotiating with these guilds. At the moment, the Talent Ticket adventuring agency has the favor of the Cartographer's Guild, earning them lucrative and exclu- sive contracts across the region. Beyond this, each guild prefers to operate differently, using various recruitment techniques, different systems of membership fees, and outfitting adventurers based on the resources at their disposal.

Joining an adventuring agency can grant the following benefits to adventurers:

- Guaranteed room and board, with quality determined by individual agencies.  
- Typically lucrative contracts for quests and errands from the guilds.  
- Camaraderie and potential allies for challenging adventures.  
- Aid in navigating the political and economic landscape of Antronec.  

#### Gold Horizons

This agency is run by President Thea Stouthammer, and is known for its tenacity. Under her experienced leader- ship, Gold Horizons has maintained its proud reputation as the oldest and most prosperous adventuring agency in Antronec. The widowed dwarf may be long of tooth, but she defends her adventurers like her own children and fights doggedly when negotiating for guild con- tracts. Membership is obtained by completing a series of difficult trials and exacts ten percent of members' adventuring income, but the rewards are ample—access to challenging but profitable quests, discounted equip- ment, and room and board within the agency's lavish dormitories.

Unfortunately, rumors are spreading that her epilepsy, thus far managed with medicine provided by the Al- chemical Federation, has begun to worsen with age. She has also refused to announce a successor publicly, and because her biological children are scattered far across the Material Plane, no one is certain what will become of the guild when she eventually passes.

#### Legion of Heroes

First Officer Fork the Fleet manages this agency current- ly, a shrewd goblin that employs their affinity for finance to run this agency in a cutthroat and agile managerial system. It collects twenty percent of adventurer income as its membership fee, and specializes in combat-ori- ented contracts. In the Legion, adventurers compete directly for ranks, earning them increased wages, priv- ileges, and notoriety. In Antronec's economic rat race, this competition has led to the Legion rapidly ascend- ing in popularity with the guilds while also acting as a crucible to forge some of the city's most formidable and intimidating mercenaries. The agency's lodge is modest, designed in the style of military barracks, with most of its space devoted to the armory and sparring grounds.

With the Legion's income over the last few years, Fork has quickly joined Antronec's aristocracy and is on track to one day rival the Guild leaders themselves. Many individuals drawn to their wealth have attempted to ad- vance their own standing by showering them with lavish gifts, only to be met by general indifference. The Heroes focus instead on competing for their leader's approval, believing that the highest-ranked adventurer will inherit the goblin's wealth and ownership of the agency.

#### Of Books & Blades

This large agency operates under the leadership of the orc Arcanist Charfist and his husband, the male drag- onborn Outrider Karlast Sparktooth. The pair actively recruit mages and warriors of all kinds and are notable for basing their activities out of one of Antronec's sky-piercing towers. The agency tends to foster young, orphaned, or otherwise struggling adventurers, show- ing them the kindness that they were denied in their youths. Karlast, in particular, encourages and sponsors individuals who combat emotional challenges and other similar ailments, drawing from his own experiences to guide them as best he can. Charfist teaches basic arcane lessons, while Karlast helps their charges develop their physical health and combat techniques. This agency is one of the larger in Antronec, but it only accepts quests that are thoroughly vetted.

In place of typical fees or withheld funds, the Spark- tooths have their members provide service in the community and work to keep the tower and grounds well maintained. Because of this, Of Books and Blades is greatly beloved by Antronec's citizenry and referred to as heroes, not just adventurers or mercenaries. They also receive frequent donations of coin and equipment from alumni and other kind-hearted individuals in the city, thus ensuring that the agency stays afloat and can transfer quest funds directly to the fledgling adventurers who earned them. Of course, even with its generous altruism and donations buoying its costs, the agency's location and amenities aren't as lavish as many of their other for-profit competitors.

#### Wayfinders

Lead Huntress Lauralai Farstrider, a female half-elf, es- tablished this agency because she felt that archers and survivalists were underrepresented in the existing adventuring agencies. Over time, the membership gained renown and evolved to also cater to skilled investigators and urban bounty hunters. A natural tracker, Lauralai often accompanies her wayfinders on a hunt, outpacing most and wielding her ballista prosthesis with great skill and accuracy. Membership dues and benefits are fairly standard in most respects. The agency is mostly known for its hunting lodge's comfortable and private lodging, and for its purchase and storage of the largest stockpile of mundane and magical arrows and bolts in all of Antronec.

Lauralai's energetic personality results in a very active private life. She is an active participant in social events like festivals or demonstrations, and goes out of her way to support nearby artisans and merchants whenever pos- sible. As a result, her network of colleagues and cohorts she's met and befriended over the years always look out for her and the Wayfinders, and will often provide special equipment or wares to those aligned with the agency at reduced rates. 

#### The Hunter's Quarry

This agency is well known in Antronec for its brash and bloodthirsty members. It's run by Obadiah Gravemoore, a male human that tracks his membership's kills with red tally marks painted on the facade of their headquar- ters. Applications to join the hunters' ranks are accepted in the form of heads of monsters, which are usually taxidermied and displayed within the agency, or as com- pleted bounties for notorious outlaws. Benefits include access to Antronec's most violent contracts and mon- ster-hunting quests, simple lodging, and a reputation for violence. Gravemoore joins his hunters on contracts only when the beast or monster is one he's yet to collect.

Of late, the agency's membership has been restless, stirring up trouble and causing disturbances in the city's streets and taverns. The number of suitable contracts has been decreasing, as monster populations seem to be declining in the region around Antronec. Citizens have already begun to quietly take bets on whether the agen- cy will stay afloat, go bankrupt, or be forcefully disband- ed by the Civil Defense Service for unlawful conduct. 

#### The Talent Ticket

By far the most populous adventuring agency, The Talent Ticket, led by Captain Kellybelle Flintfang, is the current favorite of The Cartographer's Guild. Obtaining membership with this agency is exceptionally easy, but the tradeoff is a large percentage tax and few benefits other than the large number of quest contracts. As a result, this agency's membership experiences frequent turnover. Flintfang will occasionally offer to accompany adventurers, sharing her considerable knowledge and unique skill sets; she utilizes a mixture of martial and magical abilities.

Some whispers in Antronec claim that The Talent Ticket has some sort of collusion with The Cartogra- pher's Guild to win more contracts, but so far, those that make such claims have mysteriously vanished. In reality, there is a particularly grim deal in place between these two organizations, wherein the Talent Ticket purposefully sends over-enthusiastic adventurers on lethal quests, alerting and allowing the Cartographers to follow be- hind and profit from their likely demise, or finish off the successful but weakened party.

### Exploration

Traveling through Antronec serves as a sort of buffet for the senses, as the three main sections of the city are fun- damentally different from each other and overwhelming in their own way.

**The Sellers' Slums** are a sprawling portion of An- tronec made up of countless twisting and turning alley- ways full of shadows and cutthroats in equal measure. An eerie silence hangs overhead, as wary eyes behind ramshackle stalls and carts offer their wares. In gener- al, the less attention that's drawn to oneself, the better. Every proffered hand obscures its true intent, serving as a distraction for larceny or robbery just as often as vital assistance or honest sales. Few of the merchants in the Slums are guild-sponsored, subjecting them to punish- ing taxation from the Mercantile Guild. This, in conjunc- tion with a proportionately low guard presence, results in rampant criminal activity throughout the Slums.

**The Bazaar of Wonders** is where most artisans and guild-members set up their shops, with barkers calling out from brightly decorated stalls and storefronts. This section of Antronec is marked by flapping banners, bustling crowds, and well-kept cobblestone roadways courtesy of the fine masons of Bricks and Mortar. Some guilds even place their center of operations within this portion of the city, most notably Metallurgy Incorpo- rated, the Hospitality Collaborative, and The Lumber Company. The residential portion of the Bazaar services Antronec's middle class with many small homes and apartments, usually above or behind the merchants storefront.

**The Gilded Quarter** hosts Antronec's upper class, especially high-ranking members of the Guilds. It has a large guard presence, exquisitely maintained streets and landscaping, and architecturally stunning businesses. Permits for street vendors are absurdly expensive, so the Quarter is quiet and peaceful. Extravagant window dressings display the craftsmanship and creativity of Antronec's artisans. The city's elite and most of the guilds operate from within stunning manors found here. Secreted away behind closed doors, various permanent teleportation circles can be found here, although they are zealously guarded and known to exist only by their respective guilds' high ranking members.

#### Antronec Sewers

Seen by many as a warped reflection of the surface, the extensive and labyrinthine Antronec sewer system serves as a riskier but faster and more secretive means of circumnavigating the city. Beyond a number of stan- dard entrances for simple maintenance, the Mercantile and other guilds hoard various secret access tunnels through it to facilitate their various agendas.

You can use the following table to help determine ran- dom secret entrances for your adventurers to uncover.

## The Bloodmire

The Bloodmire is an expansive region of humid swampland that bears a tremendous curse of mutated blood. Where wetlands are drenched with water and mud, the Bloodmire is flooded by a diseased, watery blood called bloodwater. Plants that have adapted to this new life in the bloodwater grow densely in various shades of rusty red and stained browns. Besides the trees grasping above the bloodwater's surface, a vast array of ferns, reeds, and choking vines dot the landscape.

The scraping, splashing, and humming of the ravenous beasts and insects that call this swamp their home serves as an ever-present reminder that blood, like water, is life. Many of these creatures have adapted to their new habitat, and those that survive the diseases of the swamp frequently become carriers of its cursed sicknesses.

The Bloodmire is a hazardous place to travel or live in, but it's not without its fair share of cobbled-together settlements. If they're brave, strong, or foolish enough, the creatures and denizens of this cursed landscape can bring fascinating tales, riches, and experiences to your players.

### Ambient Mood

The slow but constant flow of bloodwater rippling through the Bloodmire can be deceptive, for the canopies above and impenetrable depths below hide abundant wildlife. Ferns and vines sway ever so slightly, bringing a muted dripping as red condensation falls back to the ground. Isolated sunbeams struggle to bring a muted orange light through breaks in the branches above. A hard metallic tang assails the nose, and every surface is slick with the ever-present bloodwater.

- The Bloodmire constantly emanates a cacophony of insect buzzing, frog songs, and rustling undergrowth. The distant splashes of bestial conflict are frequent both above and below the bloodwater.  
- The tree trunks of the swamp are not particularly dense, but they have disproportionately dense canopies. Emphasize how difficult it is to see the sky through the frequent mist and wildlife. Sunlight that does make it through the canopy is tinted with a red haze and makes the bloodwater glisten like a sickening ichor.  
- The majority of plant and animal life in the Bloodmire carries heavy risk of disease, requiring experienced naturalists to identify, hunt, and prepare food safely. Make sure to play up the subtly acrid scent and slight color differences when adventurers successfully avoid diseased resources.  
- The Verdant Heart is a small grove at the center of the swamp that seems completely untouched by the bloodwater of the region. Travelers who make their way into the depths of the Bloodmire will need to use the currents emanating from here, and its anchored position, to safely navigate.  
- Visitors will find that the Bloodmire is often overwhelmingly hot and humid, seemingly unaffected by the time of year. This, in conjunction with the constant thrumming of nature and limited view of the sky, makes the tracking of time and position very difficult.  

### Diseased Swamp

Traversing the Bloodmire offers many dangers, though the foremost is the threat of becoming ill with one or more of its magical diseases. After an encounter with a blood eel, giant mosquito, or creature with 'Bloodmire' in its name, any character that was hit by such a creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become diseased (see the Bloodmire Diseases table). Casting the remove curse spell on a creature ends any Bloodmire disease affecting it.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Bloodmire Diseases (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Bloodmire Diseases]]

### The Crimson Legion

Long ago during the Clash, the evil Legate Malfuriel the Betrayer led his Crimson Legion to battle in the Syre Wood: a strategically-located fey forest that, if conquered, could sway the tides of war in their favor. The legion's relentless army of martial imps and devils took the forest by surprise, quickly slaying the fey and razing the villages in their path as they made their way to the heart of the wood. In a final act of desperation, the forest's lord, Syre, managed to land a debilitating strike on Malfuriel at the cost of his own safety. As he plunged his sword into the Legate's back, he was struck down in turn by the invading legionnaires. While the fiends' shrieks of triumph echoed through the wood, Syre's final curse took hold: binding the legionnaires to the Syre Wood and turning Malfuriel to stone.

That night at dusk, Malfuriel's petrified body suddenly erupted, releasing a foul wave of blood that tainted and stained the Syre Wood—a blight born of his intense hatred of the fey. Gushing waves of Malfuriel's blood swept through the wood, corrupting the beasts that lived there and twisting its plantlife into a grim husk of its former beauty. Protected by Syre's blade's aura, the area immediately surrounding Malfuriel's statue was spared from his lasting corruption: creating the Verdant Heart at the center of what is now known as the Bloodmire.

To this day, the Legate's thousands of oath-bound servants are afraid of Syre's blade and magically warded from entering the Verdant Heart. Trapped in this cursed swamp by the sword's powerful magic, these fiends have slaughtered every fey that dared step outside of the Verdant Heart, and eagerly await their leader's eventual return.

Over time, the Legion managed to repurpose a handful of magical fey orbs, warping their magic to serve the legionnaires' needs instead. These protective orbs originally warded the Syre Wood's fey villages from divination magic, but now serve to mask the appearance of nearby fiends: disguising them as simple humanoids instead. The Crimson Legion imps, which are by far the most common fiend remaining in the Bloodmire, appear as simple halflings when in range of such an orb. An orb has AC 20, 50 hit points, and resistance to all damage. Fiends within 1 mile of an orb are disguised by its magic.

To visitors, the insular 'halflings' of the Bloodmire are kind enough: offering to heal those afflicted by the Bloodmire's diseases for either coin or in exchange for the wings of a sprite. These halflings weave tales about the sprites, warning the characters of their mischief and damage inflicted upon their homes. Shopkeepers explain that they would fetch the wings themselves, but the devious sprites know them too well, and have placed magical wards to deny them access to the Verdant Heart. These are expertly crafted lies told to further the Legion's goals, but a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that something about these statements is amiss.

These disguised fiends can't be detected as fiendish by divination magic or abilities, but can be seen as normal by a creature with true sight. However, there are subtle hints that might convince an observant character that something isn't right with the creatures of these fiendish villages:

- Villagers are extremely careful about not touching the characters.  
- There are no cemeteries or funeral rites performed.  
- There are no children, but there are nursery rhymes and folktales of fey.  
- Villagers are always shown as friendly to those afflicted by the Crimson Sight disease.  

Any questions about these inconsistencies only results in a terse (but not openly hostile) conversation with the villagers. Engaging in combat with any one villager makes all other fiends within eye- and earshot immediately hostile toward the characters.

#### The Verdant Heart

In the center of the Bloodmire, a small area of lush forest clings to life. Hidden by powerful illusions are the last survivors of the Syre Wood's sprites, as well as the petrified remains of **Malfuriel the Betrayer** (see appendix B).

The sprites are very wary of travelers due to the bounty placed on them by the Crimson Legion. Once discovered, the sprites cautiously explain the history of the Syre Wood to the characters. The sprites warn the party that Malfuriel still lives within the stone, and that by removing the ancient blade, they will free him from his prison and release the curses placed on him and his Legion. If the party can successfully convince the sprites to remove the illusions hiding Malfuriel's body, they will lead the party to his location and unveil his lair. Alternatively, a successful DC 30 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the location of the lair, although 2d4 + 4 **sprites** defend it from entry.

Once revealed, the petrified form of Malfuriel can be plainly seen. Syre's blade, Silverwind, *the Cleansing* Breeze, juts out from the body, bathed in a stream of blood that flows from the wound. A creature can remove the sword with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Doing so causes Malfuriel's flesh to revert from its stony state, freeing him to continue his rampage, and signals the start of combat. Use the statistics for Malfuriel on page 11, as well as the map of his lair at saddleb.ag/bloodmire. The Crimson Legion only knows that Malfuriel has returned and their curse has been lifted if he manages to escape from the Verdant Heart. If he does, the fiends rush to the Verdant Heart to slay the remaining fey before leaving the Bloodmire to continue their centuries-old war.

Killing Malfuriel ends the curse on the Bloodmire, allowing it to slowly return to being the Syre Wood over time. Destroying the remaining fiends and Crimson Legion villages speeds up the forest's recovery.

### Exploration

The Bloodmire's dense canopy, hazy red mist, and lack of civilization's touch make navigation difficult. Most settlements and landmarks have no pathways to or from them and require the help of navigational tools and a good sense of direction instead. As such, navigating to even a familiar location without becoming lost requires intense preparation and no small amount of luck or skill.

#### Traveling In The Bloodmire

The speed of traversing the Bloodmire is limited by its flooded state. Sailing is most ideal, though the dangers are not entirely mitigated. Using tree roots, branches, and lashed bridges to navigate takes twice as long due to the difficult terrain. In either case, travelers must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw for each day of travel or become diseased (see the Bloodmire Diseases table) and roll for random encounters once per day.

Travelers without a boat who risk swimming through pools of bloodwater in exchange for a faster travel pace must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw each day of travel or become diseased (see Bloodmire Diseases table). They also roll for random encounters twice per day.

**Bloodmire Navigation DCs**

| DC | Location |
|----|----------|
| 15 | A location in the outskirts of the Bloodmire, or near an outpost |
| 20 | A location near the center of the mire, such as the Verdant Heart. |
| 25 | A location hidden from view, such as a sprite village, secret island, or forgotten fey portal. |
^bloodmire-navigation-dcs

**Becoming Lost**

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^becoming-lost]]`

| dice: d6 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1-4 | Amid backtracking and great confusion, the party ends the day up to 2d6 miles in a random direction away from their destination if sailing, or 1d6 miles away if walking. |
| 5-6 | Using the gradual current of blood emanating from the Verdant Heart, the party ends the day up to 1d6 miles away from their destination despite being lost. |
^becoming-lost

#### Navigation

Travel through the Bloodmire would be difficult enough if it were a normal swamp. With its myriad of dangers and oppressive red mist, a navigation check (roll on the Bloodmire Navigation DCs table) is required to reach any specific location without becoming lost, even if previously visited.

#### Foraging

The swamp's bloodwater is consistent throughout, and blood-corrupted game like squirrels, frogs, fish, and birds are prevalent. A foraging character makes a DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check as normal. There is a 50 percent chance that food or water foraged in the Bloodmire is diseased. A creature that ingests diseased food or water in this way must roll on the Diseased Foraged Food table.

**Diseased Foraged Food**

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^diseased-foraged-food]]`

| dice: d6 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The character is poisoned for 8 hours and rolls on the Bloodmire disease table. |
| 2-5 | The character is poisoned for 1 hour. |
| 6 | The character is not nourished but suffers no other ill effects. |
^diseased-foraged-food

#### Gathering Resources

Bloodbark is a resilient layer of magical wood that can be harvested from the certain kinds of corrupted trees of the Bloodmire. It takes a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) check to find and harvest 1d6 + 4 pounds of it over the course of 8 hours. When bloodbark is used to build objects such as furniture, docks, boats, or coffins, it absorbs blood and prevents unsightly stains. If bloodbark is used to make a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, the weapon is magical, and creatures hit by that weapon don't bleed as a result of the attack. Bloodbark can be sold for up to 1 silver per pound to the right buyer.

A bloodfern is an herb that helps to calm the frenzied or stressed mind when ingested. Most notably, berserkers and lycanthropes take the herb to stifle their rage and bloodlust. It takes a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) check to find and harvest 1d4 pounds of bloodferns over the course of 8 hours. Bloodfern can be sold for up to 10 gold per pound to an interested buyer.

**Example Encounters Table**

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^example-encounters-table]]`

| dice: 4d10 | Result |
|------------|--------|
| 4 | A corrupted fey portal that allows instant travel to a realm of shadows and dread during the New Moon. |
| 5 | A hidden, quicksand-like pool of diseased blood. Each character must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become diseased (see Bloodmire Diseases table). |
| 6 | `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) carnivorous plants. The same number of characters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 2d8 slashing damage and become diseased (see Bloodmire Diseases table) as the plants' vines slice into exposed flesh. |

### Settlements

Settlements located in the Bloodmire are typically transient in one way or another, as the shifting muck and inconsistent blood level necessitate adaptability. Whether constructed from anchored boats or on stilts, or lashed treehouses, tremendous stubbornness is required.

Make sure to emphasize how the humidity affects wooden and rope structures, making them gradually darken and wear down like driftwood, eaten by the corrosive erosion of the swamp. The result is a dark monochromatic wash of crimson fading to brown and black. Wealthier villages or inhabitants may have homes or boats made of bloodbark: a distinguishing and clean feature that separates them from others.

The overarching mood of most settlements is that of survival first and courtesy second. Soft-hearted and soft-handed folk don't last long in the Bloodmire. While not necessarily hostile, most inhabitants have a healthy suspicion of newcomers: especially those draped in fine or clean raiment.

#### Suggested Inhabitants

Various humanoids ill-suited to upper society might make their home in the Bloodmire, far away from the prying eyes of law-keepers or invading armies. Beyond that, the fey and devilish warriors of the Clash are still present, albeit hidden by glamour and illusion.

> [!note] Transfused Beasts
> 
> Some of the beasts of the Bloodmire have adapted and become eerie approximations of their ancestors. You decide whether to use original or transfused versions of beasts on the Random Encounter table. These sickly, transfused creatures have an unearthly red glisten and have the following changes to their stat blocks:
> 
> - Their alignment becomes neutral evil y Their attacks deal necrotic damage instead of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.  
> - They are immune to the diseases described in the Bloodmire Diseases table.  
> - They can breathe under bloodwater.  
> - They understand infernal but cannot speak it. y They prioritize wounded prey when in combat, drawn to the fresh blood.

#### Example Settlements

Consider using these sample ideas as inspiration when building your own settlements within the Bloodmire.

- Jutting out of the swamp on bloodbark stilts and hanging from canopy treehouses, several small communities of odd halflings that work together in perfect sync to eke out a living near the edge of the Bloodmire. They work and trade with merchants and travelers that choose to enter the swamp and are strangely pleasant to speak to, despite the wary culture that pervades the swamp. The villagers are all Crimson Legion imps, disguised by one of their repurposed fey orbs, and continue to stockpile their wealth and supplies for when Malfuriel returns, allowing them to set off more readily on their path of conquest and destruction.  
- Various lashed-together dinghies and skimmers make up the brunt of this roving floating city of outlaws and brigands. The enhanced mobility enables them to make short work of those foolhardy travelers crossing the Bloodmire without proper protection.  
- After the tumult of war, famine, poor luck, or seeking respite from the law, a dozen scattered refugees have staked their tents on the few hills of muddy earth. They scrape by in equal parts due to their stubborn dedication and by sharing their collective resources.  
- Nestled amidst protective illusions and wards near the center of the Verdant Heart lies the last remaining bastion of the fey and all that remains of the old Syre Wood. A small village of honor-bound sprites dream of the beauty of the past, while fighting to keep their ancient war alive after all these years.  
- A sprawling network of constantly repaired treehouses and lashed rope lodge a coalition of reluctant werewolves trying to resist their curse. The Bloodmire seems to lessen the moon's effects and the pain of their transformation, and have a special bloodfern tea that helps control their cravings and rage.  

### Ruins And Dungeons

Due in large part to the murky, ever-shifting sludge of the Bloodmire's terrain, dungeons are far more likely to be ephemeral in nature as opposed to stone or rock caverns in the earth. Whether they be in the swamp's dense canopy above, the bloodwater and muck below, or in the ancient fey passageways that are only discoverable during unique lunar phases, the Bloodmire's secrets are revealed only to those with extraordinary persistence and skill.

When designing a Bloodmire dungeon, take special note of the humidity's eroding influence, and the incessant thrum of the swamp's beasts and insects. Make sure your players don't forget the oppressive weight of the Bloodmire's connection to mutant life and the stench of fresh, metallic death.

**Example Dungeons**

`dice: [[4 Part Iii Setting Options.md#^example-dungeons]]`

| dice: d6 | Example Dungeon |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Hidden and carefully guarded under the bloodwater of a Crimson Legion village is an alchemical laboratory that contains a stockpile of broken fey orbs. Careful investigation could reveal the history of these orbs as well as a way to disable them all for good. |
| 2 | A once-prominent fortress built by Syre and his warriors is now almost completely destroyed by plantlife, mud, and bloodwater. The sturdy, yet sunken walls are now home to a variety of monstrous amphibians, reptiles, and other beasts. Perhaps some carved hints about the Bloodmire's origin or ancient artifacts could be salvaged from the muck. |
| 3 | High in the canopy, a large number of giant mosquitoes have made a strange hive that's reminiscent of a wasp's nest. The local refugees weren't concerned about the hive until the insects started abducting children and other small adults. They suspect that the people stolen are being used to build, or possibly feed, something deep within the hive's labyrinthian tunnels. |
| 4 | One of the very few intact fey portals leads to Syre's hidden demiplane: a tower filled with magical traps, libraries, and fey heirlooms. Whether led there by sprites or found by chance, only the bravest adventurers would be capable of journeying to the end to find the mysterious treasure Syre left behind. However, even the few remaining sprites can't remember what it might be. |
| 5 | A fey portal has become corrupted by the Bloodmire's curses. Each new moon, the portal sparks to life and allows travel to a realm full of shades, dark magic, and terrors of the night. While it's open, this portal allows these strange nightmares to leak out and terrorize the swamp's inhabitants with otherworldly monsters. Unless someone can find a way to close the portal, the Bloodmire may fall completely under its sway. |
| 6 | Locating a roving camp of bandits in the Bloodmire takes a large amount of skill, as they've learned to use the mist, canopies, and bloodwater to hide from sight until the time to strike. Rumor tells that a group of these bandits have amassed a hoard of treasure somewhere in the Bloodmire that's filled with gold, goods, and supplies stolen from merchants who were either careless or desperate enough to travel through the swamp unprotected. |

### Example Treasure

When determining treasure for the Bloodmire, consider the denizens that live there. Items that are fey or fiendish in origin, such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bane Shield (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|bane shield]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Signet Rings Of The Fey Court (TGS1).md\|signet rings of the fey court]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Chain Devil Gloves (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|chain devil gloves]], are ideal. Similarly, items related to sickness and disease such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Carrion Shroud (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|carrion shroud]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Plaguebane Mask (TGS1).md\|plaguebane mask]] would be good fits. Of course, any item with "blood" or "bloodmire" in its name is perfect for this environment.

[[5. Mechanics/Items/Silverwind The Cleansing Breeze (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Silverwind, the Cleansing Breeze]] was the blade once wielded by Syre, the lord of the Syre Wood. It can be found within the Bloodmire piercing the petrified body of Malfuriel the Betrayer in the Verdant Heart. Its details can be found on page 200.
