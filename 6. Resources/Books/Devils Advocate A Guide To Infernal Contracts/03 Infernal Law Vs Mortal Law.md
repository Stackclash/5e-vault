# Infernal Law vs. Mortal Law
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 4* 

At first glance, the contracts written by devils bear striking similarities to their mortal counterparts. There are numerous parallels between infernal law and the legal system administered on the Material Plane. Arbitration, precedent, and the concept of the accused standing trial before a jury are all found in both the Nine Hells and various settlements in the Forgotten Realms. A popular Candlekeep theory holds that the first legislators were ancient devils in disguise. By sowing familiarity with their proceedings, these early fiends had more success procuring souls from future generations. Some scholars even believe that the charismatic Mephistopheles was one of Faerun's first lawyers.

However, conflating mortal and infernal law is a dangerous supposition. Devils have no moral code, and they only abide by *corpus juris infernis* ("the body of infernal law") and the archdevil that commands them. To the contract administrator, the ultimate goal is the procurement of the soul at its lowest possible cost. When a bearded devil jabs a rusty metal quill into the back of the creature serving as its inkwell, a soul is not special. It's not a unique ticket to the afterlife. Instead, it's a lifeless transaction. A quota to be met in hopes of future promotion. Fodder for a dusty hellfire engine that ran out of juice in Avernus. How could they possibly empathize with a signee? Devils are ruthless negotiators that only respect the letter of the law.

While some differences are obvious - killing is permitted in the Nine Hells, for example, so long as it's justifiable in the Diabolical Courts of Phlegethos - the true threat lies in more subtle departures from mortal law. For example, when two livinig creatures exchange goods, there is generally the assumption of competency, i.e., both sides must be mentally capable of understanding their agreement in order to consent. Although.consent must be present in an infernal contract, there is no requirement of competency. This fact creates a fine line that many devils gleefully walk, extending handshakes to nostalgic nobles on their deathbeds or offering lengthy scrolls to grief-stricken widows who can hardly process new information.
