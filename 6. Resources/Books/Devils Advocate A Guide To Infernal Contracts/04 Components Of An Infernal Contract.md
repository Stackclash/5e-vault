# Components of an Infernal Contract
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 4* 

While each contract is tailored to the signee by the drafter, few strict requirements must be met in for your contract to be legitimate. A proper, respected infernal contract includes five elements: Consideration, the Offer, Obligation, Fine Print, and Acceptance. However, many contracts contain additional clauses that further bind the signatory and/or contract administrator.

## Consideration

*"MY QUEEN WILL NOT REMEMBER ME?" WEPT Sir Faldsworth. Vreesar's white, chitinous mandibles separated with a clack, grinning at the sight of the fighters fallen companions. "No," whispered the ice devil, "you will not remember her."*

Consideration is a vital part of both mortal and infernal contract law that refers to the exchange of payment between two parties. Both the fiend and the mortal must incur some burden to have a valid contract. Otherwise, the offer is a gift, and devils don't give gifts - unless reciprocation is guaranteed. A variety of options for consideration exist, but the majority of contracts fall into exchanges of either life-years or souls.

### Life-Years

Contrary to popular belief, not every devil is a silver-tongued salesman capable of defrauding a signee of their soul. Many less-experienced devils earn a not-so-honest living by drafting cop.tracts based on life-years. These somewhat-standard agreements provide a framework from which lesser devils can slowly develop a sense of style, working in more clever fine print with each successful deal. In addition, trading life-years presents an opportunity for lesser fiends to chip away at mortals who may present an ongoing threat.

A creature that enters into an agreement based on life-years surrenders a portion of its remaining mortality to a fiend. This way, those with longer life spans (i.e., dwarves, elves, and giants) cannot benefit from an ancestral advantage. If the signee is fortunate, their life is cut short by a number of years equal to the number of life-years considered. However, the majority of life-year agreements stipulate that the signee must serve a fiend for that amount of time post mortem. In these cases, the drafter typically acts as an agent of an archdevil.

Upon death, the signee reports to the layer of the Nine Hells corresponding to the domain of the benefactor. The signee may perform menial tasks or hard labor as a slave, conduct or receive torture, or be enlisted as a soldier in the Blood War. Once this time is up, the soul is free to proceed t9 its original, intended destination unless the signee enters into additional agreements during that period. However, souls devoted to good deities may be surprised where they end up after dealing with devils!

To breed further deals, other devils make every effort to arrange a miserable existence forlife-year signees serving time in the Hells.

### Souls

The epitome of an infernal contract results in a pledge of the signee's soul as consideration. Souls are the currency of the Nine Hells. They are traded, converted into loyal subjects, and used to power infernal war machines. Souls of strong, good-natured mortals are especially coveted due to their bright potential. Contracts involving paladins and other holy warriors are often accompanied by the finest offers a devil can extend. Furthermore, a devil that regularly exceeds its soul quotas gets promoted. Every pit fiend was once a lowly chain devil who descended the fiery ladder of success.

### Other Forms of Consideration

Successful contract administrators are always thinking two or three steps ahead. They understand that most mortals are wary of entering into a contract with a devil given their reputation. A devil is usually content to make smaller, abstract deals with less-evident ramifications.

One classic example is requiring the voice of the signee for a single hour. The deal seems innocent at first, but it poses several questions. Will your voice be taken during combat, preventing you from casting spells with verbal components? Could the devil consent to an ancient prophecy on your behalf, sealing you to some strange fate? Will your voice be used in tandem with a disguise to damage a hard-earned relationship with a crucial ally? The subtleties of consideration in nontraditional forms can bring exciting dilemmas to your table. The [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Contract Consideration Da Gic.md\|Contract Consideration]] table presents a small sampling of such exchanges.

## The Offer

Ivy stared at her reflection in the temple window. "The years have not been kind," she lamented. If only she could return to her youth, knowing then what she knew now. "you won't find what youre looking for in there," answered a smooth voice.

A good offer can make or break an infernal contract. After all, it's not as if the River of Styx is backed up with masochistic passengers eagerly awaiting torment in the Nine Hells. The contract administrator - and by extension, the DM - is responsible for creating an offer so enticing that the signee doesn't realize they are getting the worse half of the deal. In contracts of the soul, the devil must suggest something to the signee that is genuinely priceless or unattainable.

### Constructing an Offer

When constructing your offer, don't be too critical of dangling something juicy in front of your players and their characters. Deals with devils should always be tempting, either because the requested consideration seems innocuous or because the offer is too good to pass up.

Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus provides a system for DMs to track ongoing deals of all sizes. By the end of the adventure, these sins may weigh down a character's soul and prevent them from leaving Avernus. The system outlined in this document attempts to establish a linear relationship between the offer and consideration while raising the stakes with each consecutive contract. The intent is to simultaneously convey the excitement and gravity of making deals with devils.

#### Suggested Offers by Life-Years

The Offers table gives examples of appropriate offers based on standard life-year agreements. The table mainly includes mechanical benefits designed to entice your players, and it is by no means exhaustive. An individual character's visions of grandeur are far too subjective to lay out all the possibilities. Your offers can - and should - be tailored to the player characters' desires and the weight of their sacrifices.

> [!note] Know Your Market
> 
> A soul's value is relative. While all devils are content to pocket another freshly-minted soul coin, some souls matter more to a particular benefactor than others. To Zariel at the forefront of the Blood War, the soul of a mighty warrior is highly-coveted for its potential as a warlord in her army. On the flip side, Mammon may pay twice the going rate for the soul of a wealthy entrepreneur whose acumen could boost the hoards of Minauros. If you're going to sell your soul, you might as well request an agent of the appropriate archdevil and avoid potential lowball offers.

##### Using the Offers Table

To choose an appropriate offer, start by identifying the percentage of remaining life-years that the signee is putting up for consideration. Then, locate the corresponding service tier. For example, if a signee gives up half of their remaining life span, they are entitled to service tier II. Once you have selected your service tier, work with your DM or contract administrator to choose an appropriate offer. Alternatively, you may have an offer in mind and choose to work backward. [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Infernal Ally Da Gic.md\|Infernal Ally]] rules are located in Appendix C.

##### Other Forms of Consideration

If desired, the DM or the player may select a different form of consideration than years of remaining life, such as the ones outlined in the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Contract Consideration Da Gic.md\|Contract Consideration]] table. In these cases, use your best judgment to choose an appropriate service tier and offer. If the signee's consideration is the memory of a loved one, you might choose the service tier corresponding to half the life-years that they knew this person.

##### Desperate vs. Confident

A signee that is making an offer in a pinch (see "Sealing the Deal") is said to be a desperate signee. A proactive signee who isn't in the heat of the moment is known as a confident signee. The [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Offers Da Gic.md\|Offers]] table distinguishes between immediate, one-time assistance and long-lasting benefits for desperate and confident signees, respectively. However, these two distinctions are only suggestions. A signee may choose from either column when making a deal.

^end-of-the-line

### Making Subsequent Deals

A player character can sign their first contract at any service tier. However, subsequent deals come at a higher price. If a character has already signed an infernal contract, the following deal must be of a higher service tier than the previous one - inevitably pushing them towards a soul contract. While this may seem grim, this prevents the player character from repeating negligible transactions with little consequence. Additionally, it entitles the signee to a better offer than their previous contract.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Offers Da Gic.md\|Offers]]

## Obligation

> [!quote] A quote from Mordenkainen  
> 
> Devils hide behind their laws as if their order is just. In truth, there are no 'fair' exchanges with devils. There are only foolish pacts in which a mortal has taken their payment for granted.

In a contract, an obligation is the legal duty of the two parties to perform. The signee and the contract administrator are bound by its terms. If either party violates this ironclad agreement, they may face harsh punishment according to infernal law. Such violations are overseen by Belial and his dispassionate judges in the Diabolical Courts of Phlegethos, the fourth layer of the Nine Hells.

For a mortal who hasn't yet signed away their soul, a sentence coming from the Diabolical Courts carries a terrifying prospect. However, a soulless mortal may wonder what more could come from a breach of contract. Quite a bit, actually. Devils are incredibly creative when·it comes to torture, and few things delight them as much as tormenting the guilty.

When devils break infernal law, the punishment is more severe. Higher-ranking devils are capable of demoting those beneath them, forcing them to squirm and shuffle as larva-like lemures for a few centuries. In some instances, the offender's soul may be consumed, destroying it forever. The ultimate form of discipline for devils who break their contracts is an item granted to Asmodeus by Primus known as the Ruby Rod. There is no record of the punishment administered by Asmodeus through the Ruby Rod, but it is chilling to imagine a fate that frightens even the most ruthless of fiends.

> [!quote]  
> 
> I'm a little fuzzy on obligation. It boils down to this: You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. Really, really hard.

## Fine Print

> [!quote] A quote from Tessele Whitehorn  
> 
> Read it twice. Give it another look, this time with a jeweler's loupe. Apply divination magic liberally, searching for hidden scripts or glyphs. Finally, crumple it up and walk away. vWiat on earth were you thinking?

The fine print is a classic and necessary component of an infernal contract, dating all the way back to the Pact Primeval. Devils recognize the inherent suspicion that accompanies their dealings. If anyone truly understood the ramifications of such agreements, no one would ever agree to sign an infernal contract. As a result, devils must entice others with wild temptations and shroud their unfavorable intentions behind inconspicuous details.

> [!note] Get It in Writing
> 
> A devil is never offended when a signee requests the entirety of the agreement in writing. In fact, it's often the first indication that the signee means serious business. There are hundreds of sour souls that wound up in the Nine Hells becuase they never saw the terms of agreement (especially the offer and consideration) spelled out in writing. Some devilish salesmen default to the written agreement. This provides a false sense of security to some signees, almost as if the devil is looking out for them.

### Tricking the Character vs. Cheating the Player

Dungeon Masters should root for their players as the protagonists of the narrative, celebrating success and good storytelling. Most adventurers are not gullible; while a player may gloss over certain aspects of an infernal contract, their character has been hardened by their journey. You may have more success by emphasizing these agreements as roleplay opportunities, rather than traps or puzzles. While the latter may engage a player temporarily, the former can deepen a player's investment in the campaign.

### Scrutinizing a Contract

When you introduce an infernal contract to your table, you may wish to institute a series of ability checks to examine the document for any fine print. A challenge such as this is an excellent excuse for a character to show off their Proficiencies in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma-based ability checks. If the signee is lacking in these areas, it's a good opportunity to share the spotlight and emphasize teamwork. Below are a few skills and their suggested uses in discovering fine print when a character is examining an infernal contract. You can reference the Difficulty Class by Level table for guidance on setting appropriate DCs for these checks and choosing the type of devil to extend a contract.

**Difficulty Class by Level**

| Level | Contract Administrator | Difficulty Class |
|-------|------------------------|------------------|
| 1-4 | Horned Devil | 15 |
| 5-8 | Erinyes | 17 |
| 9-12 | Ice Devil | 19 |
| 13-164 | Pit Fiend | 22 |
| 17-20 | Duke or Archdevil | 25+ |
^difficulty-class-by-level

- ***Arcana.*** Decipher glyphs or enchantments on a contract. Recall planar lore related to the Nine Hells and its inhabitants.  
- ***History.*** Recall lore related to historical events such as the Blood War. Evaluate the credibility of the document by comparing it to mortal contract law.  
- ***Investigation.*** Make deductions related to the document. Translate confusing statements, assess the legitimacy of specific claims, and apply logic and reason to its terms.  
- ***Religion.*** Recall lore about important deities and powerful archdevils, such as Asmodeus or Zariel. This skill may also be used to translate infernal symbols or recognize signs of the occult.  

- ***Insight.*** Analyze devilish social cues. Determine the true intentions of the devil with your consideration. Catch the fiend when it tries to stretch the truth.  
- ***Perception.*** Spot physical hidden details such as small print. Eavesdrop on minions or other spectators discussing pitfalls in the deal.  

- ***Deception.*** Lie to a devil or hide your true feelings about a deal. Note that some fiends are immune to such trickery.  
- ***Intimidation.*** Attempt to coerce a devil or its minions to rethink their terms.  
- ***Performance.*** Put on a show, or pretend to walk away. Whichever gets you a better offer.  
- ***Persuasion.*** Convince a devil through respect or proper infernal etiquette.

### Incorporating Fine Print

Locating fine print on a physical document can be an exhilarating experience for your players. Some may become paranoid upon seeing legal jargon or infernal embellishments, while others might meticulously review each phrase contained within the document. Fine print encourages participation from the entire party, whether it's through social interaction, ability checks, or marking up a physical document. The [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Fine Print Da Gic.md\|Fine Print]] table presents examples of fine print that may be found in an infernal contract. Remember to be cautious when incorporating fine print into a physical document. There is a thin line between the satisfying "Ah-ha!" moment of locating fine print and frustrating or even antagonizing a player who feels as if, the expectations weren't clear. If your players don't locate a particular string of fine print, consider saving it for a future instance where the contract is dramatically reproduced for your players. Alternatively, you may choose to ignore it entirely in the interest of preserving the moment.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Fine Print Da Gic.md\|Fine Print]]

## Acceptance

> [!quote] A quote from Asmodeus  
> 
> No being has ever been forced to sign a contract of mine. Every signee has willingly agreed to abide by the terms therein, which I subsequently enforced with absolute precision.

No contract is complete without acceptance. Regardless of all the tantalizing offers and sinister tricks that a devil may use to entice the signee, it cannot force an agreement. Just like any mortal contract, both parties reserve the right to walk away if they are not satisfied enough to sign.

### Sealing the Deal

Not all contracts have signature lines. The drafter reserves the right to determine the method of the agreement once all is said and done, though this must be stated in the contract. For example, a succubus or incubus may seal their deals with a kiss rather than a pen and parchment. The [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Devil Clinches Da Gic.md\|Devil Clinches]] table presents a few additional options to finalize your infernal contracts with hellish flavor.

#### Signing a Contract

Signing a contract takes no time whatsoever. In times of dire need, the deal occurs in the blink of an eye, regardless of the amount of time spent deliberating. That said, stalling is a common occurrence for both parties when the need for a contract is less-immediate. If this is not the signee's first infernal agreement, they must choose a higher service tier than their previous contract. While this confers an additional benefit, the cost of subsequent bargains weighs on the signee's soul - if they still have one.

> 
> I'm old fashioned. It's gotta be blood. I don't care whose, but it's blood or no deal.

## Supplementary Clauses

> [!quote] A quote from Mephistopheles  
> 
> The eyes of mortals tire easily. Clause or two at the end that complicates the agreement. Once you've worn them down, put a pen in their hand.

Many contracts contain supplementary clauses apart fromthe five standard components. Clever signees employ suchclauses to reign in dubious statements and other liabilities. Conversely, the drafter may include additional sections todisorient the signee further and ensure that the deal tips inthe devil's favor.

### Breach of Contract

Pacts of the Nine Hells are ghastly personifications of their earthly counterparts. Similar to mortal arrangements, a breach occurs when either party fails to uphold their agreed-upon duties. Perhaps the signee's soul was somehow tainted at time of collection, or the offer provided by the fiend did not match the original description. The most common form of a contractual breach is attempting to avoid collection.

Signees that clarify a supplementary clause should proceed with caution. If they have not given the contract a proper inspection before marking it up, the signee may weaken their position. Keeping the agreement vague may seem like a bad idea, but if a breach of contract becomes a case in the Diabolical Courts, leaving a clause open to interpretation could be your ticket to freedom.

### Collateral

When one party fails to honor their obligation, the other party may be entitled to the additional property. Collateral is specified during the drafting process as a protection against risk. For example, the contract administrator states that the signee's soul must be of equal or greater purity as when the agreement was signed. They then stipulate that if this requirement is not met at the time of collection, it will result in the surrender of collateral, such the signee's land or family name.

Collateral can be in favor of either the contract administrator or the signee. One clever halfling by the name of Dren Thistle foot snuck in a clause stating that the true name of the contract administrator would be revealed in the event of a contractual breach. The administrator gladly signed, knowing that it would never violate infernal law. What the devil missed was that Thistlefoot tied this collateral to both parties - regardless of who was at fault for said breach. When Thistlefoot violated his agreement, he cheerfully spoke the devil's name and commanded it to nullify the entire agreement.

### Damages

Damages are the punitive consequences of breaching of contract. A common repercussion is to demand additional payment from the offending party. Because few contracts deal in dollars and cents, a signee who violates their agreement may find that their original consideration no longer suffices. One precious memory becomes two. Instead of taking your voice for an hour, the devil may take it forever, rendering you mute. In cases of soul contracts, the administrator could cut the signee's life short, collect any collateral to which the signee previously agreed, or convert them to a wretched lemure on the spot. Damages, unless explicitly outlined in the contract, are decided by Belial or another high-ranking fiend in the Diabolical Courts of Phlegethos. Punishment is carried out in the appropriate layer.

### Cancellation

A cancellation clause provides terms for nullification of the contract as a whole. Few reasons exist for a devil to include such an exit, but occasionally, these clauses do make it into the final contract. Because they are heavily in favor of the signee, cancellation clauses are airtight. An experienced drafter abolishes all traces of interpretation that could result in the signee dodging their agreement.

### Noncompete

Devils live in a constant state of uncertainty. A devil fears two things: rebellion from lower-ranking conspirators and retaliation from those above. Because of this, the drafter may indulge its suspicion and include a noncompete clause, stating that the signee cannot pursue overlapping agreements with other archdevils or mighty beings. For this reason, contract administrators are wary of extending contracts to warlocks, and any devil worth their weight in sulfur will ask to see the details of any existing pacts. Contrary to its mortal counterpart, infernal arbitration is anything but a dull affair. However, it is still a lengthy process, and the contract administrator would rather spend that time meeting its soul quotas.

### Nondisclosure

A devil may require the signee to keep certain details of the contract secret. A nondisclosure clause guards sensitive information against those who might interfere or otherwise annoy the devil who wrote it. Additionally, a devil may benefit from damaging a relationship between the signee and other celestials, fiends, or party members.
