# Roleplaying Infernal Contracts
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 16* 

It takes two parties to form a contract. While the DM creates and presents these hellish agreements, it is the player's job to interact with them. Adventurers propose or agree on the consideration. They negotiate with the contract administrator for an appropriate offer, examine the fine print, and make physical alterations to the document when theyâ€¢discover questionable statements. Ultimately, the player and their character can choose to refuse the contract in its entirety.

## "But What's My Motivation?"

Character alignment has become a hotly-contested subject in recent years. Some players use it as justification to perform an act that might upset the other players, such as stealing from a party member. Someone playing a Lawful Good paladin may treat alignment as a way to keep the party to alignment when a decision would have a considerable impact on their character's arc or the campaign. For a great reference on how a character of a particular alignment might act, I recommend easydamus.com.

No matter how you see them, alignments - along with bonds, ideals, and flaws - serve as a reference to how your character may act in a given circumstance. However, no character acts in accordance with their alignment one hundred percent of the time. Due to the limitless nature of the offer, infernal contracts can pose moral quandaries to all characters.

### Good vs. Evil

Good characters enter into infernal contracts for the greater good. Although infernal law is inherently evil, a character may sign if the offer facilitates an honorable pursuit, such as the whereabouts of a holy weapon. Good characters make sacrifices all the time in the interest of protecting innocent lives, but it doesn't stop the deal from leaving an unpleasant taste in their mouth.

Evil characters, on the other hand, have no qualms signing on the dotted line. Having little sympathy for others, they are more inclined when a deal doesn't impact their wellbeing. In the end, these adventurers would rather save their soul for a god aligned with their interests.

### Law vs. Chaos

Lawful characters don't immediately conform to every law. In fact, it's impossible. No two nations or even neighboring kingdoms share every law. To these characters, "law" represents a personal code, such as always respecting a just monarch or never killing a creature that surrenders.

Chaotic characters are uncomfortable with rigid contractual obligations. A sizeable amount of collection efforts are targeted at these individuals. Chaotic characters dance to their tune, and they will sign if it's in their best interests - or at least if it appears so.

### Paladins, Clerics, and Other Lawful Good Characters

While paladins have no qualms being beholden to a code, infernal law is inherently evil and almost certainly against the tenets by which they live. The same goes for clerics devoted to a good god, such as Ilmater or Lathander. Signing a deal with a devil could result in broken oaths or losing the divine magic granted to the character by their god. However, a lawful good character - and possibly their deity- may justify an infernal bargain if it can subvert an unavoidable disaster, save the lives of innocent creatures, or restore balance to the cosmos.

## Losing Your Soul

A contract that results in an adventurer's soul is a laudable achievement to the contract administrator, but the signee is often left feeling bitter in the hours following the deal. After the initial reaction wears off, what impact does losing your soul have? Did you bring dishonor to your tribe or monastic order, preventing you from returning home? How did your bargain impact long-term goals, hopes, and dreams? Work with your DM or use the Character Outlook table to inspire your character's attitude following this hellish agreement.
