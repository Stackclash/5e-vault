# The First Contract
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 4* 

The first example of infernal law predates the Nine Hells themselves. As an angel, Asmodeus convinced the gods that their creations would only heed divine law if there were something to dissuade them from disobedience. Mortal creatures would then have the choice between upholding the word of the gods and Asmodeus's harsh alternative - punishment. After much deliberation, a lengthy decree was drafted by Asmodeus and agreed upon by the gods. It was called the Pact Primeval, the First Contract.

The Pact Primeval granted Asmodeus and his allies dominion over the then-abandoned realm of Baator, which would eventually become the Nine Hells. It also established a procedure for the punishment of the wicked souls destined for its layers. However, over time, the gods found that a decreasing number of souls reached the Upper Planes because Asmodeus and his devils were deliberately tempting them. When the gods disputed the First Contract, claiming that Asmodeus had violated its terms, he dispassionately replied, "Read the fine print." In addition to the Pact Primeval located in the Nine Hells, there are two other copies of the contract. One is housed on Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of Goodness and Law. The other is located on the clockwork plane of law, Mechanus.
