# Writing Your Infernal Contract
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 18* 

Unveiling your first infernal contract should be an exciting experience for the entire table. Even characters with low Intelligence scores suspect foul play when it comes to signing away years of their life, and the rest of the party is sure to take notice. Players can help the signee through this process since their characters wouldn't sit idly by while a devil works them over. While later agreements may proceed more quickly to avoid sluggish pacing at your table, consider enhancing the experience by providing a physical prop for your players' enjoyment.

## Drafting a Devilish Document

Creating a prop contract for your table is no small feat. While popular media includes countless instances of courtroom drama, examples of contracts are far and few in between. Here is a suggested process for using this document to create your infernal contract.

- ***Determine the Signee.*** Is your contract more general, or do you plan to create a contract for a specific character? If you know who the contract is for, you may be able to work with the player to better tailor the contract to their character's desires. Conversely, a generic contract may contain blank sections that are filled in when it's administered.  
- ***Contract Administrator.*** The Difficulty Class by Level table gives suggested devil types based on average party level (APL) to extend contracts to the party. You could create your contract administrator or choose an existing devil from your campaign.  
- ***Consideration.*** It's easier to write a contract if you know what will be exchanged on behalf of the signee. What is the character likely to surrender? Does the contract administrator already have something in mind? Is it life-years, a soul, or something else? You can use the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Contract Consideration Da Gic.md\|Contract Consideration]] table for inspiration on other forms of payment.  
- ***The Offer.*** List out a few possible offers, unless you know exactly what the devil will be offering the signee. You can use the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Offers Da Gic.md\|Offers]] table to formulate an appropriate offer for different service tiers. You may want to leave this section blank in your prop.  
- ***Fine Print.*** Decide the nature of the fine print that you will include and how the players will discover it - through ability checks, social interaction, or examining your prop contract. The Fine Print table contains some examples.  
- ***Supplementary Clauses.*** Will you incorporate additional clauses such as breach of contract, collateral, or nullification?  
- ***Agreement.*** Determine the devil's preferred method for sealing the deal. The [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Devil Clinches Da Gic.md\|Devil Clinches]] table contains some examples. I recommend including a signature line for your player to sign as their character regardless of which clinch you choose.  
- ***Infernal Embellishments.*** The following section contains tables for additional flairs, such as devil quirks and legal phrases.  

## Infernal Embellishments

You can use the following tables to introduce some damnable flair into your infernal contract. Appendix B contains six infernal symbols to insert into your accursed pact. For an example of a simple infernal contract - either to administer to your players or to inspire further atrocities - see Appendix D.

| 1 | an epitaph inside icy catacombs somewhere in Stygia. Is the chamber meant for you? |
| 2 | carved into the bark of a black tree that sprouts whenever the devil plants a seed. The fine print is written on its leaves. |
| 3 | a pan of baklava that always smells pleasant. Its 3 filo dough pages replenish every `dice:1d6\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`d6`) minutes and induce severe diarrhea when consumed. |
| 4 | inside of a chalice filled with sentient sludge. The words form on its surface but disappear with a jiggle when touched. |
| 5 | a shell from the shores of the River of Styx. Your contract emanates as a whisper when you put it to your ear. |
| 6 | woven into a sweater knitted by an ancient hag. |
