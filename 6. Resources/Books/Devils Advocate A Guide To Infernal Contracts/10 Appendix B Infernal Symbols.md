# Appendix B: Infernal Symbols
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 22* 

These 6 infernal symbols can be placed to embellish your finished contract. They have no established meaning, though you can use that to your advantage. Perhaps they present a possible way to escape the ironclad agreement, such as the devil's true name or something they value. They could provide a link to a specific location or NPC by serving as the insignia of an infernal biker gang with six-wheeled contraptions. Maybe they are there to intimidate your characters by signifying that there will always be a degree of uncertainty to these types of agreements.
