# Preface
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 3* 

Devils have a long-running history in *Dungeons & Dragons*. They first appeared alongside their demonic counterparts in the original *Monster Manual* in 1977, possibly fueling the religious objections to D&D during the 1980s. Nevertheless, the world's greatest roleplaying game survived this moral panic, and fiends have been an important part of the hobby ever since. Just last year, "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes" delved into the eternal struggle between devils and demons known as the Blood War, and this September will see the release of a hellscape-themed adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus.

Despite the pervasive history of devils in D&D, there is little in the way of official resources on the details of infernal contracts. There is a wealth of reference material surrounding the lore, hierarchy, and nature of devils, but there's not much information for DMs and players to create infernal contracts of their own. I wrote *Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts* to remedy this discrepancy. I hope that once you've finished reading this document, you'll:

- Know some lore surrounding the laws of devils.  
- Understand the components of an infernal contract and the nuances of constructing an offer.  
- Have some handy tools for storytelling and role play surrounding bargains and their consequences.  
- Be able to present a prop infernal contract to your table.  

## General Contractual Terms

Throughout this supplement, I use several legal terms. For clarification, the creature that signs a contract may be referred to as the **signatory** or **signee**. The devil that writes an infernal contract is known as the **drafter**. I refer to the party that extends a contract and its associated offer as the **contract administrator**. Most of the time, the contract administrator and the drafter are the same devil. A contract may be drafted and/or administered on behalf of a duke or archdevil. In that case, the devil extending the contract is acting as an **agent** of the higher-ranking fiend, who may be referred to as a **benefactor**.

### Disclaimer

Although my name is Justice, I am not a lawyer. To the D&D player or Dungeon Master reading this document with a legal background, you may find inaccuracies with my portrayal of contract law. I commend you on your studies. Thank you for supporting this product despite its shortcomings.
