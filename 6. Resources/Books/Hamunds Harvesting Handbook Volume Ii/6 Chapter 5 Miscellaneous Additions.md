# Chapter 5: Miscellaneous Additions
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II, p. 67* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Harvesting is a holistic art. It is not simply the physical act of cutting and slicing through a carcass, it is the tools you use, the rules you live by and the skills you have; in short it is an entire lifestyle! Once you have assumed the life of a harvester, you will see the world in a different way, and find the new possibilities and options open to you. However, in the case that you haven't, I've listed them down here for you anyway.

This guide introduces a few new concepts into the base game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and as part of that, a few slight alterations and/or additions need to be made to existing concepts and features in the game to accommodate them. While some of these changes are not strictly necessary for this guide to be used, they are advised in order to get the maximum value out of this book.

## Special Tools

A few new pieces of adventuring gear have been added in this book to accommodate the act of harvesting. Their functions are described below:

### New Spells

> Having preferred the hands-on approach, I never had much of an affinity for magic myself. However, one must always endeavour to expand one's horizons, so I have scoured the planes looking for spells to bolster my (already impressive) skills. The result is the following spells, curated from the minds of the greatest witch-doctors, soothsayers, and magic-men that I have encountered on my travels.

A few new spells have been added to the game. Each one either aids with harvesting, or has harvesting as a core mechanic. In many cases, the spells have uses in both combat and in harvesting, making them especially versatile. Feel free to add any of them to your own game to support your players' harvesting fantasies.

## Hamund's Helpers

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Despite the rugged independent aesthetic that I exude, I must assure you that harvesting is not a solitary profession! What we do as harvesters is simply the first step in a long chain of commerce and industry, without which, our work would be meaningless. In my career, I have established a long list of faithful contacts and friends that I refer to as my "Helpers." Without them, I would merely be a random man slicing animals open in the wilderness! I pass their information on to you, my dear readers, with my reassurance that their services are second to none. All I ask is that if you find them and engage their services, let them know that Hamund sent you.

The following are a list of NPC crafters that a DM can easily slot into any campaign or setting. Feel free to use these NPCs as convenient ways for the party to craft their harvested materials into useful items, vendors to buy spare materials, or even quest givers for certain monster parts.

### Craftables Vendor

**Name.** Whisper  
**Race.** ???  
**Hamund's Notes.** I have known Whisper for some time now, however I still know very little about her; mostly due to her living up to her name and being almost impossible to hold a proper conversation with. I still do not know what race she is, where she is travelling, or if that is even her true face or simply a mask.  

    What I do know is that she carries on her back an amazing assortment of magical items, all of them crafted from creatures, and all of them for sale. Where she got all of these items is yet another mystery, as is the fact that her inventory always seems to have the exact item that you are looking for. Now, as enticing as all that would be, I must highly advise those of you with sticky fingers to behave yourselves around her. After all, if those powerful magical items are the ones she's willing to get rid of, what kind of power do you think she keeps for herself?

### Fixer

**Name.** Alanna Domine  
**Race.** Human  
**Hamund's Notes.** Alanna has always intimately known the power of words. Born into poverty and growing up amongst pickpockets, Alanna relied more on the speed of her wit than on the speed of her fingers to survive. A rumour here, the right piece of information there, and an intercepted letter or two; these were the blocks upon which Alanna built a fixing and information brokering empire.  

    Today, Alanna describes her job as being very simple: she gets the right people to talk to each other. In exchange for a small fee, she will get prospective clients in contact with mercenaries willing to do whatever job necessary. For us harvesters, this means a steady supply of work harvesting rare materials for anyone with the coin to pay for it. If you are looking to pick up a little extra spending money, just start asking around for Alanna. She's sure to pop out of the shadows soon enough, with a laundry list of materials for you to find, and all at a premium rate.

### Master Crafter

**Name.** Orryn Folkor  
**Race.** Gnome  
**Hamund's Notes.** I have known Orryn since we were children, and I regard him as both one of my closest friends and one of the sharpest minds in existence. I recall Orryn being a particularly sensitive boy, often relying on me to fend off bullies and tormentors for him. Still, he was exceptionally bright, taking a keen interest in all sorts of magic and research. As I honed my harvesting skills, he would hone his crafting skills. He would create something wondrous out of the materials I gave him, and it is thanks to him that I am even aware of half the craftables included in this book. No trade is beyond his talents as a polymath, and he is seemingly able to work with anything you give him.  

    Today, Orryn wanders much like I do, seeking out new materials to whet his interests and creativity. If you find him, simply mention my name and he is sure to help you with whatever item you wish to craft.

### Supplier

**Name.** Sellek (Translation: Hunter)  
**Race.** Lizardfolk  
**Hamund's Notes.** Honestly, I am still a little wary around Sellek. It is rare to find a lizardfolk outside of their swamp villages, and even rarer to find one such as Sellek who seems so comfortable, and perhaps even happy, to live among warm blooded humanoids. I can only conclude that Sellek is at least partially crazy, which is saying a lot when it comes to lizardfolk.  

    Despite that, Sellek is one of the finest hunters I have ever seen, bolstered by the high-quality tools that he designed and made himself. Harvesters come from all around, seeking to buy his superior quality traps, bags, and equipment. If there is anything you need for your harvesting adventures, be sure to seek Sellek out for the finest selection of equipment.  

    Just try to avoid eye contact with him when you do.

### Trapper

**Name.** Rangrim Holderhek  
**Race.** Dwarf  
**Hamund's Notes.** Yet another of the Holderhek clan included in my book, this time my nephew: Rangrim. The lad has never been an easy one to work with; due to having a temper fierier than his hair. After countless disagreements and fights with the clan elders, the last straw came when he was forced to choose between the bear cub he found or his place in the clan. For Rangrim, the choice was easy.  

    He now roams the wilds as a hunter and harvester, always followed by his precious bear partner: Lodinn. While he is not quite on the same level of harvesting skill as his dear old uncle, his brash stubbornness seems to have granted him a better head for business. If you spot him in the open or in town, feel free to approach him and barter for harvesting materials. Rangrim never seems to run out of space in his many bags and pouches, and you will find him to be an honest vendor to offer you coin for your excess stock. Be warned though to never cheat him, or you will find out just how well trained Lodinn really is.
