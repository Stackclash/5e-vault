# FAQs
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II, p. 149* 

*Q: Why didn't you include the meat you can harvest from creatures?*

A: I wanted to avoid relatively generic harvesting materials. Largely I assumed that DM's would be able to judge meat harvesting by themselves without any need for a guide.

*Q: Can I give suggestions or feedback?*

A: Of course! This is a living document and I fully endorse anyone to send in item suggestions or balance feedback. See the Contact Us section for contact details.

*Q: Can I change an item to suit my campaign?*

A: Feel free to do so. Items were designed to be setting agnostic and able to fit into anything, but edge cases could always occur. I encourage DMs to use this guide as a launching point for their own ideas.

*Q: Will you be making a follow-up for "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes"?*

A: Yes I am. Follow @drifterworkshop (https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop) on Twitter for regular updates. > [!note]
> See Hamund's Harvesting Handbook III ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook III.json]

*Q: How do your rules fit in with the newly released Artificer class on Unearthed Arcana?*

A: To be honest, they do not. The updated Artificer class was released very late into the development of this guide and as such, this guide does not incoporate them at all. A future update may attempt to reconcile them.

*Q: Why don't you include the beast section?*

A: I felt that beasts were too mundane to include in the harvest table, and largely could be replaced by a DM googling an actual butcher table.

*Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armor?*

A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Hobgoblin.md\|Hobgoblin]] walks around with a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spear]] at all times, so I felt best to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context.
