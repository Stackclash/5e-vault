# Chapter 6: Hamund's Have-Nots
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II, p. 72* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I have been an adventurer for as long as I have been a harvester. As part of that, I have met a myriad of people from all over the multiverse, many of whom have asked for my help and expertise on whatever problems may plague them. Unfortunately, I am but one person, and do not have the resources to help everyone. Instead, I have done the next best thing: write down their details to outsource these quests to my readers! If you are in the altruistic mood (or just in the need for some extra coin), consider lending someone in here a hand.

The following is a list of quests featuring every single monster from the "Monster Manual" and "Volo's Guide to Monsters". The aim is to provide a quick quest or incentive for Dungeon Masters to throw to their players, or to give an extra incentive to hunt down a particular monster.

## Understanding the Board

The following is a basic rundown of how to read and use the quest board. The quest board is designed to be used on the fly by Dungeon Masters, and groups are encouraged to adapt these to their own tables.

### CR

All quests are separated out by Challenge Rating in ascending order and then in alphabetical order based on the target. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to look up a Challenge Rating appropriate for their party and then to pick a target appropriate for their current environment.

### Target

This lists the creature to be hunted in the quest, listed in alphabetical order.

### Request

This is the harvesting material being asked for by the quest giver. More often than not, a material with no explicit mechanical use has been chosen for the request. This is so that players do not have to choose between completing a quest, and keeping the material for themselves to use.

Many quests also allow the players to supply the requested material more than once, getting an additional bounty each time.

### Requester Name

The name of the quest giver. Feel free to change the names to suit your own game. Also note that some quest givers appear more than once, often asking for similar items or to achieve similar goals. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to use these as NPCs in their own game or adapt them as they need.

### Race

The race of the quest giver. Most races chosen are from the "Player's Handbook", and especially from the "main" races of [[5. Mechanics/Races/Human.md\|Human]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Elf.md\|Elf]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Dwarf.md\|Dwarf]], and [[5. Mechanics/Races/Halfling.md\|Halfling]]. This was in order to make them as adaptable to individual tables as possible. That said, some esoteric races also appear such as [[5. Mechanics/Races/Tiefling.md\|Tiefling]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Goliath.md\|Goliath]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Tabaxi.md\|Tabaxi]], etc. If any of these contradict your own games, you are encouraged to adapt them to your own table. All included races appear in either the "Player's Handbook" or in "Volo's Guide to Monsters".

### Suggested Locations

The environment that the target is often found in. Use this to help determine if a quest is appropriate, given your party's current location. The possible environments are as follows:

- Arctic  
- Cave  
- Coast  
- Desert  
- Forest  
- General  
- Grassland  
- Mountain  
- Swamp  
- Urban  

"General" denotes that the creature can appear in any environment.

### Description

A brief explanation of the requirements of the quest, and the motivation of the quest giver in asking for the material. While the "Description" of the quest is designed to be read verbatim by a present NPC, they may also be included as written notices on a job board, or simply used as inspiration for the Dungeon Master to interpret to fit their own campaigns.

Occasionally, the motivation for retrieving a material may be at odds with the personality of the party. In these cases, the Dungeon Master may feel free to either change the motivation, or to incorporate it into their actual campaign. As always, information in this book is intended to be used to support the play-style of the individual table, and groups are encouraged to adapt it to their own games.

### Reward

The bounty given to the players for successfully retrieving the requested material. This amount is usually 1.5× the normal price of the material. The price is given per request delivered. For example, Ander Greenbottle asks for "Blight Seeds ×5" and the reward is listed as "1 gold piece." This mean that he will pay 1 gold piece for all 5 Blight Seeds, not one 1 gold piece per Blight Seed.

However, many quests offer the option for the players to submit the request more than once. This is not explicitly stated, but it is implied in the description of the quest. In such cases, the players may receive the same reward each time they hand in the requested material.

I have heard of race of bird people known as Aarakocra whose feathers should be big enough to convince him of my prowess. All I need is a few to shove in his face so that I can save mine.

I just hope it don't change the taste of my pumpkins too bad.

Most of my samples of illithid experiments come from humanoids like grimlocks and duergar, so you can imagine how interesting it is to see illithid influence on the simple brain of a beast. The way their feral instincts interacts with psionic control is fascinating, and I simply cannot have enough samples. If you can bring them back in one piece, I will gladly pay you for each brain you can find.

I've heard that a set of dice crafted from a hand touched by necromancy can help me out in that regard.

I'd like a chance to listen to their music, and the only way I can see that happening is if I get some magical assistance. I've been told that a magic hearing horn can be crafted from the otolith of a darkmantle, if someone would just be kind enough to get me one.

The best source of it comes from oozes: they're plentiful, potent, and if you leave it long enough it starts to reproduce itself. That said, I'll take any samples you have, I've always got more projects than I have materials for.

To be honest, the night's a little hazy, but apparently in the middle of it all I had challenged the biggest grognard in town to a duel. Now I'm not much of a fighting man myself, so I will most definitely die in that duel without some outside help. Unfortunately, I'm also a bit strapped for cash, so the only thing I can think of that I can also afford is some orc blood. One sip of that stuff can turn any man into a raging fighting machine...at least for a little while.

The problem is that some of our warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise they've been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely. Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens that kill eggs as soon as they're implanted.

We all had a quick laugh at first, but that turned to awe as the teeth began to actually devour a sausage that he had placed in front of it. Not only that, but he could taste it as well, and the food actually ended up in his real stomach! Imagine how fast I could eat with a set of those teeth! I could lay claim to half the dinner spread by myself! I need to make those teeth for myself, even if it does come with the risk of a fiendish curse.

To be honest, the night's a little hazy, but apparently in the middle of it all I had challenged the biggest grognard in town to a duel. Now I'm not much of a fighting man myself, so I will most definitely die in that duel without some outside help. Unfortunately, I'm also a bit strapped for cash, so the only thing I can think of that I can also afford is some orc blood. One sip of that stuff can turn any man into a raging fighting machine...at least for a little while.

The damn boy has an obnoxious habit of using his magic to play pranks on us: yesterday, he turned poor Corrin into a squirrel for no reason! I want to forge a Shield of Reflection to take him down a notch. I'd happily pay all of my adventuring gold just to see his face when his next spell goes flying back at him.

I'm always looking for ways to make sure that they stay out of trouble, and one of the best ways is to make sure they aren't even seen. It would be extremely expensive for me to commission a bunch of invisibility items (certainly much more than my employees are worth) so I'll have to go with some camouflage instead. The hide of a trapper would be good, and I'll even pay a premium if you can get it to me... discreetly.

Problem is, there's this one fighter that's been dominating the competition lately; it's made the shows a little boring to be honest. What I want to do is put a handicap on him. He's already agreed to it, we just need something that can do it without restraining him too hard. I think a minor curse should help out, something to sap his strength without making him look too weak. I've got a tiefling buddy that can whip up something like that, they say they just need a couple of eyes from some demon. Do that for me, and you're in for a good reward AND front row tickets.

Now I'm not much of a fighting man myself, so I will most definitely die in that duel without some outside help. Unfortunately, I'm also a bit strapped for cash, so the only thing I can think of that I can also afford is some orc blood. One sip of that stuff can turn any man into a raging fighting machine...at least for a little while.

The problem is that some of our warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise they've been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely. Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens that kill eggs as soon as they're implanted.

The task of tracking this hunter falls to me, but I will admit that they have vexed me so far. I have an idea though. A few years ago, I had met a man with a crimson monocle that allowed them to see blood as if it were a shining beacon. They claimed they had it crafted from the eye of a death kiss. If I had such a tool, I would be able to hunt this hunter without a problem.

The problem is that some of our warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise they've been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely. Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens that kill eggs as soon as they're implanted.

I'll take just about anything and pay for it out of my own pocket if it will keep the people of the village in good health. Mummy bandages would be of a great help, the precious oils in them can be extracted and diluted quite a lot to make treatments for all sorts of ailments.

Find some manual ashes from golems and bring them back, I'll give you a decent price for them.
