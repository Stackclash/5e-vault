# Chapter 3: The Harvest Tables
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II, p. 6* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I am aware that in my previous volume, I stated that I was presenting the complete knowledge of harvesting all creatures in the multiverse. While it was true at the time, intrepid explorers other than myself have discovered even more creatures to hunt and harvest. While I am ashamed of misleading my readers, I am humbled by the idea that even I have more to discover and write about in this wonderful lifetime of mine.

## Understanding the Tables

Every unique monster from "Volo's Guide to Monsters" has been listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant monster in this guide, and read out the results (monsters are listed in the same order they are given in "Volo's Guide to Monsters"). The following is an explanation of how to read the table.

### DC

This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to successfully harvest that item.

### Item

The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Catoblepas Fur (large pouch) or Barghest Blood (5 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.

> [!embed-variantrule]- Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials
> ![[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Variant Rules/Optional Rule Harvesting Dangerous Materials Hhhvi.md\|Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials]]

### Description

A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a "**Use**" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.

Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material will be listed here.

### Value

All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependant on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as "varies" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.

When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, Barghest Blood is harvested as a set of 5 vials, and so the value listed (1 gp) refers to each individual vial (so successfully harvesting Barghest Blood would be worth 5 Ã— 1 gp = 5 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Maw Demon Teeth is harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: "large bag." Thus the 1 gp value listed refers to the value of a "large bag of Maw Demon Teeth", not 1 gp for each individual tooth.

> [!readaloud] Value Factors
> 
> The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although Devourer Skin may be worth the high price of 2,250 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.
^value-factors

### Weight

The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.

### Crafting

Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.

The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.

## Humanoid Trinket Tables

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> While it is still considered rather ghastly practice to harvest a humanoid, looting their corpses is considered marginally less so. This is good news, especially since I have found that the quality of dropped loot has increased as of late.

Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armor. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.

There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to largely be used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse. **New tables have been provided for humanoids that already appeared in the "Monster Manual". The DM is free to choose which table they wish to use.**

Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.

What I like to do is to leave one cranium rat alive so that it may go seek the rest of its kind, and then sweep in and bag them all at the same time. While this may end up starting a chain of events that leads to an illithid invasion, it's also a very time efficient method of stocking up on harvesting materials.

### Darklings

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Unfortunately, a slain darkling is not much use in harvesting as their bodies explode upon their death, releasing the light they have absorbed in one destructive and burning flash. I once had a theory that the light was kept in their torsos, and as such thought that a limb severed while the darkling was still alive would remain stable. Unfortunately, I was wrong, and all I had to show for it was a leg's worth of ash and an understandably irritated darkling.

### Demons

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> More and more demons just keep popping out the woodwork, and still none of them have the decency to leave a valid carcass unless I slay them on their home plane! I guess that's the reason they say that fiends are responsible for driving mortals insane.

Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Abyss.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll for it on the table below.

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: "You have a constant need to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly possible."

The relatively lowbrow name "froghemoth" originates from a bardic play called "Attack of the Froghemoth", which featured the titular creature as a 50-foot tall, village-crushing force of nature. The play was extremely popular with theatre goers despite its lack of artistic merit, and so the name stuck around and has been used ever since.

### Giants

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> It is often a point of contention among scholars on what is actually the taxological ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: taxonomical] difference that separates giants and humanoids. After all, in many ways the giants are just large humans (or dwarves or halflings or gnomes, for that matter). In my studies of them however, I have found that a giant's physiology is extremely malleable, allowing them to either alter themselves or be altered by environmental factors much more than the average humanoid. Perhaps this is an added feature of the Ordning, allowing individual giants greater ability to delineate themselves within their caste, or even break free from it altogether. Either way, it makes for an exciting harvesting adventure, since when you cut one open, you can never be exactly sure of what you'll find.

## Harvest Table: H

### Hags

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> The rules for hags is the same as that of disasters: they're dangerous, they're best to be avoided, and they tend to come in threes. Harvesting a hag is also a dangerous proposition as contact with their bodily fluids carries the risk of contracting the dreaded '[crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease).' Great care should always be exercised when carving up one of these ladies, otherwise you run the risk of looking like my childhood nanny for the rest of your life

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting "[Crone's Disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease)." Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease). A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease) as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.

Upon contracting [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease), 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] may return the creature to their normal appearance.

### Ki-Rin

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> So strong is the ki-rin's compassion for other living creatures, that it can influence their behaviour even after its death. Items crafted from a ki-rin shine with such magnificence that they can inspire even the lowliest of ne'er do-wells to altruism. I have seen this with my own hands when a notorious drinking buddy of mine turned his life around after a mere glance at a bundle of golden ki-rin fur. While I am happy that he has found peace in his life, I do miss having someone to sip whiskey with after a long day's journey.

A ki-rin is such a force of good that their body parts are capable of influencing the morality and alignment of those around them. Whenever you consume or finish a long rest attuned to an item made from a material harvested from a ki-rin, you have a 90% chance of having your alignment changed to lawful good for the next 24 hours. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell or similar magic will revert you to your original alignment early.

### Orcs

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Although they may seem like a godless bunch, orcs have a much deeper connection to their pantheon than most other humanoids. Allowing themselves to be irrevocably altered by their deities is a rite of passage amongst them, and while this does make them more dangerous, it also increases the value of their corpses.

### Redcap

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> As far as I'm aware, a redcap is the only creature that is born fully clothed. As such, it could be asked whether they count as clothes at all, or if they should be considered extensions of their body in the same vein as a creature's hair or nails. I prefer the latter definition as it makes it more justified to harvest them, rather than just "looting" them.

### Sea Spawn

## Harvest Table: T

### Tlincalli

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Despite some similarities in basic anatomy, tlincalli are in fact not related to centaurs. While centaurs are much closer in taxonomy to humanoids and fey, tlincalli share more with giant insects. As part of this, the magic to be harvested from a tlincalli comes more from its "natural" features like its claws and chitin, instead of magically powered organs or blood

### Trapper

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> There is some debate as to whether the trapper is related to the infamous dungeon-dwelling cloaker. While it is true that one is a monstrosity and the other an aberration, their similar abilities of illusion and obfuscation, plus the parallels in their internal physiology are not to be ignored. Of course, while it is entirely possible that these are simply the results of convergent evolution, I encourage the research into this line of thinking (especially since it raises the demand from researchers for cloaker and trapper carcasses).

They may even be coaxed into providing shelter when provided with appropriate gifts; something I discovered when I attempted to live among them as research for this book. Unfortunately, their culture was so alien to me that I gained nothing from the experience except for a hacking cough that followed me for several months.

## Harvest Table: Y

### Yeth Hound

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I remember when I first started learning the art of harvesting, old master Chien gave me an assignment to dissect a fresh yeth hound he had brought home. I recall him chuckling in the corner as I futilely attempted to cut into it with my scalpel, not realising that the hounds may only be pierced by silver or magical instruments. Apparently, this is a prank he enjoys pulling on all of his students, and he never fails to bring it up whenever I visit him for tea.

The yeth hound's immunity to non-magical, non-silvered weapons continues into death, and as such, they may only be harvested using silvered or magical tools.

### Yuan-Tis

Not only are they extremely militaristic and isolationist, they live in the most inhospitable, mosquito ridden, disease spreading jungles imaginable. At the very least, I got a good picture for the cover of this book out of it.
