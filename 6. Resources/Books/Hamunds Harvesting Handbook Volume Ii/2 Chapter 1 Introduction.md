# Chapter 1: Introduction
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II, p. 3* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Sir Hamund Holderhek, O.B.H. (First Class), V.A., N.K.P.

> Welcome back dear reader to another installation of Hamund's Harvesting Handbook. By now I'm sure you've all cut your teeth on the monsters and creatures featured in Volume I ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook I.json] of this series and have come back hungry for more. Well you are in luck, because I have spent the interim hunting and harvesting all of the monsters featured in that seminal work; "Volo's Guide to Monsters" (written by another man who appreciates the value of good branding) and have prepared yet another catalogue of the natural riches to be found in the creatures around us.
> 
> But wait, there's more! I have brought back secret spells from forgotten lands, filled a list of new items to craft, and even compiled a compendium of the needy people I met on my travels in the hopes that my readers may lend them a helping hand. The book you hold is more than just an instruction manual, it is a veritable travel guide to adventure!
> 
> So, indulge yourselves dear readers in the knowledge that I have gained and now pass onto you. Discover how to skin a sea spawn, gut a grung, and debone a devourer (which is quite a difficult feat considering they are almost nothing but bones). Learn how to craft powerful weapons from the spoils of your hunts, as well as wield new magic to aid you in your work. The sky is the limit in our profession, and even the old dogs among you could still stand to learn a few new tricks.
> 
> Good luck and good harvesting,

## Aim of this Guide

Thank you for purchasing the second instalment of the "Hamund's Harvesting Handbook" series. This volume covers the monsters included in "Volo's Guide to Monsters", and as before, features a complete harvesting list for each monster, as well as over 80 new magical items to craft. The rules for harvesting and crafting are unchanged, but this book does add a few more interesting pieces to add to your harvesting adventures. Premiering in this book are new NPC merchants for you to pull out on the fly, 6 new spells designed to help harvesters, as well as a job board for every monster in the "Monster Manual" and "Volo's" to help DMs make harvesting-based quests on the fly. Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course feel free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at *driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com* or hit me up on Twitter @drifterworkshop (https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop) to discuss anything in this guide.
