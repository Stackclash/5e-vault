# Chapter 1: Introduction
*Source: Hamund's Herbalism Handbook, p. 2* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Sir Hamund Holderhek, O.B.H. (First Class), V.A., N.K.P.  
> 
> Welcome dear reader to a brand new series of learning and adventure, brought to you by none other than I, Sir Hamund Holderhek! On the off chance that my published works have yet to reach you, let me say that I am a writer by trade, but an explorer at heart. Through my many years of wandering these planes of existence, I have seen, done, and conquered just about everything the multiverse has to offer!
> 
> I have scaled peaks that pierce the heavens, trekked across sands scorched by sun, and plunged into depths that border the Hells themselves, and through all of it I have marvelled at what nature has to show to me each time. For this volume in particular however, I have chosen to focus on nature's more understated, yet crucial gifts: plants and herbs.
> 
> Within this book is the compilation of copious amounts of travel notes, interacting with and consuming every magical plant ranging from the mighty mountain heart ginseng, to the mirthful sillypad. Within these pages you will find not only an exhaustive compendium of useful plants and herbs you may find on your travels, but also instructions on how to forage for them, how to brew them into powerful tinctures, new spells to add to your arsenals, and also my many humorous thoughts and musings. Nature has grown these miracles for us, and after reading this book, you will know how to take them all for yourself!
> 
> Good luck and good harvesting,
