> Herbalism is not simply wandering around and picking pretty flowers! Herbalism is a holistic trade with many facets that people can spend lifetimes to master. I present some of these extra facets to you, so you too may devote yourself to them and perhaps one day rival even my own knowledge (I highly doubt it).

## Hamund's Helpers

> If you've reached this far in my book, no doubt you've become quite the herbalism master! But do not think you are the only one who has studied this art; in my travels I have met many that have studied the plants and flora of these worlds, and found those whose talents astound even I! You may even find these restless souls during your own travels. If you do, make sure to mention my name—they may give you a discount on some of their services.

The following are some NPCs that a DM can easily slot into any campaign or setting. Feel free to use theseNPCs as convenient ways for the party to provide herbalism related services whenever they are needed.

### Herbal Vendor

**Name.** Harry Holderhek  
**Race.** Halfling-Dwarf  
**Hamund's Notes.** The Holderhek clan is large and expansive—even growing to include many couplings between dwarves and other races. Harry is one such product of these unions, half a halfling, and half a dwarf (specifically, my second cousin Harchibold Holderhek). Having grown in the forests of his mother's people, Harry has long been familiar with plant life, taking to the druidic arts and becoming one of the foremost experts on herbs. In fact, his knowledge on the subject was instrumental in the writing of this book.  

    Harry spends most of his time these days wandering the planes, looking for more rare plants to catalogue and research. He funds his travels by selling some of the more powerful herbs he finds along the way. In fact, his spice pouch of holding seems to have a never-ending supply of useful plants for any occasion, and his upstanding Holderhek morals means he always parts with them for a reasonable price.

### Tincture Brewer

**Name.** Mona  
**Race.** Human (?)  
**Hamund's Notes.** Mona is an odd individual to be sure, but I do ask you give them a fair chance when you meet them, as they are the finest brewer of tinctures I have met in my travels. Through a technique that they refuse to share with me, they are capable of brewing a herb into a tincture in a single day, allowing them to work through vast amounts of herbs at an unheard of speed. You do need to supply all related materials and costs for a regular tincture, plus a premium charge of an extra 20% on top of that, but I would say the fee is well worth the time and convenience they can save you.  

    Also, despite their pallid skin, stiff movements, and raspy voice, they will assure you that they are most definitely alive and NOT a sentient zombie. I highly advise you not to contest them on this point, lest you risk finding their spit mixed in with your tincture order.
