# Chapter 3: The Herb Compendium
*Source: Hamund's Herbalism Handbook, p. 5* 

This section contains the list of more than 160 herbs created for this book, as well as an explanation of how to read a herb's entry.

## Name

The name of the herb, listed in alphabetical order.

## Requires Preparation

This section denotes whether or not a herb needs preparation before it can be used ("described in more detail in Chapter 2").

## Description

A description of the herb written by Hamund. While these are usually just flavour, they also often inform the player how the herb is applied which may impact very specific game scenarios.

## Location

Specific herbs grow in specific environments, having grown to adapt to their surroundings. This section lists which environment the herb can be found in, which is also the herb environment table for where they can be rolled.

> [!note] Inhospitable Environments
> 
> Although the herbs listed in this guide are meant to be findable in most locations, the DM has full discretion to determine if an environment is completely devoid of plant life and thus unsuitable for finding any herbs. Locations like this may include the peaks of mountains, in the middle of the ocean, the depths of the Nine Hells, etc.
> 
> In other cases, the DM may decide that plants can grow in an environment, but due to various circumstances, their availability may be limited—such as during a severe drought, or while travelling through the mostly barren lands of the Shadowfell. In these cases, the DC for gathering all herbs is increased by 5. Similarly, if the players are in an environment in which plant life is extremely abundant—such as the forests of the Feywild—then the DC for gathering all herbs are lowered by 5.

## Effect

The effect that the herb imparts once used. Some are destructive, single-use items, while others have beneficial effects that can be used repeatedly. If a herb lists a number of charges based on a dice roll, these charges are rolled for when the herb is first gathered.
