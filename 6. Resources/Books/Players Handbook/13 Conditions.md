# Conditions
*Source: Player's Handbook, p. 289* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]], are impairments, but a few, such as [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible\|invisible]], can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]] condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#deafened\|deafened]]  - [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]]  - [[/5.
