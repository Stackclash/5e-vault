# Strongholds
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

It's cool to have a place of your own. A headquarters, a base. A castle, a tower, a keep.

It would be even better if your headquarters *did* something cool for you. Gave you some useful ability, preferably in combat, since that's where a lot (not all!) of the game happens. It's certainly where the life and death stuff happens.

It's also nice to have a reason to hoard money. Delving deep into dark dungeons promises three rewards: experience, magic items, and *money*.

Experience is a self-evident good, as it makes your character level up and gain power.

Magic items, likewise. They let you do cool things your character would never normally be able to do.

Money, though? What are we supposed to do with it? At least one edition granted players easy access to creating magic items, a fine way to spend your money. A side effect of this is the assumed presence of shops in sufficiently large cities where you can buy magic items.

But the modern edition makes the opposite assumption. Players during the 5E playtest said they wanted magic to be rare, and the dev team listened. Magic is rare and "magic shoppes" are not assumed in the base game.

Strongholds and their upgrades, therefore, give you a good reason to save your money.

## Types of Stronghold

There are four types of basic stronghold, one complex stronghold, and many varieties. Any character can build or use any stronghold, although why a non-spellcasting character might build a tower is an exercise left to the reader. Maybe they have a spellcasting NPC ally!

A "keep" is a martial stronghold for characters interested in raising armies and defending the local townsfolk. Barbarian camps and pirate ships are variations on this.

A "tower" is an arcane stronghold for doing spell research and learning battle magic.

A "temple" is a divine stronghold for summoning extraplanar allies and learning battle magic. A druid's grove is a popular variation.

An "establishment" is an espionage stronghold for sabotaging your enemies and generating revenue.

A "castle" combines two or more of the above into a larger complex owned and run by multiple characters, each of whom can gain the mechanical benefits thereof.

Ultimately, the idea that there are four kinds of strongholds (and some variations of each) is completely arbitrary. You could easily have six kinds, or one for each class. Or no "types," just different abilities to buy a la carte. But I find these four get us 90% of what we need, with their variations getting us another 9%. And for those players who want a stronghold not listed here, hopefully the variations are sufficient to help the GM come up with a unique variant without much work.

## Acquiring a Stronghold

There are three basic ways for the party to acquire a stronghold: they are (in order of most expensive to least expensive) build a new one, renovate an old one, or receive one from a local noble.

### Building a Stronghold, Cost and Time

The cost (in gold) and time to build (in days) for each of the four strongholds are listed below. These are not based on any historical numbers mostly because humans were building castles for about 600 years until the invention of gunpowder made them obsolete and there's no reasonable way to translate those costs into a fantasy game. But even were we to pick a historical period as our baseline, there was no time in history that had bands of wizards and warlocks roaming the countryside pillaging dragon hordes and coming back to civilization with tens of thousands of gold pieces.

Therefore any costs we derive must first be based in the economies of a fantasy RPG. And that means they must cost a lot, but not take too long. If it takes 10 years to build your stronghold, no PC would ever do it. Keeps and towers, temples and establishments each have wildly different purposes with different costs and different times to build.

"Keeps" are larger and more fortified for defensive purposes and therefore take longer to build: 150 days.

"Temples" and "towers" are less fortified but still usually made of stone and take 120 days to complete at 1st level.

An **establishment** serves no defensive purpose, typically existing within a town or city with its own fortifications. But your establishment is still well-constructed with basements, multiple floors, and probably secret passages for you and your allies to escape out of...or in to! They take 90 days to complete.

### Strongholds as Fortifications

Keeps, towers, and temples also count as Fortifications in Warfare (see page 231 for the rules on Warfare). These fortifications grant Morale bonuses to the soldiers defending them in battle. They also have a Size representing the die used to track damage done to them, and a Toughness rating representing how hard they are to damage. Because they don't attack, they have no Attack, Defense, or Power ratings.

### Upgrading Your Stronghold

Once built, your stronghold can be upgraded by taking more time and spending more money, as shown on the charts on the previous page. You can spend more money to build a larger stronghold from the start, but there is no time or cost savings.

### Castles: Complex Strongholds

A stronghold belongs to whoever pays for it, and they are its master. If Cail the Wizard builds a tower, he gets to decide who gains its benefits. He may allow his sorcerer or warlock pals to do spell research there... until one or both betrays him! Or he, them! Only one character can gain the benefit of a given stronghold at a time, and each character can only benefit from one stronghold ability at a time.

If multiple characters chip in to pay for a stronghold—or one character just spends a lot of money—it is a castle and provides multiple benefits. Complex tasks take proportionally more time and money than simple ones, so a castle costs 10% more and takes 10% longer for every basic stronghold function it incorporates.

> Jess, Anna, and Lars decide to pitch in together and buy a castle. It will contain a keep, a temple, and a tower. It will cost 33,800 gp and take 507 days. That's 10,000 gp for the keep and 8,000 gp each for the tower and temple, 150 days for the keep and 120 days each for the temple and tower. Then an extra 30% on top (multiply time and cost each by 1.3) to account for the extra work necessary to incorporate many functions in one structure.

A castle cannot contain multiple of the same type of stronghold. If you build a castle with two towers, for instance, only one of them grants the benefits of spell research. Also, a stronghold's benefit only applies to one character at a time. A character can switch between which stronghold benefits they receive by taking an "extended rest" (page 15).

The purpose of the design is, on the one hand, to somewhat model the real world where building a movie theater and automotive plant in the same building would (one assumes) take longer than the time to build each separately. For one thing the different kinds of strongholds have different requirements and therefore it takes more and different kinds of workers to complete them and the more workers you have the harder it is to coordinate them all.

But also, one goal of these rules is to give players things to do in their **downtime**, and this is a period for individual goals and initiative. Usually when one of my players builds a stronghold, everyone hangs out there.

All the Avengers hang out at Avenger's Mansion but at the end of the day, Tony Stark built that place and it and Jarvis answer to him and when things go wrong he's on the hook for it.

Finally, don't presume that just because you as a player think it would be a good idea for "all of us" to build a stronghold together, that everyone else at the table agrees. In my experience, one or two players may agree, one or two players won't care, but one or two players actually have their own ideas about what should be done with what they perceive as "their share of the treasure." Make sure you've polled the electorate and listen to what they say. Folks who disagree often keep their mouths shut just to avoid conflict, and this is a great recipe for breeding unhappy players.

> [!note] Paying More to Get It Done Faster
> 
> Since building or repairing any stronghold requires a labor force, it's reasonable for players to conclude that hiring more artisans and laborers will speed up the process!
> 
> To a small degree this is true, but the rules assume your workers are working optimally, so adding more laborers will, paradoxically, cause it to take longer. This is a fact as well-documented as it is oft-ignored. The famous (real-world) book **The Mythical Man-Month** details exactly what happens: Beyond a certain point, the larger your network, the more management it requires, the more communication it takes for everyone involved, and the harder it becomes for any single worker to find the answer to their question, get a task approved, or get unblocked (or even know who's blocking them) on a process.
> 
> Therefore, we assume the times represent a group of workers getting the job done in a reasonably fast manner and that adding more people to the team would just complicate things.

### Narrative Reasons for Different Costs and Timess

Of course, what seems reasonable to me may seem wildly unreasonable to you! Each GM's campaign is different, and different in ways that cannot be predicted or detected by any given designer.

Therefore, feel absolutely free to charge your players more or less, or speed up or slow down the time it takes to fit both your idea of what's reasonable, and the precedents you've established for your game. To make these decisions seem less like GM fiat and ground them in the rules and your game, consider the following.

Strongholds take more or less time to construct based on the availability of local workers. Maybe recent events in your campaign have made laborers and artisans scarce or plentiful! Whatever local problem the players have recently dealt with, it may have scared many valuable workers away from the area (strongholds take more time). Or, with that problem solved, maybe more workers are available and willing to help our stalwart heroes (strongholds take less time)!

Strongholds may cost more if the local area turns out to be resource poor. It takes wood and stone to make a stronghold, and not just any wood or stone.

"Can't build from this," Arranel the Woodwright says, shaking her head. "Trees are all beech round here. Can't make a proper truss or scaffold with beech. No block or tackle neither. Rope'll chew right through it."

"And the stone here's all got lime running through it. Water table's just a few feet down, I reckon," Galder of Chalk, the stonemason observes. "Gonna have to send to Rest to get some proper granite. Cost a pretty penny, that."

So the costs may be more exorbitant than the rules imply. The reverse is also true!

"No gold, sorry to break it to you. Know you ratcatchers love comin' up gold. But plenty of iron," Zoran Steeleye, foreman of the mine, says. "More'n enough to get you started on a proper keep."

Circumstances both natural and political may conspire to make your campaign's costs different from these. Indeed, in some campaign worlds metal is as rare as...a very rare thing! And we might imagine a stronghold would be a very expensive proposition on that dead world under a black star.

### When Is It Done?

Keep in mind that a 1st-level keep is a simple motte-and-bailey and would still appear to be "under construction" when it is actually done. It can act as a defensive stronghold well before it's pretty and all the finishing touches are complete. It may be hard to imagine Camelot being built in a little more than a year, but that's because the structure we imagine with pink walls and pennants flying is what you get long after the place was a functioning castle.

### At What Level Should Characters Get a Stronghold?

There's no correct answer to this, it is entirely up to the GM. I've run games in which the PCs started at 1st level playing local nobles complete with strongholds and domains. I've run for groups who at 3rd level cleared out an overrun watchtower and claimed it as their base.

As the GM, you can simply decide it would be fun if the players started with or cleared out their own stronghold at low levels. One of the great moments in any campaign, for me, is just after the players de-orc a ruined keep and realize, "Hey! We could make this place our base!" This is the moment when the players start using the things they find in the world as their own resources. The world feels real to them. They are thinking about things besides killing monsters.

Maybe the question is "At what level can the PCs afford to build their own stronghold?" That's easy to figure out. We start by imagining the players want to pool their money together to build a castle for 50,000 gold pieces.

So we scrubbed through the published adventures to figure out: when would the characters be able to afford a keep? Well if they go through the official 5E Big Giant Adventure...the answer is surprising. By 6th level in the Big Giant Adventure, the players can have accumulated enough gold to buy a keep. Assuming they find all the gold and roll average on random results.

In practice, however, it difficult to find all the gold in an adventure, especially adventures with sandbox elements, or branches. Different groups often come out with wildly different amounts of cash from the same adventure. 7th level, therefore, is a reasonable conclusion.

### Do Not Assume the Adventure Will Suffice

Different editions treat gold differently. Some classic 1st Edition adventures award many tens of thousands of gold at low levels (often in copper pieces, on purpose, to make the act of getting the gold back to civilization a challenge in itself). Some adventures have hardly any gold in them at all. Not only does this vary from edition to edition, it varies wildly from one adventure to another within an edition.

Therefore, Game Masters who think "my players will want a stronghold" should make sure they dump enough gold on the players to make it possible. The gold you award becomes a knob you turn to adjust when exactly the players can afford a stronghold of their own. Assuming they need to buy the thing at all! There are other options!

## Repairing a Ruin

As any druid worth their salt—or any other minerals—will tell you: nature is pretty aggressive. Without proper upkeep, roots and vines and weather will take their toll and in only a year a stronghold can require so much upkeep to get back in shape that it qualifies as a ruin. Practically, if the keep or tower or temple in your adventure has some crumbling walls and perhaps a few rooms or entire floor exposed to the elements, it is certainly a ruin.

**Repairing a ruin saves you half the time and cost of the final stronghold**. So repairing a ruined level 1 keep would only cost 5,000 gold and take 75 days.

It's up to the GM to decide whether the ruin is a single-player stronghold or a castle that can serve as a complex that contains some combination of basic strongholds within.

How badly ruined a stronghold is, is purely a judgement call by the GM, but here are some guidelines. If it has multiple levels with any intact rooms, **each level** saves another 500 gold in cost and 7 days off the total time. If it has any **wholly intact** levels, each level instead saves you 1,000 gp and 14 days.

If there are several (more than three, including a dungeon level) levels with intact rooms, then this is probably not a 1st-level stronghold. It could be a 2nd-level or 3rd-level stronghold! GMs, remember in your generosity that strongholds cap out at 5th level. Letting players repair a ruin so that they end up with a level 4 or 5 stronghold gives them immense power and little left to strive for.

## Awarding a Stronghold

Any local stronghold in good enough shape not to need repair actually belongs to someone. Legally. Some local noble. It might be currently overrun by orcs, or even sitting surrounded by forest overgrowth, forgotten. But as soon as the party clears it out, it becomes unforgotten and the local duke or queen says, "Hey that's mine."

Nobles get really persnickety when a bunch of ratcatchers decide some stronghold in the noble's territory is "theirs." The local nobles start to feel like maybe these itinerant campaigners are trying to muscle in on their cushy gig.

At the same time, nobles are not stupid—though they may well be prideful, fearful, or full of hubris—so they might realize **any mercenary group powerful enough to clear out the orcs would serve better as subjects or allies than enemies**.

So *typically* the local noble will be very thankful and generous. A duke might nominate the most noble and trustworthy party member (favoring lawful good, or lawful, or the same alignment as the noble) and invest them as baron. Congratulations! You're a landed noble!

As democratic and egalitarian as the players may feel, unless your world is *wildly* different from a medieval society, the local noble won't be keen on the idea of an autonomous collective running a stronghold. The *players* may feel like they collectively saved the noble's forgotten stronghold for them, but the noble does not recognize "an adventuring party" as a legitimate form of government.

So while *many* PCs can enjoy the benefits of a castle (i.e. a complex stronghold, one that belongs to many characters) as far as local politics are concerned, *one* PC is responsible for it. When the local noble has a problem, it's that PC who's on the hook.

Furthermore, the local noble can simply award the players a stronghold as payment for some service. "Thank you for stopping that local death cult, here's the right and title to a small keep." Now, this may be exactly as it seems and the players just get a stronghold, no strings attached. Not very *dramatic* though, is it?

In a situation like that, we expect there's some reason the stronghold is available to be awarded. Maybe it's a ruin, and there may be some costs associated with getting it up and running. Or it's full of goblins. Or...oozes! Yeah that sounds dramatic. A cult of Orcus! Good luck!

Ultimately the rule is there is *always* some "cost." Either in gold or risk. Even a 100% no-strings-attached, no-orc-infestation stronghold will have required the players to do something incredibly risky beforehand, adventure-wise, to earn the local noble's favor.

## Political Complications

Something I've enjoyed doing in my own campaign is putting a document granting right and title to a stronghold to whosoever holds the deed. This is, certainly, ahistorical...but it is dramatic!

This throws an interesting monkey wrench into the political landscape, since the dead king wrote this document and therefore technically all the local nobility must abide by it. But...is it really a good idea to have some murderhobos running the show over there?

That kind of "well yes this document says the keep is yours but I, and my army *really* want it" conflict makes great drama! With lots of local powers lining up to see who they should ally with, who's going to be on the winning side of any future conflict.

Generally, you'll want to assume that the PCs' actions have **unintended consequences**. When you build or buy or clear out a tower and make it yours, you make allies and enemies. You are upsetting the Steady State World, and have created an Inciting Incident, for which see Running the Game #24 ^[ If you don't know what Running the Game is, have I got a YouTube channel for you! I mean...I do. I literally have a YouTube channel for you.].

There is typically no cost here—the stronghold is a gift. The cost can be thought of as the risk to life and limb the players undertook. Though the local noble may gift the PCs a stronghold that needs some repair, that's pretty classic. The players imagine Greywall Keep as a Camelot-esque castle with pink walls and strict laws governing precipitation, but when they arrive they will discover the local noble was perhaps not as forthcoming with details as might be desired. Classic.

## Certifying Ownership

This is purely a tradition in my campaign, but as soon as the players begin getting a stronghold, I tell them outright: they can spend the money, and it will get built, but they don't gain the benefit of it until they defend it in battle, as described more in "Appendix Two: Warfare" (page 231). This is, usually, the first time the players have encountered the Warfare system, but so far over approximately six campaigns, the players have never balked at this condition, and so far they have always looked forward to the battle! Of course, your mileage may vary.

The idea here is that raising the metaphorical flag and saying "this place is mine" sends a signal to local actors who heretofore took no notice of some low-level ratcatchers. But once you'd built a tower, keep, or temple, suddenly you're important enough to fear!

Establishments attract less attention, certainly, but even building a new inn or tavern sends a signal, in which case it is the town itself, not the establishment that comes under attack. Better start building some walls!

## Extended Rest

Strongholds grant special abilities, which quickly run out of uses and must be recharged by taking an **extended rest**. An extended rest requires spending a week at your stronghold, touching base with your subjects and followers, and attending to your affairs.

This rule exists for a couple of reasons. First, it reinforces verisimilitude. It's unreasonable to expect a stronghold to grant its benefits indefinitely. A fighter who hasn't visited their keep in years is indistinguishable from a fighter without a stronghold!

Second, they give players a good reason to return home and that grants you, the GM, the opportunity to advance the politics of your campaign. It's possible, *via sending* or a *diplomats* pouch or just mundane messengers on horseback, to advance your politics without visiting your stronghold and, indeed, some of this should be allowed, but major events and revelationsare better handled in person and, should war break out, a lord cannot command their troops from the bottom of a dungeon.

## Power!

**Strongholds unbalance the game** ^[I think 5E is the best-designed edition of the game, but I also think some players overfocus on "balance" because they feel the game is something to be "solved." They expect a level of rigor more appropriate to a wargame or a card game. I don't have those  expectations for an RPG.]. A paladin with a fully upgraded stronghold has access to many more abilities than a paladin without one. This is by design. It's fine to let your players get ahead of the power curve; you, the GM, have all the tools you need to challenge them. You have access to all the monsters, and you can make them nastier than usual.

To help rebalance things, we give villains and their minions their own stronghold abilities that are less complex—and therefore easier for an already overburdened GM to use—than the stronghold abilities of the PCs. See "Villain Strongholds" on page 66.

## Strongholds & Politics

Strongholds also represent a political framework. Many campaigns tick along nicely without anyone, including the GM, worrying about things like "who's in charge here?" Where "here" is "this area of the map" or "this town" or "the area around the dungeon." This is perfectly fine; many successful campaigns have run for years without anyone needing to worry about this. These rules change those assumptions. Because a Stronghold is also a symbol of power, it threatens other local lords. Even if your players have no martial ambitions, if they attract a few units of light cavalry suddenly they will start wondering "hey what can I do with these?"

So your world, if you use this book, slowly transforms into one where there are local powers. These "powers" are usually nobility, but they can be any characters with power and an army. A wizard with a tower may only have a small hamlet outside, and that hamlet has its own town council and the wizard doesn't bother them. But if the local Baron needs arcane assistance, it's this wizard he turns to. These nobles and powerful NPCs rule different areas, they have their own strongholds and armies and their own subjects who work for them and will fight with them.

### Local Powers

It's easy to go overboard when worldbuilding and assume you need to have every detail mapped out. Dozens of major and minor players, all the different barons and archmages and bishops and guildmasters can seem an insurmountable task.

So don't do that! You only really need three other local powers; an ally, an enemy, and someone who is neither. We can add more as we play, but we only need the three to get started.

**The enemy** lord serves an obvious purpose. They are a powerful threat by which the players can test themselves. They are opposed to the players' growing power for whatever reason.

**The ally**, probably not as powerful as the player, but older and more experienced, helps the player understand the nature of the political world they have found themselves in. And, should push come to shove, the allied lord can throw in with the player and contribute their meager army to the cause.

**The neutral lord** is someone with power, the power to determine who will win in the coming conflict between the player and the enemy lord, but currently on no one's side. Known not to be an ally of the evil lord, but also not on the players' side. It's going to take some negotiation, roleplaying, maybe some favors to sway them.

This small framework of three NPCs gives you everything you need to start a moderately robust political game. These characters do not appear by magic, they are NPCs that need to be introduced and developed like any other.
