# Introduction
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

Once upon a time in the dim days of the hobby known as the 1970s, the game assumed you played until you were about 7th level and then built a stronghold. There were no rules for this, nor was any reason given for why the player or their character might want to do such a thing.

For those original players, building a stronghold was a *self-evident good*. It was just neat, and they assumed it would be obvious why you would want to do such a thing. It meant your character was now interested in things besides killing orcs and acquiring gold. Treasure was a means to an end. As your character grew in power, they became more concerned with the state of the world. There were political conflicts and armies and incursions from other dimensions, and a single fighter with a sword, even a very nice sword with its own personality and special purpose, was not enough. You needed an army, or new spells, or extraplanar allies.

The game transitioned from local problems to national problems, to global problems. Eventually, your 7th-level character fought a few wars or invented a spell or two, and then retired. Typically around 13th level. And that was it. The game had an end.

This book seeks to recreate that style of play, but in a modern sense, by giving the players reasons to build strongholds. And we got a lotta reasons. ðŸ˜ƒ

In this book you will find rules for four types of strongholds: "keeps" help you raise armies and improve your fighting ability, "temples" help you summon extraplanar allies to aid you in battle, "towers" let you research new spells, and "establishments" let you collect secrets and generate cash.

Every stronghold also improves your signature class feature, powering up your Bardic Inspiration or your monk's Ki. Strongholds grant **improved class features** because they draw power from the land itself.

The local area around your stronghold is called your **demesne** (deh-MAIN). Within your demesne, your character is now, if not ruler, certainly a very important person, so the power of the land manifests itself in unusual ways in your favor.

Building a stronghold also inspires people, allowing you to **attract followers** by rolling on a chart specific to your class. These followers could be mercenary legions or artisan peasants, foreign ambassadors or fellow adventuring heroes!

Large-scale actions taken by your new army, your stronghold, or your followers sometimes take **months or seasons**. Also, your new abilities eventually run out of juice, after which you must return to your demesne to refresh yourself. This is called an **extended rest**.

To support these new options, the book comes with many new systems, including rules for "warfare", in which units of soldiers clash; rules for **concordance**, which allows any character to plead with their deity for aid; rules for **creating new magic items**; and rules for taking your "**retainers**" with you into combat without having to run an entire second character.

## GM-Approved?

Talk to your GM to make sure these new rules are allowed in their game. This book asks a lot of your GM, they are expected to:

- Run NPC followers, including complex and powerful special allies.  
- Figure out which neighbors are happy or upset with your growing power in the local area.  
- Make combat harder, to compensate for your new combat abilities.  

That's a lot of work and your GM may have different plans for their game. They might be okay with some of these rules, but not others!

## Alignment

This book references alignment a lotâ€”don't freak out. It's merely deployed as an organizational tool. A fun way of saying "allied" or "opposed." And a way to categorize allies and monsters dramatically. Paladins oppose chaos and evil, clerics embody good; these are just cool ways of referring to the forces opposing or allied with the heroes.

Feel free to recontextualize these references however you like. If you're playing a...lawful neutral paladin, perhaps opposing chaos is more important or useful to you than good or evil. Or maybe alignment isn't useful at all, in which case the player and the GM can agree to use "allied" or "opposed." Alignment was originally invented as an excuse to yell at players who were backstabbing other players by inventing "teams" and requiring them to pick "our team" if they were going to continue playing, so best not to take it too seriously.
