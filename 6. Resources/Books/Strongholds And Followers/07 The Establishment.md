# The Establishment
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

Not all strongholds are mighty fortresses made of stone. If you're a rogue or bard, you have little use for an army, or your own bespoke spell, or...well actually, being able to summon allies in combat would be pretty nice, but then you'd have to pledge service to a deity, and you're not really the "follow through with your agreements" type. You prefer people owing you favors, not the other way round.

A business is much better! Businesses can be small and lucrative and, best of all, give no indication of what really goes on there. A legitimate business that hides your covert operation is called a "front," by the way. But here, we'll call it an **establishment**.

An establishment does two things: it makes money and gathers information, often from the same people it's making money off. Your establishment could be an inn or a general store, both classic examples. Or it could be a blacksmith's shop! Why not? So you don't know anything about blacksmithing, so what? You can hire a blacksmith who will be very happy to have someplace warm and dry and well equipped to do their business in!

Meanwhile, you make it a point to listen to all the interesting things the customers unwittingly reveal to the smith. Or you could stay away from the shop completely, have the blacksmith come to you with your part of the profits and whatever juicy tidbits folks were foolish enough to reveal. The better your front, the more likely folks are to speak openly there.

## Revenue

Each season (or every four months, depending on the calendar of your campaign world), your establishment generates 1,000 gp per establishment level. If your establishment is part of a castle, you can use this money to upgrade your castle, no problem.

## Rumors

During an adventure or in the lead-up to one, you can spend some money and collect some rumors about the quest you're about to go on. The cost is 100 gp per establishment level.

On a successful Gather Intel check (see below), you learn the name of one kind of creature you'll be fighting (goblins, bandits, dragons, oozes, etc.) and roughly how many there will be (a few, a dozen, dozens, a score, scores, etc.). During the adventure, those creatures will be vulnerable to damage from your attacks, for a number of attacks equal to your establishment level. In addition, the GM can choose to reveal any of the following:

- The location of a secret door or a hidden entrance or exit  
- The location and nature of a trap  
- A description of one riddle or puzzle  
- The location and description of one powerful magic item  

It may seem like this is taking the fun out of the adventure, but for the player with the establishment it will seem like the opposite. It will make them feel awesome, and at the end of the day, you can always add more traps and secret doors!,

> Yeah! That's sort of the point. But look at it this way: is it substantively more than your character gets from adventuring? Not in my experience. And apart from other things in this book, what exactly is there to spend money on? It's not like gold all by itself makes your character more effective in combat or harder to hit, nor does it solve problems in the dungeon or elsewhere. For many players, simply having a lot of money is a fun fantasy all by itself.

## Gathering Intel

Investigation allows you to do detective work, learning the whereabouts and activities of individuals, but organizations are larger and more complex. By collecting a little information from everyone who visits, your establishment lets you spy on organizations and people. This is represented by your Gather Intel skill, gained if you own an establishment.

Intel lets you know what your enemies are up to, along with your allies and those organizations—guilds, orders, countries, and such—who claim to be neutral. What you learn is up to the GM. It will be useful but highly generalized. For example, "The Monks of White Fire know you recovered the sword of a million years and they're planning on taking it from you," or "The king is closing trade across the southern border." Okay, that's good to know, but it's narrative. There's no mechanic tied to these things.

### Organizations

An organization is any collection of people who agree to common rules and hierarchy in order to further some agenda, goal, or philosophy. An order of knights, a wizards' college, a thieves' guild, a duchy, a barony, a church—though not a single church building, but the network of priests and acolytes who all believe in the same doctrine.

You don't have to know an organization exists to gather intel on it! In fact, that is a classic use of the Gather Intel skill! "I think there's a conspiracy to infiltrate the Knights of the White Hart, but I don't know by whom. Can I make a roll?"

The GM knows the nature of this villainous organization and can set the DC accordingly and let the player roll. If they succeed, they learn the name of the organization and possibly something about its makeup and goals.

### Range

Obviously you can't use your establishment to deduce the existence of organizations on the other side of the world. Your establishment is only effective against organizations operating within 24 miles times its establishment level. On many maps, a hex is 24 miles from side to side.

So, a 1st-level establishment could spy on organizations in its hex and in the six hexes around it (a one-hex radius). A 2nd-level establishment could spy on its hex and the 18 closest hexes (a two-hex radius).

### Making the Check

Gather Intel is a skill granted by your establishment, and it uses your stronghold level as its maximum bonus instead of an ability modifier ^[Because you're not actually there gathering the intel—the establishment and its employees do it while you're adventuring.]. So, a 1st-level establishment would let you make Gather Intel checks at a maximum bonus of +1. You are automatically proficient in Gather Intel if you have an establishment and add your proficiency modifier.

Gathering intel costs money—it's expensive to pay folks to spy on people! It costs 100 gp per level of your establishment. Larger establishments with larger bonuses have more people to pay! For each increment of 100 gp you pay, you gain a +1 bonus to the check. No, you can't pay nothing to roll at +0.

> Jennifer has a 3rd-level establishment (a general store). If she pays 300 gp, she can make a Gather Intel check at +3. She cannot pay 400 gp to get +4, because she is limited by the level of her establishment. But she could choose to pay 200 gp to get +2 to her roll.

You may make a number of Gather Intel checks per season equal to your establishment level, but you cannot make more than one check against the same organization during the same season.

### Setting the DC

Some organizations are easier to spy on than others! Players, when you specify the organization you're spying on, the GM sets the DC based on the criteria in this section, and you only get results for the organization you named, not the smaller organizations it controls.

Exactly how these factors determine the DC of the Gather Intel check is up to the GM, just as there are no hard and fast rules for what counts as "difficult" lore for character making an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]] check.

**How Big Is the Organization?** Bigger organizations are easier to spy on than smaller ones, because large organizations have more members and therefore more opportunities to eavesdrop on, blackmail, or infiltrate them.

Some organizations contain organizations of their own. A church may sponsor a secret order of knights. Spying on the church is easy—it's a big organization that operates out in the open. But that Gather Intel check won't tell you what the covert knights are up to. If you want to know that, you'll have to tell your GM before you roll, and they'll set the DC higher as a result.

**Is the Organization Covert?** Covert organizations are harder to spy on. They work to hide their operations as a matter of course. Duchies and churches are, as a rule, public institutions, and normal people can expect to at least be able to find and petition their agents, even if such an organization is tyrannical and unlikely to heed any such petition. They're pretty easy to spy on. In contrast, even large, known covert organizations such as Nine Silver, the guild of spies and assassins in Capital, are still covert. People know they exist! But they have no idea how to contact them or even who belongs to them.

**How Protective Is the Organization?** Does the organization know they're being spied on? Do they have counterintelligence agents who actively oppose the player's spies? A thieves' guild is much, much harder to spy on than a merchants' guild, and powerful rulers can deploy highly trained agents to prevent enemies from spying on them.

### Results

Remember that the benefits of a stronghold are a reward for spending money and time. So the results of a successful Gather Intel check should be useful, "actionable," meaning they should give information that helps the players make a plan, or develop a strategy, or advance the plot.

Avoid confirming suspicions. In other words, if a player says, "I think the Order of Five Stars is secretly in league with the baron," and they roll well, do not merely say, "Yes that's true." That is deeply unsatisfying, since the player already suspected that.

Instead, give them something to act on. "Yes, it seems like they are in league. Your people overheard a conversation that only makes sense if the wizard Luris is selling information to the baron."

Hey now, that is actionable. Maybe you just made up that wizard, that's fine! That's your job! But now the player has something to do.

### Limits

Your players will make a Gather Intel check, and you'll give them some juicy bit of knowledge, but of course you're not going to tell them everything. Which means they're going to ask for more. They'll want to drill down on what you said and pursue it. "Where did I get this info? Who told it to me?"

This just makes your life as GM more complicated because we GMs, of course, have no idea exactly who their spies heard this from, and if we're suddenly faced with the responsibility of not only inventing an NPC who we didn't know about five seconds ago, but also figuring out the entire signal path of how this NPC knows what they know and who they got it from, then we're going to want to ditch this whole system because it just makes more problems than solutions.

So when your players inevitably ask, "How exactly do I know this?" there's one easy answer: "Someone who works for you, someone you trust, overheard it, but they don't remember who said it."

You can even play it out. When the player, out of character, asks, "How do I know this?" You can respond in character. "*Don't know, ma'am. I was workin' the shop and overheard it. Ooh it musta been a week or more ago?*"

The player may not be satisfied by that and may even try to subvert the system by giving orders to their employees to, like, write everything down or keep a journal. At this point, it is perfectly appropriate to tell them, "This is the limit of what your stronghold can do." No point in misleading them—just give it to them straight. They are looking for a degree of specificity this system does not support.

The best character to deliver the results of the Gather Intel check to the PC is the PC's lieutenant. This is the character who runs the establishment while the PC is out adventuring and who is a trusted NPC. When pressed, "how did you get this information?" the lieutenant can shrug and say "I didn't collect it personally, one of the workers we employ overheard it."

If the player is persistent and really wants to dig down and get more details, that may be reasonable, but it might also require more work on your part to invent an answer. In which case that's a good reason to ask for another Gather Intel check.

## Favors

Back at the start of this chapter we said you probably had little use for an army or a modified spell, but if you did, shouldn't you be able to spend a little money, help someone out, and earn a favor from them? According to these rules...yes! You temporarily gain the benefit of another stronghold! Once per season, you may spend 1,000 gp to choose a favor below. To do this, you must know someone with the appropriate stronghold who considers you an ally.

### The Keep

You gain 500 points per level of your ally's keep to spend on units for one battle. These units cost you no gold pieces, have no upkeep, but disband after the battle is over. The units may only come from ancestries you and your ally with a keep have access to. You'll find more about the point values of units in "Appendix: Warfare (page 233)".

### The Tower

Choose a modified spell researched by an NPC ally or other party member. You can cast that modified spell a number of times equal to your establishment level before you forget it. Once you forget it, you must pay for another favor in order to cast it again.

### The Temple

Choose an allied NPC or party member with a temple. You can petition their deity and use their concordance once. If you summon a servitor, it remains for a number of rounds equal to your establishment level.

The money for the favor goes to the ally. A PC ally could refuse to grant the favor but they cannot change how much the favor costs. They may want to negotiate better terms, or get something else in return, but the benefits of the favor originate from the establishment and the power of the network of people in your employ to lie, manipulate, and double-deal so that the folks granting the favor think it was their idea. A PC ally therefore might want to name their own terms, ("I will grant you this favor if...,") but if they accept the payment, the establishment's owner gets the favor. As a rule, an NPC ally will not try to negotiate. They will accept the money and the PCs gains the favor.
