# The Temple
*Source: Strongholds and Followers, p. 30* 

The priest, the warlock, the druid all share something in common. They do not get their power through knowledge and study alone, but through access to a higher power. A deity, extraplanar being, or force of nature. The telepathic Wild Men of Ix, for instance, worship Bale, the ever-raging tempest-maelstrom that lies in the ocean between Vasloria and Rioja, north of the Ixian island chain. Sages claim the maelstrom is a hole between worlds, but the Ixian stormspeaker shamans call Bale their god. They pray to it...and their prayers are answered with druidic spells and incantations.

Divine spellcasters have little use for a tower or a keep, but they do build temples. Some are mighty churches, some are underground shrines to their dark god, and some are simple pools of crystal water surrounded by green trees and blessed by rays of sunlight.

Though temples come in many forms, they all share the same basic function. They grant the supplicant a direct line to the object of their worship, and the supernatural entity they call on grants them rewards in exchange for faithful service including access to battle magic ^[Described in Kingdoms & Warfare.], and the temporary aid of a servitor depending on the character's concordance.

## Concordance

The measure of how pleased your deity ^[Or whatever. I can't keep writing "deity or power or abstract concept," you get the idea.] is with you is called **concordance**. If your deity is pleased enough to reward you, then you are referred to as "in concordance" with your deity. If they are *not* pleased, then you are out of concordance. Typically, there is no way to know whether you're in or out before you petition your deity.

Your current concordance is known only to your GM, though you can keep track of your good deeds in case they need to be reminded. It's typically a number from 1 to 100, but you can go above and below that range, even into the negatives.

Of course, the GM can ask you to keep a running tally. So when your character petitions their deity, the GM asks, "Okay, what have you done for your god since the last time you called upon them?" The GM is always free to agree or disagree and can add their own bonuses and penalties. Only the GM knows what the gods' *real* attitudes are, numbers be damned.

### Gaining or Losing Concordance

As you adventure, certain actions can make you gain or lose concordance. Mostly, these are known to your character. Your character knows if they convince an enemy priest to give up their life of evil and join you (very difficult, but long-lasting positive benefits) or kill an enemy cultist (pretty easy, but no lasting consequences) that you are furthering your deity's goals and will be rewarded. *Failing* to act when you have the opportunity will also make you lose concordance.

The gods consider it your responsibility to know right from wrong. If you are tricked by an enemy into doing their bidding, the gods are just as angry at you as they would be if you helped the enemy willingly. They don't pay *very* close attention and don't have time to evaluate the subtleties of situational ethics.

Here are some examples of deeds that would add to or subtract from your current concordance.

> [!note] Divine Intervention
> 
> A cleric's [Divine Intervention](compendium/classes/cleric.md#Divine%20Intervention%20(Level%2010)) is a much-improved version of concordance. Concordance is available to everyone but has a downside and only grants specific rewards. [Divine Intervention](compendium/classes/cleric.md#Divine%20Intervention%20(Level%2010)) only works for clerics, has no downside, and can potentially fix any problem.

## Petitioning your Deity

**As an action, you can petition your deity for aid.** The GM ^[Of course, the GM can let the player roll! Just be aware, a 100 is just as likely as a 1.] rolls percentile dice and adds your current concordance and your current level. **If you have a temple, you gain an extra +30 to your roll.**

You may receive aid, be ignored, or be punished for your repeated badgering. Unless you've been busting your ass (or have a temple), there's a good chance you'll be cursed just for being annoying.

Because the gods do not like being pestered, petitioning your deity, regardless of the outcome, gives you a penalty to your concordance. This penalty will accumulate as you petition again and again. **Track your penalty from petitioning separately.** Taking an extended rest at your temple, if you have one, clears any penalties you've accumulated from petitioning.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/The Concordance Chart.md\|The Concordance Chart]]

### The Servitor Chart

If your concordance result grants you a servitor, determine which servitor arrives by choosing one from the column you rolled.

The servitor you choose must be within your character or deity's purview *and* be approved by the GM. No matter how pious your lawful good paladin is, your god will not grant you a demon, devil, or undead and *probably* nothing from Arcadia or Primordius.

The character who summoned the servitor is informally referred to as the "summoner" or the "petitioner" or more formally "the concordant." The latter term is what the servitors usually use.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Servitors.md\|Servitors]]

#### Picking a Chart for the Player

GMs, one option you have is to let the player roll, but *you* decide which row they're rolling on. The unpredictability of this can be a lot of fun, but be sure to choose thoughtfully. A druid who opposes law (like, roads and civilizations) would obviously be in accord with the Court of Arcadia, but the Court of All Flesh also opposes law. Which servitor arrives may say a lot about the character doing the petitioning!

### Using Your Servitor

The summoned creature is referred to as a servitor. It arrives ready to fight and die, perhaps resentfully, for the concordant. Regardless of its attitude, a servitor only remains on the same plane as the concordant for **four rounds plus one round per level of your stronghold**, returning to their home dimension forthwith. Servitors who are killed in the Mundane World leave their bodies behind, and their essence returns to their home plane to reform there.

Servitors often bring word from the power the concordant serves, informing them of unknown dangers or otherwise making cryptic pronouncements. Feel free to imbue the servitor with personality and give them the chance, during combat, to interact with the heroes.

## Druid Groves

A variant temple, the druid's grove ^[We use the term "grove" both for this variant Temple and as a generic, narrative term for a Druid's stronghold later in the book.] gives up the bonus to concordance for owning a temple in exchange for installing a powerful spell, including spells you don't know or which might not be on the druid spell list, into the grove making it permanent.

The druid chooses one spell from the list below and spends a month in meditation. If the powers that grant them their spells are pleased with their work, they permanently install the spell the druid requested, which can be cast once per period listed in the Grove Spells table.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Grove Spells.md\|Grove Spells]]

The spell belongs to the grove but is cast by the druid. The grove must be continuously tended. Leaving the grove untended for a month causes it to revert to wild nature and the spell dissipates. The Druid who founded the grove doesn't have to be the one to tend it, a lieutenant or follower will do.

The druid may still summon servitors using concordance, they just don't gain a bonus to the roll for owning a temple. The grove uses different rules with different benefits.

The installation of a high-level spell grants the druid who tends the grove power and authority. Local barons and lords may visit hoping the druid will aid them and cast the spell in their benefit. This is a great opportunity for some classical "tit-for-tat" plotting, but now it is the PC who holds the power, and pronounces "I will grant you this boon if you undertake this quest for me," and the NPC must scurry around, trying to earn the favor of our hero!
