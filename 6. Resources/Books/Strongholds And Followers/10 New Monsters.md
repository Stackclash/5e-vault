# New Monsters
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

## Demons

A sufficiently evil character in league with fell powers can use their concordance to summon a fiend of the Abyss. A creature of pure chaotic hate and evil called a Demon. Demons are intelligent, but full an overwhelming desire to destroy those who bind them with summoning.

Fiends, like all creatures, grow in power over time and as a demon collects souls they grow in power. Many demons are listed in the core rules, but two unique to this book are listed below in their lesser forms, still serving their masters, waiting to fulfill their quota of souls and grow into their final forms.

## Devils

Summoned from the Seven Cities of Hell and the wasted lands that separate them, a variety of devils are also available to the owner of a temple. Most of those devils can be found in the core rules, but the Lesser Erinyes is presented below.

Summoned devils arrive aware of the process that brought them to this world, and ready to make a deal once their time is up. The greater devils are aware of the existence of the codex incabulum and greatly desire to bring it to the Seven Cities. They will make any bargain to further this goal.

## The Celestial Court

The deva, planetars, and solars are beings beyond the ken of most mortal worshippers. For mortals worthy of aid, for those who pledge their life to defending the helpless and opposing evil, the gods of good and righteousness send lesser servants, the Celestial Court.

The home realm of the Celestial court is unknown in this day, if the ancient empires knew of it, that knowledge has not yet been rediscovered. Modern sages believe each member of the Court exists as a thought in the minds of the gods of goodness and righteousness and when summoned, they are created. In some sense it is known that the Court of Paradise or Court of Heaven as they are sometimes called serve all the worthy gods. These creatures may have no home plane, unlike the other servitors.

These beings are utterly alien. They are the manifest will of the gods, and their nature is unknowable. They can communicate, but their words are a string of open poetry and verseless rhymes. Scholarly consensus is that these words are untranslatable gibberish, but opinions differ. One problem in translation is that each person who hears any member of the choir invisible speak, hears different words. This led sages for centuries to assume that there was nothing to translate, seeing the mortal mind as incapable of holding the thoughts of the Court in its head.

Others, undaunted, argue that this just means more collation is needed, and that if enough listeners wrote down what they heard, and these transcriptions were compared, meaning—perhaps oracular meaning, warnings of catastrophes to come—would be revealed. All the Celestial Court are angelic beings, and their weapons are considered magical and do bonus radiant damage. They all project an aura of protection against evil.

As far as theologists and philosophers can tell, there's only one of each of these beings. So if you summon a princip, for example, and it casts haste twice before the battle is over, summoning another princip later that day would summon the same one, and it's only got one haste (or remove curse or stoneskin) left. They cannot be killed by any power less than that which kills gods. Death on our plane is just a failure of their manifold projection into the timescape.

## The Court of All Flesh

As with all things in Primordius, the Sea of Eternal Change, the favor of the Lords of Chaos is quixotic and fluctuates constantly. Currently, the six members described here hold the favor of the White King and Red Queen. But the only constant in Primordius is change. At any moment the Court of All Flesh could be rearranged or replaced completely. Warlocks and dark priests of old still consider all these courtiers as newcomers on the stage, and they lament the passing in favor of the Unseeing Karras Vor and the Reflection of Mor-Lu, whom they consider greater and more powerful than these lesser beings.

Formerly the Red Prince, Maladar Dictum schemes to regain his position. Lord Rall, his retainer, and the Queen of Bone would both like to see their prince return to his rightful position beside the Red Queen—or better, they would prefer to see him take her place. But more, even more than that, they each scheme to take their own place on one of the Thrones of Chaos, awaiting the moment when they will betray their lord.

### Unchanging Changers

Members of the Court are beings of pure chaos. Any attempt to force them to change form simply passes through them. There is nothing substantive about them. No quintessence for a spell or ability to manipulate.

### Not Evil

The Changing Ones are not evil. Indeed, they arrive in the Mundane World committed to helping the character who summoned them, even dying for them. They care not for good, nor evil—they are opposed to law, to tyranny, to any force that attempts to slow or stifle change.

## The Court of Arcadia

Once, these creatures served the kings and queens of the high elves in the Great Wode that covered all Orden. Val, their god, walked the land with them. Then, a War Between the Gods, and in the aftermath Val left the Mundane World and took his closest servants with him to their own realm. Arcadia. A paradise of nature, poetry, song, and art.

Arcadia is a perfect, unchanging realm where art is a mirror held to nature. Its denizens are melodramatic, quick to take offense, and they hold grudges for ages. All their rivalries and jealousies come from the most absurdly small things: Which flowers are best for bees to make honey. Which pool best reflects dawn's light to flatter one's profile. Whether jam or butter is best on toast with tea. It seems a kind of madness, and perhaps it is, for the servants of Val no longer have a world to tend. Arcadia tends itself.

As a result, Arcadians relish returning to the Mundane World—they don't want to leave! They love seeing what Men have done with the place, as gauche and déclassé as everything is. Really? A castle there? Is this really the alphabet you write with? My word. What's happened to style? Ah well. It's still better than the perfect boring nothing that Arcadia has become since Val moved there permanently. Technically it's a realm of perfect natural chaos, but the thing about perfect chaos is...it's so predictable. Yawn.

### Servants of Val

The Court of Arcadia were all created by Val to be above his more populous creation, the elves. As such, the Arcadians can command elves and fey with ease. This is in fact their job: to keep the other fey creatures in line and tend the wodes ^[The magical, timeless, elf-haunted forests in my campaign setting.]. Elves don't like being reminded of this, so of course the Arcadians take every opportunity to remind them of it.

### Law Versus Chaos

The Arcadians are servants of Nature. They exist to glorify her. To them, a road is a wound, a knife-cut through the perfect chaos of the natural world. Farms are a disease, infecting the earth by taming it. Forcing it to serve, while its proper place is to be served. Killing the land, making it a slave to man. This is Law.

They hate civilization and all it brings. This is one reason Val left the Mundane World and took his favored with him. Now, Arcadia is an Edenic representation of everything the Arcadians desire: raw, untamed nature as a perfect art.

### Chaos Versus Discord

The servants of Val consider themselves the enemies of both the Knights of Axiom and the Court of All Flesh. Created to serve the high elves, the Arcadians view Nature as a self-evident good. A power they serve above all others.

To them, chaos means freedom, the freedom of a vine to grow where it will and, yes, even destroy and pull down a wall or a gate in time. The low things of the Court of All Flesh are a corrupt, mirror mockery of this. To the Arcadians, the Court of All Flesh represents discord. Chaos twisted into an evil, destructive form.

## The Court of Elements

The Lady of Brass is a notorious adventurer, who often takes her floating Castle of Fire into other planes to do battle with tyrants. In her absence, she leaves her home plane of Quintessence and its greatest city, Alloy, in the hands of her personal guard, the Court of Elements.

The Court patrol Alloy—the Burning City, the City of Four Elements—and enforce the Lady's law. Beings from across the timescape come to Alloy, and many bring their grudges with them. The Lady has spent eons building Alloy's reputation as a neutral city, open to trade and available for loremasters seeking knowledge not available on their home plane. The Court of Elements enforce this order, ensuring the safety of visitors, unless they come seeking conflict.

## Gemstone Dragons

> "Black gods, what is it?"
> 
> The inner sanctum was exactly as they imagined it. A round room, only twenty feet across, but tall, maybe forty or fifty feet tall. Every wall lined with bookcases, every shelf packed with books and scrolls.
> 
> A creature about their size hovered at head level. Just floated in the air with no obvious means of staying aloft. It was a little smaller than a grown man. Its four rear legs curled underneath it. Its tail was wrapped around it, as though to keep warm. It seemed made of flesh, but gemstones studded its skin and glimmered in the lamplight.
> 
> It turned briefly from examining the bookshelf to look at them.
> 
> "What? Oh, hello!" It turned back to the bookcases. "Wondered what all that noise was downstairs. Hope you got it all sorted out."
> 
> They stared at the small creature.
> 
> "It's flying," Meliora said.
> 
> "Ah, levitating, I think you'll find," the creature said, not looking at them. "Although the psychokinetics are more akin to your fly spell, to be sure. You're to be forgiven for not knowing the difference." It glanced at them again briefly. "Do you know where I put the Treatise on Manifold Planes? I was certain I filed it away with the rest of the geometries. Will take me forever to organize this place. And I don't have forever." This last was muttered under its...
> 
> "I...can you all hear that?" Jeremy asked, pressing his hands to his head.
> 
> "It's in my mind," Credan said. "I can hear it between my ears." It wasn't an unpleasant sensation. There was a bit of an echo. The voice seemed to be coming from a cave. Were it not for the incredibly expressive face of the creature, eyebrows raising, eyes darting around, lips frowning or sneering, they wouldn't have connected the voice to the creature.
> 
> The creature floated around. "What?" it asked. "Oh. Well, we topaz develop mindspeech early. It shouldn't cause you any...discomfort." It spoke absentmindedly, tiny hand-like paws fingering the spines of books. A fin atop its head waved slowly in time with tendrils growing from its jaw, as though moved by underwater currents.
> 
> "It's a...I think it's a dragon," Meliora said.
> 
> The creature turned and gave them a knowing look. If it had possessed spectacles, it would have peered over them. "Yes, well done. And you are terrans. Oh that's rude, isn't it? Forgive me. Men."
> 
> "And women!" Wenna exclaimed.
> 
> "Truly?" The dragon turned back to the books. "Well. I cherish my ignorance on the subject."
> 
> "If you're a dragon..." Wenna said, suspiciously, "where are your wings?!" Credan tugged on her linen shirt in a vain attempt to hush her.
> 
> "Hands are better, don't you think?"
> 
> "But how do you fly?" Meliora demanded.
> 
> The dragon turned again to them. It tapped its head with a single finger from its tiny forepaws, then returned to its work.
> 
> "We have to go back," Credan said, now tugging on Dade and Jeremy's makeshift armor.
> 
> "Da needs to know about this."
> 
> The topaz wyrmling turned at this, and stared at them, blinking. Then it made the connection. "You're children!"
> 
> "I'll have eighteen summers this Lyleth," Dade said, standing up straight.
> 
> "Indeed? Fascinating, fascinating. Older than me, when taken in percentages."
> 
> "Older than you?" Meliora stepped forward. She couldn't control her curiosity. Her hands twitched with desire to touch the thing.
> 
> "Yes, well. What is time? I've spent most of the last several thousand years asleep. Lot of that going around, I'm told. Though, of course, not anymore."
> 
> Very little of the conversation made sense to the children. Jeremy looked at Dade. Decided to assert himself.
> 
> "We killed the goblins," he said. "Who infested the tower."
> 
> "Did you!? Well done, well done. Filthy little things, probably a mistake in retrospect. Ah, well that deserves an introduction, I dare say." The creature floated around, following the curve of the round room, lowering itself until its legs, in the daintiest way possible, reached out and touched the ground, supported its weight. Then it fluidly walked toward them, each of its six legs moving like on a well-coordinated marionette.
> 
> "My name is Irdizavonax." The little dragon bowed. When it straightened, it was only a little shorter than Dade. As tall as Jeremy. Taller than the others. "I am the keeper of this tower. Currently. I believe the tradition established by the human wizards who build these things is that, having gained the inner sanctum, you may ask a question."
> 
> They looked at each other. Meliora, as was typical, ventured a response.
> 
> "Well...w-what should we ask?"
> 
> The topaz wyrmling looked around the abandoned wizard's tower, its original owner long dead, then looked back at the children. "No idea!" it exclaimed. "Not my tradition. Perhaps it would be better if I gave you answers first."
> 
> The creature looked at the ground, suddenly somber. Seemed to gather its thoughts. Then it regarded them again with its alien eyes.
> 
> "Your world is in danger," the creature thought at them. "Corovaxinar stirs, and many of my kith and kin awake. I don't need to tell you, this bodes ill."
> 
> "It does?" Jeremy asked, astonished.
> 
> "Alright, I do need to tell you. Someone from another world, perhaps the World Below? Primordius? I can't be certain, I'm new at this. Someone is trying to merge their world with yours. With ours. It's an invasion, you might say. One reality attacking another. If successful, it would mean most of our world would be...rewritten. Replaced. This would be a catastrophe, you understand." It drew itself up proudly.
> 
> "The gemstone dragons intend to stop them. I think...I think it's why we were created, if you would allow me to wax philosophical for a moment."
> 
> Jeremy looked from Wenna to Credan to Dade. Meliora was lost in admiration. He looked back at the dragon. "We don't understand."
> 
> "I'm not surprised. Well, this place is yours now, if it's anyone's. I can teach you what you want to know. Or at least, what you need to know, which is more important. I thought some great human wizard would be here but...perhaps...children are better. Much to learn here and all of it written by your ancestors, not mine. Your Shauraseni Empire rivaled any loremasters of the celestials. Ah, elves, I think you call them.
> 
> "In any event, by right this tower is now yours, and I," it said, bowing again, "am your servant. For the time being at least."
> 
> "Oh my," Wenna said, and the others looked from the dragon to her. She turned to them and beamed.
> 
> "We've been on a quest!"

A long-forgotten branch of the draco genus, draco crystallus are primarily hexapods like their more common cousins draco metallus and draco chromaticus. They are older than the other draconic genii, which accounts for their wider diversity in body type.

Many long ago abandoned their wings or let them atrophy, relying instead on their innate mental powers to lift and propel them telekinetically. They are now rare, hunted for the gemstones that grant them—and, for a brief time, anyone who holds one—their psionic powers. Many have slumbered or hidden from civilization for many thousands of years, only awakening during times of catastrophic need.

They are sages and hoard knowledge rather than treasure and so are often found in or near ancient libraries. Their crystalline structure grants them enhanced speed and agility, their nerve impulses being conducted by the piezoelectric effect rather than mere chemical signals.

As a result they are more agile, and their quasicrystalline skin grants them natural armor. Weapons spark and chip jeweled fragments off their hides but find little purchase there. They are harder to hit and damage but have less raw health than their metallic and chromatic cousins.

They are the keepers of forgotten lore and rarely take sides in the battles between good, evil, law, and chaos. Rather, they act to preserve the world, or knowledge, or to prevent dangerous knowledge from falling into any hands. They come in every flavor of neutral alignment, but if one is neutral good, they're more neutral good than neutral good, if you take my meaning.

Unlike their more barbaric cousins, they rarely have an affinity for one type of terrain over other (the emeralds being an exception) and so their lairs can be found anywhere, caves, dungeons, libraries, cities, clouds, pocket dimensions. There is no such thing as a 'typical,' gemstone dragon lair.

### Psionics

The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.

The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into **manifestations**.

Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.

Over time, the dragon's crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. **At the end of its turns, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.**

Each dragon also has a **Fracture score**. Each time it takes more damage than its Fracture score in a single turn, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon's maximum charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.

#### Manifestations

Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These **manifestations** are the primary source of a gemstone dragon's power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.

The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.

The save DC against a dragon's manifestation is 8 plus the dragon's proficiency bonus plus the dragon's Intelligence modifier.

#### Auras

A dragon projects an aura 30 feet around it. The aura persists while the dragon has psionic charges remaining.

#### Crystal Hide

Normal weapons bounce and spark off the crystals extruding from a gemstone dragon's skin. These dragons are resistant to damage from nonmagical slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing attacks.

#### Sympathetic Vibrations

All gemstone dragons are vulnerable to psychic damage. The same crystalline structure that makes them hard to damage with normal weapons natively conducts any psionic radiation, causing its latticework to crack and shatter.

#### Mindspeech

All gemstone dragons develop telepathy as they age. Most acquire it when they are young, but the topaz dragons are born with it.

#### Matrix Mind

The gemstone dragons can maintain several persistent manifestations simultaneously but doing so requires expending 1 charge per manifestation at the start of each round. Damage disrupts psionic concentration just as it does a spell, but the saving throw is based on Intelligence rather than Constitution.

### Gemstone Dragonborn

Much rarer than their metallic or chromatic cousins, the gemstone dragonborn are the result of powerful rituals. They are proud of their heritage. Because the gemstone dragons are rare, so rare as to be considered mythical, it's not unusual for their humanoid descendants to pursue a great quest to find their ultimate progenitor...or just any gemstone dragon, to get a sense of where they came from and prove the jeweled dragons are real.

> A sound roared and thrummed in their minds. But the creature in front of them was recumbent, sleeping. Still. It looked like a great beast of the plains, satiated after a long hunt.
> 
> The massive sapphire gemstones embedded in and extruding from its skin flashed and coruscated like a lightning storm, arcing along its whole body. And as the young adventurers looked around the cave, with sapphires as big as houses jutting out from all angles, some growing through each other, the jewels of the cave flashed and hummed in response. Sympathetic energies echoed from dragon to cave and back.
> 
> "Behold!" Irdizavonax said, "Corovaxinar!"
> 
> "It's huge," Credan whispered. He and his friends were bathed in deep blue light.
> 
> "It's asleep!" Wenna said.
> 
> "It is in battle," Irdizavonax said.
> 
> "Battle?!" Jeremy asked. "What...it's just lying there."
> 
> "In this realm, yes. But the Eldest are...what did Orvosortiax call it? Realitas? They are too real for one world alone. Corovaxinar exists simultaneously in many worlds. There's a term for the bending of the timescape back upon itself, but I won't bore you with it."
> 
> "Thank you," Meliora said darkly.
> 
> "This is an ancient dragon?" Wenna asked.
> 
> "Any category would shame it. No, I met an ancient emerald once—it wasn't like this. It could still talk and move without...endangering anyone. This is more. This is the Eldest."
> 
> "Battle." Dade watched the creature's internal lightning strikes illuminate them and the cave. "It's fighting something on some other plane."
> 
> "Better there than here!" Credan said.
> 
> "We thought we came here for answers," Jeremy said, looking at Dade.
> 
> Dade looked to the topaz dragon who'd befriended them. "But all we find is violence."
> 
> "Oh, answers often lead to violence," the topaz wyrmling sighed. "It is the way of things."
> 
> They noticed, every time the eldest sapphire dragon's gemstones flashed with deep blue energy, Irdizavonax's fins and tentacles blew in an invisible wind. The light from the eldest sapphire wasn't blinding, but Irdizavonax had to squint to see through whatever powers were bleeding out of the sleeping, embattled dragon.
> 
> "I think...the same things we fought in Blackbottom...wherever they're from...that's where it," Jeremy nodded at the sleeping dragon, "is fighting."
> 
> "How did you figure that out?" Dade asked.
> 
> Jeremy shrugged. "Just seemed obvious."
> 
> "Hmhp," Irdizavonax sniffed.
> 
> "Irdy," Meliora said. The little dragon appeared to ignore her. "This is because of you, isn't it?"
> 
> "Ah, probably," the topaz wyrmling said. "I'm not a theologist, but others have suggested that we topaz were made by Ket to ah...accelerate any potential victory." The little dragon turned to Meliora and smiled. "Accelerate you, you might say. Dumb humans aren't much use to us."
> 
> "What...what happens when we're not around you anymore?" Wenna asked, gripping the handle of her lute tightly.
> 
> "You know the answer. Our name for ourselves is the Carisovantinaar. It means the Quickening of the Way. The sapphire dragons," he said, nodding to Corovaxinar, "project Awe, as is their right as the First Born. The rubies enhance arcanism, as you yourself saw, Meliora, when we fought alongside Orvosortiax.
> 
> "We topaz project...cleverness." It seemed the little dragon was amused.
> 
> "Intelligence," Dade said.
> 
> The topaz dragon looked the eldest boy—certainly a man now, after everything they'd been through—up and down. "Well that remains to be seen," he said. And Dade smiled, recognizing the joke. They'd all gotten used to the little dragon's mode of speech in the last few months.
> 
> "I don't think I like it," Meliora said.
> 
> "Now you know how I feel," Irdy said, smiling.
> 
> "What happens if we wake him up?" Wenna asked.
> 
> "Her, I think you'll find. Oh, I should think it would be the end of this reality," Irdizavonax said casually. "Or at least this version of it. Perhaps something more interesting will come along, that would be nice."
> 
> "The end..." Dade said.
> 
> "Well it's true of all the eldest. I don't mean the creatures of meat and bone you call dragons. Echoes. I mean the real thing. The chromatics, the metallics. The eldest of them sleep to protect the world—the ones remaining do, at any rate. Mostly I think the chromatics sleep because they know how angry their god would be if they dared to wake."
> 
> "But we have to talk to it!" Wenna said. "You saw what happened in Blackbottom! Our town may already be...be erased."
> 
> "There may be other ways." Irdizavonax's tendrils stroked his own chin in thought.
> 
> "Can't you...talk into her head?" Credan asked.
> 
> "Oh of a surety," Irdizavonax said. "But you see we jeweled dragons operate on similar wavelengths. And I am but a lowly wyrmling. Were I to attempt it...attempt it and succeed, she would almost certainly shatter my mind. Nothing personal, you understand." Irdy looked with some awe at the eldest sapphire. "It's just the power of it."
> 
> After a moment lost in overwhelming fascination, Irdy turned to Meliora. "I believe this is your puzzle to solve, young wizard."
> 
> Meliora shook her head. "No," she said, backing away. "Not after the Fane. Not after what that ruby dragon did to me."
> 
> Irdy's tendrils drooped. "I understand," he said. "I'm sorry."
> 
> "Wenna," Jeremy said. "Wenna, what about you?"
> 
> The young girl gripped her lute in a brief panic.
> 
> "Capital! Yes, tiny minstrel, sing us a song!" Irdy said. Wenna cast him a dark look, but without much malice. She knew the dragon liked teasing her.
> 
> Dade smiled and put a hand on her shoulder. "You don't have to, if you don't want to." Had he not, she might have balked. But being condescended to pushed her over the edge. She jerked her shoulder away. "I want to," she said defiantly.
> 
> She tuned her lute and stepped forward. She always seemed frightened, frightened by everything, but music made her bold. Given the nature of her weapons, perhaps the boldest of them all. To face the ancient sapphire demigod, armed only with strings and a song.
> 
> The song was a trifle. Nothing like the tunes the Riojan in Blackbottom taught her. It was a folk song from home, and it made the children glad and homesick.
> 
> Before she could finish the song, a flash of sapphire energy—and a being materialized in mid-stride, walking toward them.
> 
> It was short, at least, shorter than Dade. Lithe. Humanoid in form, but otherwise an insect with brilliant, multifaceted eyes. It bore twin rapiers at its hips and wore emerald green armor that reflected light with a liquid sheen, unlike any substance they'd seen before. It reminded them of a beetle's carapace.
> 
> Its antennae curled and twitched, sensing arcane forces in the air. It seemed full of cocky confidence and daring.
> 
> "A mantis knight!" Irdy exclaimed in delight. "Oh I'd forgotten about them. Well done, old lady."
> 
> Wenna, Dade, and Jeremy had drawn their weapons. Credan started saying a prayer under his breath. Only Meliora did nothing, except wonder. She was already way ahead of them.
> 
> "This isn't real, is it?" She could tell by the way it manifested.
> 
> "Very good," Irdizavonax said with a slight bow. "Well, real is, as Orvosortiax taught you, mostly a collection of habits, and by that standard...this creature is very real."
> 
> The creature stopped before them and bowed, one hand flourishing before it, the opposite leg extended slightly out.
> 
> It spoke. Its voice was gay, like birdsong on a spring morning. "Corovaxinar remembers things that were, things that should have been, and things that might yet be. I am Lady Eweshtleth. I hold the honor of the Gate and the Door."
> 
> The children stared in rapt attention. Only Irdizavonax was not in awe. "They're from the Court of...well, now the Court of Arcadia, I suppose," he said. "But once the Mantis Knights were the chief lieutenants of the elves. Still are, I imagine. Somewhere."
> 
> "So this a...a memory?" Meliora asked.
> 
> "Good guess, but I don't think so. Well, maybe. Rather I suspect this is a real person who lived...or will live, displaced chronographically."
> 
> "What?" Several of the children asked.
> 
> "Oh she's from the past, probably. Or the future." When none of them spoke, Irdy took it upon himself to impress them with the gravity of the situation. "This is the power of the Eldest."
> 
> Meliora looked at the little dragon. Someday...if they succeeded, a million million years from now, Irdy would be like that massive creature slumbering before them. She wondered, privately, if the little dragon would remember them then.
> 
> "Corovaxinar welcomes you," the alien insect-woman spoke in a smooth, assured voice. Quite unlike the absentminded old professor they'd gotten used to in Irdy.
> 
> Everyone looked to Irdy, but Irdy nodded to Meliora.
> 
> "Oh. Ah. Okay, um...hello. Ah, welcome to...our world."
> 
> "A world under siege," the Mantis Knight said to Meliora. "Corovaxinar needs your help."
> 
> "We need hers," Meliora said.
> 
> "A happy mutuality of purpose," the knight said, and bowed its head, smiling.
> 
> "Oh I like her," Irdy said, turning to Dade with a smile.
> 
> "Prepare yourselves," the knight said, drawing herself up.
> 
> "Um...um for what?" Credan asked.
> 
> "The War rages. Corovaxinar's projections falter. But you are not projections."
> 
> "But we're just..." Credan gestured from Wenna to Jeremy. "Kids."
> 
> Lady Eweshtleth raised an eyebrow and one antenna twitched. "Are you now? I think not. You summoned me. You found the hidden fastness of the Eldest when none of your ilk could gain its sanctum.
> 
> "I do not wot of Men. There are none yet, in my time. Or have not been any for millennia. But I deem thee worthy, if any are."
> 
> "'If any are,'" Jeremy echoed, looking at his older brother. Dade shook his head in disbelief.
> 
> "Besides," Lady Eweshtleth said, nodding at the axe on Dade's hip, "you bear The Edge That Severs Souls. A weapon that would master lesser beings."
> 
> "The Soul Carver!" Irdizavonax exclaimed, taking a step back from Dade. "Ah yes! Many threads converge. Much that was hidden is now revealed. Hah! And to think I stood with you when you found it. Ahh, to be alive and young in such a time."
> 
> "We didn't..." Dade said, his hand on the pommel of the axe. "We don't know what that means."
> 
> "Yes well don't let that stop you, by all means. You've managed to do pretty well for yourselves knowing not much more than a bunch of farmers' sons and daughters. No reason to change tactics now."
> 
> "What..." Meliora said, taking a step toward the Mantis Knight. "Where will we be going?"
> 
> The knight cleared her throat, and a portal opened behind her. A swirling, cloudy thing. "I am the Gate and the Door," she said.
> 
> "The door to where?" Meliora challenged.
> 
> "The World Below," Lady Eweshtleth said. The children gasped. They suspected, they feared, but knowing it was another thing altogether.
> 
> "I don't think..." Credan put a hand on the talisman to St. Gryffyn the Stout. "I don't think St. Gryffyn can hear me there."
> 
> Lady Eweshtleth cocked her head as though listening to a voice, which she was, and nodded. "Corovaxinar will maintain the portal and act as a conduit. Your saint will hear your prayers."
> 
> "What will we find there?" Meliora asked.
> 
> Lady Eweshtleth straightened and assumed a dour persona. "Horrors," she said.
> 
> "How can we face them?" Wenna asked.
> 
> "As with all things," Lady Eweshtleth laughed, her dour demeanor gone. She placed a hand on one elven rapier. "With song, spell, and steel."
> 
> She stepped aside and gestured to the portal. Dade and Jeremy looked at each other and then started forward. The others followed.
> 
> At the edge of the portal, they stopped and looked behind them. Irdizavonax hadn't moved. Looking very small now, he stood alone.
> 
> "Aren't you coming with us?" Credan asked.
> 
> "Coming with you? Into that?" The small topaz dragon nodded at the gate. "I beg your pardon! Hardly. No, you've already got Corovaxinar on your side—I would be useless. A trifle. Besides, what use is a young sage compared with five stalwart heroes!" He was teasing them. But he really wasn't going.
> 
> Meliora walked back to him. She'd grown and was now a little taller than the topaz wyrmling. "But we need you," she said, her eyes watering.
> 
> "Ah, you like me, and for that am I flattered, lady. But you do not need me. Think back to all you've done. What hand did I play? A humble narrator, little more. It was your actions, your bravery that led you here. All I did was...explain things frankly that I don't think you needed to know." "We'll miss you," Meliora said, her voice quiet.
> 
> "Well, I'm not going anywhere," Irdizavonax said, looking around the cave. "I'll be safe as houses here. And I'll be waiting, when you come back."
> 
> "Come on," Dade said, not unkindly.
> 
> Meliora nodded and turned. But Irdizavonax stopped her.
> 
> "Meliora," he said, and she turned back.
> 
> "To answer your question," Irdy said, walking forward. His voice in her mind was quiet. She knew only she could hear him now. "I will always remember you," Irdizavonax, the topaz wyrmling, said, his wide milky eyes looking up at her in wonder.
> 
> Meliora started to cry.
> 
> Irdizavonax took a step back and turned his mindspeech back up.
> 
> "Goodbye, tiny humans!" He waved to them as Meliora joined her friends, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her robe. "And good luck."
> 
> The children stepped through the portal. Lady Eweshtleth saluted Irdizavonax with her rapier, and followed.
> 
> "I'll miss you too," Irdizavonax thought, to no one in particular.

## The Inexorables

> "We are the Inexorables," the machine-thing said. "We cannot be corrupted."
> 
> "I know. You said that before. But...I didn't summon you this time." Credan was bolder than his companions had seen before. This was his realm, his business, and when it came to calling on his saint, he was on more secure ground. "What are you...why now? What...?"
> 
> "There has been a disruption. The Law of Time has been violated. I repair."
> 
> "The Law of Time? I...we don't understand."
> 
> "No. It defines you. The sword does not know the meaning of steel."
> 
> "It's talking about Ryllach," Wenna said. "Aren't you? You mean the Monarchon."
> 
> "The servants of Val are agents of chaos. The act that one took was a violation. I repair."
> 
> "You repair? What does that mean?"
> 
> "I repair."
> 
> "It means it's going to kill Ryllach." Dade fingered the arrows in the quiver on his hip.
> 
> "No," Meliora said, gripped with terrible knowledge. "It means it's going to undo what the Monarchon did. It's going to put time back the way it was."
> 
> The children stood rooted to the spot. Horrified by what that meant. "But I..." Jeremy said. "We don't even..."
> 
> Meliora stepped forward. Confronted the Inexorable. "We don't even know what the Law of Time is, how can we be bound to it? How can Ryllach have saved us—she saved the world—how can that be possible if you're right? If there is a Law of Time, how did the Monarchon do what she did?"
> 
> "Time is inexorable." The machine-man of glass and mirror-polished steel didn't move.
> 
> "Irdy, do something," Meliora muttered toward the topaz dragon.
> 
> "By all means! Actually I think you were on rather the right track there. Just have to speak its language, as they say."
> 
> The dragon floated forward, its little hands wringing, its legs tucked underneath it. "You are the Inexorable of Time."
> 
> "The Law of Time is inexorable."
> 
> "Quite. Where are you from?"
> 
> "The third city of Ordos."
> 
> "And where is Ordos?" Irdy said. The little dragon's telekinesis had lifted it up until Irdy was face to face with the Inexorable.
> 
> "Ordos is the capital of Axiom."
> 
> Irdy turned to the gathered children. "The Plane of Uttermost Law."
> 
> The topaz wyrmling turned back and continued his inquisition while the children watched in rapt attention.
> 
> "This is not Axiom. This is the Mundane World, and here law and chaos exist side by side."
> 
> "Nevertheless."
> 
> Irdy floated forward, almost nose to...faceplate with the machine.
> 
> "Consider, Inexorable, that no one here summoned you. No mortal brought you here. And you didn't come here of your own accord. Is it not possible that some other agent, some other power, summoned you on purpose to disrupt our plans?"
> 
> The Inexorable appeared to tense, but otherwise did not move.
> 
> "What would you call that? Trying to disrupt this world, its natural balance, what do they call that in the city of Ordos?"
> 
> The Inexorable looked at the children, who were afraid but standing their ground.
> 
> "Chaos," the Inexorable said, unable to contain the hate it felt for the idea.
> 
> "And if you were manipulated—" Meliora took her place besides Irdizavonax. "—if your presence on this plane, in our world, is a deliberate deceit designed to advance chaos, then what would your purpose dictate?"
> 
> The thing didn't move for several moments. Then its head, banded by a thin black stripe where its eyes would be, turned and look left and right, as though seeing the world for the first time.
> 
> It regarded Meliora again. "Such a power...if it existed...must be neutralized...with extreme prejudice."
> 
> Meliora cocked an eyebrow. "Want some help?"
> 
> Time clenched its fists. "Yes," it said.
> 
> Meliora turned her back to the machine and faced her friends, a lopsided smile on her face. None of them could remember the last time she smiled.
> 
> "Alright," she said. "He's on our side now."

The Inexorables—the Knights of Axiom, the plane of uttermost law—arrive at the summons of those devoted to opposing chaos.

Each Inexorable is charged with enforcing one of the Laws that bind the universe together. They don't bother explaining this, and the nature of these laws and the Inexorables themselves remains a mystery to most mortals, few of whom have ever heard of the Law of Time—or the Law of Death.

Like the Celestial Court, the Inexorables do not have distinct psychologies, being more a manifestation of a deity. So while they can and do speak, it's not clear what their intention in the Mundane World is. They hate the violation of law, this much is clear, but their notion of what counts as a "law" is alien to mortal minds.

How many Inexorables there are, no one knows. Only those who have visited the Five Cities of Ordos, the capital city of Axiom, can say. It is known that there are Inexorables greater and lesser than those described here. Probably there's an Inexorable for the Law of Whichever Side of the USB Cable You Try First Will Always Be the Wrong Side, but it'd be like CR 1/2 and probably an adorable little maniac.

The Inexorables are primarily infantry, eschewing ranged attacks, which limits them severely. The flip side of this is: they're very easy to run.

### Magic Is Chaos

Each Inexorable has their own Law, and there are many Laws. But one force the Inexorables universally hate is magic. Magic is chaos made manifest. Magic is the tool chaos uses to disrupt the world.

Almost all the Inexorables are vulnerable to magic. It interferes with the perfect order of their logic and, moreover, it offends them. Its existence is anathema. Some Inexorables, however, can overcome this revulsion and maintain their purpose in the face of discord.

### Inexorable

The forces of Law that grant the Inexorables the power to travel the planes, arriving when summoned to repair the damaged fabric of reality, also prevent their duty from being interfered with. When it comes to denying the Inexorables the opportunity to pursue their purpose, even the chaos of magic cannot stop them. The Inexorables are immune to any effects that would slow them or deny them actions or movement.
