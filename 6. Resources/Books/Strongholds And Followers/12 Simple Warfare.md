# Simple Warfare
*Source: Strongholds and Followers, p. 243* 

Some groups want to resolve a big battle, but aren't interested in managing units and just want to know "who wins?" For those folks, we present this classic solution, which can resolve a battle of any size in a few minutes.

## Step One: Army Strength

Determine the army strength of each army by adding up the costs of their units. Special units with no cost are worth 400 points. Units who have suffered casualties from previous battles but which are not diminished contribute their full value to the total. Diminished units contribute nothing.

## Step Two: Force Advantage

Now that we know which army is stronger, we need to know: by how much? That means we do a little math. Subtract the smaller army's total from the larger. Then divide the difference by the smaller force. This gives us a percentage measuring how much stronger the stronger army is. This is the stronger army's **force advantage**.

> Lisa's PC Lady Alura Mandrake bought a keep, raised an army and is now taking her army for a stroll into the woods to fight the Necromancer at the Temple of Primordial Chaos. She totals the cost of all her units and get 1,377. The Necromancer's army of undead totals 1,050, a difference of 287. Dividing 287 (the difference) by 1,050 (the force of the smaller army) yields .27 or 27%. Lady Mandrake's army, being larger, begins with a +27% bonus to her roll.

**Strategic Advantages**

| Circumstance | Advantage |
|--------------|-----------|
| Well rested | +10% |
| Well supplied | +10% |
| Defending Homeland | +20% |
| Has beaten this eneMy in The last season | +20% |
| Has beaten this enemy in years past* | +10% |
| Enemy is hereditary | +20% |
| Fighting on favored terrain while The enemy is not | +20% |
| Sunlight sensitivity fighting in daylight | -20% |
| Ambushed** | -30% |
| Defending a fortification | +10% per fortification level |
| Forced march | -10% |
| Lost their previous battle | -20% |
| Lost a battle this season | -10% |
| Poorly supplied | -10% |
| In enemy territory | -20% |

* Does not stack with the bonus above it.

** That is, surprised by an enemy who are themselves not surprised.

> What counts as a hereditary enemy? What determines how well supplied an army is? These factors are generally left to the GM. But once you have armies moving around in your campaign, especially armies controlled by players, it starts to become clearer whether, for instance, an army is poorly supplied or not. "You're marching through the hills, there are no farms and little game, how are you going to feed your army?" is a perfectly reasonable question for the GM to ask, and the answer determines whether the army is poorly supplied. Elves and dwarves aren't automatically hereditary enemies, but these elves who live next to those dwarves in your campaign very well could be!

> *Kingdoms & Warfare* ^[*Kingdoms & Warfare* by Matt Colville is currently unconverted for 5etools.] will go into detail into these subjects, but just knowing it's possible for an army to be ambushed or defending their homeland can help grease the wheels of imagination.

## Step Three: Strategic Advantage

We need to know all the strategic advantages each army has based on the circumstances of battle. Include all that apply from the table on the left:

> Lisa's army is well rested (+10%) but poorly supplied (–10%) and in enemy territory (–20%) for a total strategic advantage of–20%. The necromancer's troops are defending a 3rd-level tower (+30%) but are undead and so have no homeland to defend.

## Step Four: Combat

Roll Each side rolls percentile dice. This is their combat roll.

## Step Five: Advantages

Both sides add their strategic advantage to their combat roll. The larger army also adds their force advantage.

## Step Six: Victory and Defeat

The army with the larger total is the victor. The difference is the degree of victory.

> Lisa and the GM both roll percentile dice. Lisa rolls a 71, and the GM rolls a 38. Lisa adds her +27 force advantage and subtracts her–20% strategic advantage for a total of 78 (71 + 27–20). The GM adds his +30% strategic advantage for a total of 68 (38 + 30). Lisa wins, but only by 10%! (78 vs 68). This is a pyrrhic victory.

## Step Seven: Casualty Determination

Now we figure out which of your units will inflict casualties. Use the chart below to determine which of your units inflicted casualties, and roll dice for them based on each unit's size.

> Lisa won a pyrrhic victory. She has one unit of Levies, size 1d8, and four units of Infantry sized 1d4, 1d4, 1d6, and 1d8. She rolls all these dice for a total of 15 casualties inflicted. The necromancer has two units of Infantry, both 1d6. He rolls both these dice for a total of 8.

## Step Eight: Inflict Casualties

Inflict casualties. Distribute the casualties you suffered among your units according to the Order of Battle: Levies, then Infantry, then Archers, then Cavalry, then Flying.

> Lisa suffered 8 casualties from the necromancer's army. She has to assign them to her levies first, which eliminates her levies (size `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`)). She has assigned all her casualties, lost her levies, but still has the rest of her army.
> 
> The GM takes the 15 casualties Lisa inflicted, and assigns 12 casualties to his levies. He has two levy units, zombies sized 1d8 and skeletons sized 1d10, he assigns 7 casualties to the zombies and 8 casualties to the skeletons. They're both still in the conflict and can absorb more casualties, but because they are now diminished, they no longer contribute to their army's strength total in step one.
> 
> Lisa won the battle, but not by enough points to ensure a clear victory. She has lost her levies and even though the necromancer took more casualties, he had so many zombies and skeletons that his levies are still in the battle and can absorb more damage.

## Step Nine: Retreats

Determine retreats. If an army loses all their infantry, they immediately retreat. If both sides retreat, neither side wins objectives ^[Determined by the GM—for example, why was Lady Mandrake attacking the necromancer?]. Either side can, at this point, choose to retreat and quit the field, granting the opposing side a victory and yielding any objectives. If either side retreats, the battle is over. Otherwise, return to step one, and fight another battle.
