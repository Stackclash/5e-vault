# The Keep
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

The keep ^[There's a great, by which I mean deeply weird, movie from Michael Mann called The Keep about a bunch of Nazis accidently letting a demon lose in Transylvania while an Eternal Man tries to stop them. This doesn't have anything to do with these rules, but it's my book, you get my weirdness.] sits on a hill. It may be tall or squat, but it projects power. It protects. It is a symbol. It says "I am here, and this place is mine. These people, this land, is under my protection."

Unless you don't want it to be, of course—it's your keep, do what you want. Put your keep in a valley if you like, hide it in a forest. But notice that the above language makes no *moral* evaluation. A good ruler, an evil one, might each say the same thing but for different reasons.

## People Know It's There

Let's imagine you want to build a hidden keep—without using powerful magics. This is ahistorical, so if one of my players brought this up, I would explain to them something of the nature and purpose of keeps, and how hard (indeed, I think basically impossible) it is to build *anything* of this size and scale without everyone in the local area knowing.

It takes hundreds of workers months to build a keep, even if you're only repairing an existing fortification. And those workers have homes and families, and while they may eventually move onto your land—perhaps because you are a good ruler, or just because it's convenient to live near where they're spending months working—those people are going to talk about what they're building.

But if, after that, I saw the player still thought it would be cool to build a hidden keep, I would just ask, "Okay, cool, given that it's going to take a lot of people to make it, how do you plan on keeping it secret?" I wouldn't say no; I would just give the player a chance to think about it and be creative. Any answer they give will bring opportunities for drama!

So in general, building any kind of stronghold makes a statement. But a keep is a military fortification. It's not used for researching the mysteries of the universe, or communing with the powers of creation, or raising money and learning secrets, it's about raising an army. Giving your army somewhere to live. Protecting your people and enforcing your will abroad. Historically, keeps were built as a defense *against* armies, a safe and easily defensible location. But in all instances the keep is related to war in a way the other strongholds are not.

So, you build a keep because you want to raise an army and give them a place to stay and train.

## Raising Units

You can **attract** a unit by rolling on your class's followers chart. Some classes are naturally more martial than others—the fighter and paladin attract units more easily than the Wizard and Sorcerer. But even a fell-countenanced warlock like Graves, the Empty One, from my Shield of Gravesford campaign could attract a unit with a good roll. That would be a very interesting army—come to pledge service to a warlock!

Furthermore, you can spend gold to just **buy** a unit. But units not only cost money to buy, they also cost money to maintain, called **upkeep**. Anyone with enough money can maintain an army without a stronghold, it just costs a lot of money. Napoleon did it quite well and would have gotten away with it if it weren't for a plague of typhus ^[That's real, by the way. Popularly, Napoleon blundered into Russia and lost because he, an experienced soldier who'd built an army that kept mobile by foraging, somehow forgot about the phenomenon called "winter." But in actuality Napoleon lost 80,000 men in the first month of the campaign to typhus spread by lice. I suspect many victorious generals would have had a bad time if they lost 80,000 men to disease in one month.].

A keep reduces the cost to buy units by 10% per level, and it also reduces the upkeep of units by 10% per level. This means a 5th-level keep reduces both the cost to buy units and their upkeep cost by 50%.

**Upon finishing a keep, you gain units equal in number to 2 plus the keep level**. At the GM's discretion, if you're building a keep above 1st level, you could get your first unit when you begin construction, another unit halfway through, and the rest when it's complete. There could be good, dramatic reasons for this, and also it gives you a unit early that you can go annoy your neighbors with. And it's perfectly reasonable to presume the half-finished keep is complete *enough* to house *some* folks.

Which units arrive to pledge service is up to the GM, but there's a handy chart on the next page should they want to leave the choice to fate. Newly raised units start at Size 1d4. If you get the same result twice  ^[Actually very likely, as some units are simply much more common than others], just increase the unit's Size by one.

All units raised are of the same ancestry as the owner of the keep.

Use the rules in "Creating Your Own Units" (page 235) to build the unit cards once you know which unit you've attracted.

## Training

A keep means an army, and an army requires training! As you train your soldiers, you get better with your own gear, gaining the following bonuses based on the weapons or armor that you use. Choose one of the following training benefits.

You cannot gain the benefit of training from armor, shields, or weapons you are not proficient in. You can change which training you receive during an "extended rest" (page 15).

**Light Armor Training:** You have advantage on Dexterity checks while wearing light armor.

**Medium Armor Training:** You gain 5 feet of extra movement while wearing medium armor. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity ^[In other words, you can move one more square, and you can choose any one square in your movement that you can leave without provoking. ].

**Heavy Armor Training:** You learn to present your most heavily armored facing to your foes. Ranged attacks have disadvantage against you as crossbow bolts bounce and acid arrows splash harmlessly (sometimes) off your armor.

**Bludgeoning Training:** When you score a critical hit, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the start of your next turn.

**Finesse Training:** When an adjacent enemy damages you with a melee weapon, you may, as a reaction, make a melee attack against them with your wielded finesse weapon.

**Piercing Training:** You deal an extra 1d6 damage to creatures wearing heavy armor.

**Reach Training:** If you hit with a reach weapon, you can move the target 5 feet, but they must remain within your reach. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Shield Training:** If you succeed in a weapon attack while wielding a shield, you can push your target 5 feet away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Slashing Training:** You deal an extra 1d6 damage to creatures wearing light, natural, or no armor.

**Versatile Training:** While wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain +1 AC.

## The Barbarian Camp

Barbarians are famous for keeps! In that under no circumstance would they ever build one. They are why other people build keeps! To a barbarian, the idea of putting all your men in an immobile walled jail seems ridiculous.

Of course, strictly speaking anyone can build any stronghold. And what counts as a "barbarian" has nothing to do with what's on your character sheet. You can easily be a fighter or ranger who looks and behaves in a classical barbarian mode.

But if you want a rampaging horde, you want a barbarian camp. Accept no substitutes.

### Substitutes for a Barbarian Camp

These rules show how a mobile stronghold behaves based on certain assumptions about a Rampaging Horde. With a little imagination, we can easily picture any number of other strongholds that might use these rules.

A druid might decide to go on the warpath, Awaken the Trees, and lead them to war! Do the Awakened Trees have a permanent stronghold? They could, but they could just as easily have a mobile camp!

A monk might eschew a permanent stronghold and instead wander the land, inciting the peasantry to take up arms against their tyrannical lords and join her. Did Joan of Arc have a permanent fortification? Or was she basically leading a barbarian horde?

A barbarian camp functions as a keep with the following differences:

- It still costs gold, but half as much. Temporary wells must be dug, skins for tents must be constantly made and repaired. Weapons and armor still need repairs. Large tents require many wooden stakes. And foraging includes buying food off the locals as well as stealing it. When you're on the move, you basically have to do everything all the time to keep everyone fed and housed. The Mongols had mobile smithies and carpenter shops!  
- It raises units just like a keep, but using the Barbarian Units chart on the previous page.  
- It grants no discount to upkeep.  
- It can *move* a number of provinces ^[Provinces, Unrest, Population Centers, and Development Levels are all in Kingdoms & Warfare. I know it's kinda bogus to put rules in here you can't use yet, but I didn't want the benefits of a Barbarian camp spread out over two books.] per season *inversely proportional* to its size. A 1st-level barbarian camp can move 5 provinces per season. A 5th-level camp, only one. As long as *all* their units are Light, they do not suffer movement penalties for moving in Wilderness. But they do suffer normal movement penalties based on terrain.  
- If a Barbarian camp spends one season in a civilized province, the owner of that province must make an Unrest check against DC 13. If the Development Level of the Province is greater than the level of the Barbarian camp, the roll has advantage. If it is less, then the roll has disadvantage.  

If the province fails its Unrest check, it loses one development level. If this reduces it to 0 it reverts to Wilderness and no longer produces resources for its owner.

Of course, spending a season there means withstanding the owner's own armies. We're basically talking about an invasion.

## The Pirate Ship

![[6. Resources/Books/Strongholds And Followers/img/pirate-ship.webp#center]]

Another variation of the Keep is the dreaded Pirate Ship. The Pirate Ship (a galleon, but one dedicated to piracy) is a mobile stronghold like the Barbarian camp. But while the Barbarian camp gets slower the larger it is, a Pirate Ship gets faster! Its larger sails resist the wind much more efficiently than the larger hull drags through the water. ^[This is actually true. The development of larger sails and the ability to tack into the wind led to the development of the galleon, which was faster than its smaller cousins. Galleons became so big, and could carry so much gold and spice, they became easy pickings for enemy privateers, and thus was the age of piracy born.]

The Pirate Ship functions as a Keep with the following differences.

- It attracts units just like a keep, but with restrictions to their Size. The ship may not carry units larger than Size 1d6. If rolling on the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Training Units Raised By Keep.md\|Units Raised by Keep]] chart (page 17) would produce a unit larger than Size 1d6, roll again. The ship can hold and no more units than its stronghold level. A fully upgraded Pirate Ship (level 5) could therefore carry five units. There is no restriction on the type of units a Pirate Ship may carry.  
- The ship can move five sea hexes per day ^[ Assuming a 24-mile hex.], plus one hex per level of the ship.  
- If the ship sacks (i.e wins a battle against) a port settlement, the settlement's Development Level is downgraded by one.  
- Spending a week in a port settlement generates 100 gp.
