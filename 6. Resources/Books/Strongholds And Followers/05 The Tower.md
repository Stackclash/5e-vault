# The Tower
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

Magic is dangerous. Unpredictable. But there's something even more dangerous: magical research. This is why wizards and other arcane spellcasters put their towers far away from civilization: so they can experiment, and if they summon something with a number of tentacles and eyeballs that can only be expressed through the use of imaginary numbers, the only person who ends up wearing their organs on the outside is the hapless wizard who failed to say all the right words in the right order.

Mind you, lots of big fantasy cities have towers full of wizards, but I always assume that comes with the danger of occasionally summoning hordes of unspeakable monstrosities from the World Below. I mean, you've got all these knights sitting around, might as well give them something to do!

Founding a tower unlocks battle magic ^[Described in Kingdoms & Warfare.]  for them and grants the arcane spellcaster the power to research new spells! And if you use our rules, there is a 0% chance things could go wrong. Well, it's close to 0%, I don't know your GM.

## Spell Research

We know player characters can invent spells—we see them throughout the text of the core game. Famous wizard PCs in the 1970s and the spells their players invented have been with us for the entire history of the game.

So we know it can be done, and it has been done, but back in the day the player would just tell the GM what their idea for a spell was, and the GM would come up with some suitably dangerous and heroic quest to acquire the ingredients and lore for the research, and then, quest complete, the GM would figure out the level of the spell to balance it.

You can still do this and, indeed, you don't really need rules for it. It's the kind of thing you do because there are no rules for it.

The core books have rules for creating new spells, but they're in the back and I don't get the sense they're widely used. They also rely on a combination of player initiative (first, think of a new spell that isn't already covered by one of the hundreds in the game) and GM approval (and the GM has to find a way to balance it, which is probably not fun), and if you're already doing that, do you need those rules? They're mostly just guidelines for how much damage spells do at which level.

Spell research should be fun, and one of the reasons it's fun is that it's *unpredictable*. My all-time favorite chart is the old Potion Miscibility table, which I wanted to roll on not because really good things could happen, but because really good things *and* really bad things could happen! Sometimes simultaneously! Any result was exciting and dramatic, and even if my character exploded, I would have been delighted.

This spell research system is all about rolling on charts, because in my experience as a player, when I see charts like the Potion Miscibility table or the Wild Magic chart, or the old-school Wand of Wonder chart, I just *want* to roll on them.

In this book, all the results of spell research benefit the caster, but not all of them are equally useful, and some of them are Weird. But because these benefits are *rewards* for building a stronghold, there are no bad results.

## Inventing a New Spell

Inventing a new spell from scratch is sort of a pain in the ass and hard to balance and requires a unique combination of player ingenuity and GM balancing that can be a lot of work and not all of it fun.

But *researching* an existing spell? Taking a heretofore boring spell and making it do something extra and neat and maybe weird? Going into your research laboratory and not knowing exactly what you're going to get when you come out? That's *magical*. Here's how it works.

### Pick a Spell

You can only research arcane spells, not divine spells—gods get really bitchy if you start trying to monkey with their ineffable Will. This means the spell must be on the spell list of the bard, eldritch knight, wizard, warlock, or sorcerer. 5th Edition doesn't really have the clear division of arcane and divine spells, but you'll notice that it doesn't give clerics or druids or paladins access to spells with someone's name in the title. Named spells are apparently, unique to "arcane spellcasters," and we like that tradition.

The GM can, of course, allow a divine character to research spells, and why not. It's just not the default assumption.

You must be able to cast the spell you want to research, and the spell can't have a proper name in it.

You may choose to research a cantrip, but the researched cantrip will be a 1st-level spell (see "Casting the Spell" on page 27).

### Pick the Target of the Spell

These categories aren't comprehensive, but broadly applicable. Some spells may fall under multiple categories. "Does damage" applies to many spells that also fit elsewhere on the list. The goal is to let the player choose the category, and the GM interprets the exact target broadly. 

The target of the spell can be:

- Yourself or one ally  
- One enemy  
- All bad guys in an area  
- All allies in an area  
- The spell does damage  

Some spells don't fit into any of these categories, typically ones that bestow knowledge or that summon or create things. For such spells, the above list has enough effects that you could easily choose something from it or even create a unique list by picking and choosing effects below for a player to roll, but **we recommend "yourself or one ally" for spells that don't otherwise fit a category** since presumably the spellcaster is benefitting in some way from the spell.

### Research

Researching a spell takes time and money. The money is spent buying arcane materials to use as prospective components. Many potential components must be tested to determine which is the proper one for this new spell. Special tomes must be procured describing the creation of the original spell, pointing the way towards a means to modify it.

The time spent takes 8 hours of every day, six days a week. The arcanist is able to take breaks a few times each day to speak with their lieutenant and command their followers, oversee the construction of their tower, but they spend the required time in research. If this time is interrupted, the new spells slips from their mind and they must start again.

**To research a spell, the magic-user must spend 1 month, plus 1 week per level of the spell, minus 1 week per level of their tower.**

Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|Vampiric Touch]] is a 3rd-level spell, and the Helltower is a 1st-level tower. Thus, researching it will take 6 weeks: the base time of 4 weeks, plus 3 weeks because [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] is a 3rd-level spell , minus 1 week because his tower is 1st level.

### Find the Chart, Roll or Pick

After picking the spell and its target, and researching it for the appropriate time, the magic-user rolls a d8 on the chart corresponding to its effect to discover the result of their research. This is the default use of these rules and tends to produce the best result.

If the GM and player agree, the player can just choose the effect they want—though this is much more prone to abuse. And, of course, the GM can roll *for* the player. This is a very old-school way of doing things, and while it may seem less satisfying for the player, it lets the GM curate the result.

The GM might, for instance, know or strongly suspect that *one* of the possible results would just be less satisfying for the player and make sure that result doesn't come up. They might still roll! And just pick the next or previous result on the list if they get an unsatisfactory result.

The player spent a lot of their character's money and time to get this, so while some weird results can be fun, and the player should be reminded they can do more research later, the ultimate goal is to give the player a fun reward.

Some of these results are *weird*. This is by design, meant to reinforce the idea that magic is unpredictable. It's not a science. That's why they call it magic.

| dice: d8 | Spell Effect |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Empowering:** For 10 minutes, a random ability score of the target increases to 20. |
| 2 | **Regenerating:** For the spell's duration, the target regains hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier at the start of each round. |
| 3 | **Mindful:** For 10 minutes, the target may use your spellcasting ability modifier for all saving throws. |
| 4 | **Omniscient:** For 10 minutes, the target grows a third eye that reveals hidden, disguised, and invisible creatures within 60 feet, but not objects on other planes. |

The odds of teleporting are cumulative (33% chance on the first round, 66% on the second, 100% on the third), but the odds reset each time the target teleports. The target can choose not to teleport, but if they do so, the odds still reset. |
| 8 | **Blazing:** Until the start of their next turn, the target's movement leaves a trail of fire that lasts for the spell's duration and does 3d6 damage (Dexterity save for half) to anyone who begins their turn in it or moves into or through it. |

| 5 | **Fated:** Until the start of their next turn, targets may reroll damage rolls and may take the new roll. |
| 6 | **Vengeful:** For 10 minutes, targets gain a reaction they may use to attack any enemies who damage them. |

| 2 | **Thunderous:** Affected targets are pushed 10 feet back. |
| 3 | **Defiling:**  Roll 1d6. All affected targets take that much damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the total damage done to the targets. |
| 4 | **Immobilizing:** Roots the targets to their current spots until the start of their next turn. They are grappled. |
| 5 | **Blinding:** Flesh grows over the targets' eyeballs. They are blind for one round per tower level. |

^the-spell-targets-several-enemies

## Does Damage

Find your damage type on the list below.

- (Acid) **Melting**: Objects carried by the target are hit and take damage equal to the spell's damage.  
- (Bludgeoning) Sundering: For the spell's duration, armor worn by the targets degrades by 2. Sundering effects do not stack.  
- (Cold) **Chilling**: Affected targets are grappled until the end of their next turn.  
- (Fire) **Incinerating**: Affected targets continue to burn, taking an extra `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) damage at the start of each round until they spend an action extinguishing the flames.  
- (Force) **Detonating**: Affected targets are knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]]. On their next turn, they must make a Wisdom saving throw to stand up. On their following turn, they may stand up normally without making a save.  
- (Lightning) **Shocking**: Affected targets have disadvantage on all saving throws until the end of your next turn.  
- (Necrotic) **Unholy**: ^[Yeah I know some folks don't consider raising the dead to be evil or "unholy."] `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) ghouls rise from the ground, each anywhere you choose within 30 feet. They obey your commands for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting modifier, then crumble to dust.  
- (Piercing) **Puncturing**: For 10 minutes, weapon attacks against affected targets score critical hits on attack rolls of 15 or higher ^[In other words, your spell creates a "weak spot" in the target's armor or hide that others can exploit.]  
- (Poison) **Nauseating**: Affected targets forgo their next turn, spending it vomiting.  
- (Psychic) **Hallucinating**: On their next turn, the targets perceive allies as enemies and enemies as allies, and act accordingly.  
- (Radiant) **Dazzling**: Each target is blind until the end of its next turn.  
- (Slashing) **Wounding**: Each target takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) damage at the end of its next turn.  
- (Thunder) **Concussive**: The targets are pushed 20 feet back.  

### "I Got a Result I Don't Like"

Alright, look. The whole point of this system is to reward your players for spending the time and money (and frankly, just having the desire) to build a stronghold, so if you think there's *any danger* your player might reject the result, maybe just let them pick. Or roll behind the screen for them and make sure they get a result you know they'll like.

The whole point of rolling is to make the result seem like *fate*. Like it came from forces beyond you or your player's control. It helps trick us into feeling like the rules are describing a real world. But that sense of verisimilitude isn't as important as the player feeling like they got a cool reward for their effort.

### More Research

**A given spell can only be modified by research once, and a given magic-user can only modify a number of spells equal to their tower level.**

**Spell research cannot grant you access to spell levels your class does not have**. You may research a 4th-level spell to produce a 5th-level spell you cannot cast yet, but will be able to once you level up—your research shows the spells exists, but you haven't properly mastered it yet. However, you cannot research a 5th-level spell, producing a 6th-level spell, if your class can never access 6th-level spells.

Besides these limits, the player is free to do more research later. The GM should let the player live with the new spell for a while and, if they don't like the result, "forget" that research and work on another spell. The goal is to empower the players and make their stronghold feel powerful and useful!

If the player likes the result, they should be free to **choose the same spell modifier** for subsequent spell research.

Once a character has a signature spell, especially after they've used it in the wild a few times, rumors of its existence begin to circulate and eventually it's possible, even inevitable, that another spellcaster might reverse-engineer how this custom spell was done and duplicate it. Scrolls of Reginam's omniscient eye might begin circulating. Enemy spellcasters might start using it against the heroes!

Your character is automatically resistant to the effects of any spell you research. Reginam, therefore, has advantage on saving throws against Reginam's omniscient eye. It will still work, even against the wizard who invented it! It's just much less likely to work.

### Casting the Spell

Now the magic-user has their own spell! Velorin's blazing gaseous form! Elemein's overwhelming hypnotic pattern! **The level of the final spell is one higher than the level of the original spell**.

If the target of a spell saves against it, the modifier automatically fails. If the target of a betraying charm person makes their Wisdom save against the charm, they do not suffer the "betraying" effect.

The effects of a modified spell cannot be combined with the effects of the unmodified spell. The temporary hit points gained from mindful enhance ability do not stack with enhance ability for instance. An enlarged character cannot be further enlarged by casting regenerating enlarge.

Spells that can be cast as a ritual can be modified, but this does not change the duration of their effect. Empowering Commune cast as a ritual takes 10 minutes to cast, but the Empowering benefit still only lasts 10 minutes after that.

There's one other restriction: the magic-user can only cast the spell a number of times equal to their spellcasting modifier. Once they do, they must take an extended rest if they want to cast the spell again.

### Future Use of the Spell

As the magic-user casts the spell and learns its new nature, the GM may discover the spell is perhaps not as useful as everyone might like, or it might be *too* useful. The GM is free to modify the spell over time, adjusting its effects, changing the spell level. This represents the magic-user's changing understanding of the spell. Efficiencies are discovered. Some elements of the arcane formula, once clear, begin to slip from the spellcaster's mind as the spell itself twists and writhes under human attention.

Once the GM deems the spell to be grown up and ready to enter the wide world outside the magic-user and their tower, and presuming the player is also happy with it—remember, balance aside, the final result of this process is a *reward* for the player—the GM may decree that the spell is now well studied and available to other spellcasters to learn, and it can be scribed onto scrolls and copied into spellbooks.

Congratulations, you have added to the growing body of spellcraft knowledge! May the gods have mercy on your victims!

## Alternative Tower Rules: Towers by School

Here are some simple rules for towers by school, in case you don't like the spell research system.

Upon finishing a tower, the magic-user must dedicate it to one of the eight schools of magic. It is traditional to give your tower a name based on the school—like, if you choose Divination, you might call your stronghold a Tower of Prophecy. Necromancy...well, a Tower of Necromancy is pretty cool, but also the Tower of Death is pretty badass. Or the Black Tower, or the Tower of Pale Flesh. You get the idea.

**A magic-user who studies at their tower for a week can prepare and cast spells from their tower's school as if the spell were cast at one level higher**. In other words, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]], studied by a 5th-level warlock with an evocation tower, would cast as a 4th-level spell and do an extra 1d6 damage, even though the warlock was using a 3rd-level slot.

**A magic-user can only prepare spells in this way a number of times equal to the level of their tower** (so typically once when starting out). After this, they must return home and spend a week researching in their tower.

> Velorin finishes his tower and dedicates it to necromancy. He memorizes [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]] at 3rd level, but when he casts it, it behaves in all other ways like a 4th-level spell, extending the duration to "concentration."
> 
> All the necromancy spells he casts that day are cast as though they were one level higher. But because his tower is only 1st level, he cannot prepare his necromantic spells this way again until he spends a week in his tower. After upgrading to a 2nd-level tower, he may now spend 2 days casting necromantic spells at higher level.

You could, of course, decide that towers in your campaign grant both these benefits **and** spell research (see below).

### Optional Rule: Effort

Another method I've used and enjoyed allows the magic-user to cast their specialist spells as though they were one level higher with no limit (other than the normal limits of spells by level per day), but **each time they cast a spell at a higher level, they must make a Constitution check of DC 10 plus the spell's level**. If they fail, they suffer one level of exhaustion. A full rest removes one level of exhaustion.
