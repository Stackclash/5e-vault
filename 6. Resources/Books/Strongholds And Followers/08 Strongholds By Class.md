# Strongholds by Class
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

Regardless of whether you build a keep, a tower, a temple, or an establishment, your stronghold improves your signature class ability, and attracts followers based on your class.

The stronghold for each class has a dramatic name—a "bard's theater," a "monk's monastery." But these names are merely examples chosen for flavor, you are free to imagine and name your stronghold in whatever manner seems best to you. Maybe your bard owns a library! Fantastic excuse to get folks coming in and out each dropping off useful nuggets of information. Maybe your barbarian prefers calling it their Horde rather than a camp! It's entirely up to you.

Furthermore, many of the following abilities reference alignment, but that's purely because I'm old-fashioned and prefer the era when paladins fought for good, and I always assume warlocks are sinister. Feel free to reinterpret the abilities so they benefit you and your allies and harm your enemies, however they're defined.

## The Ruler and the Land Are One

Owning a stronghold, leading people, inspires you and grants you insight. It also allows you to draw power from the land itself. The land you protect serves you just as the workers who built your keep, and you in turn protect the land just as you protect your peasants and serfs ^[Not very egalitarian, but accurate. Besides, the traditional relationship between the lord and the people who worked the land was a lot less exploitative than people think.].

This mystical connection manifests in actual power. When your druid takes on the form of a bear and gains fire breath, or your paladin's sword cuts through the enemy defenses, this is the power of the land itself coursing through you. Rewarding you for your protection of it.

The ruler feels this and knows when the land is ill. The connection between the ruler and their land is real and palpable.

The area governed by a stronghold is called a demesne (deh-MAYNE) and grows as the stronghold does, expanding the owner's rule in a radius of hexes equal to the stronghold level. Kingdoms & Warfare will have many more rules for this. The system in both books assumes a 24-mile hex, so all powers affect a 12-mile radius per stronghold level.

## Demesne Effects and Stronghold Actions

The power of a stronghold changes the land around it in dramatic and sometimes mechanically interesting ways. As the regent of the land, you'll gain new abilities that only work within your stronghold, the nexus of your power. These stronghold actions are epic! But don't worry, GMs—stronghold actions only work inside the stronghold (unless otherwise noted), so there's no danger the player will use them to unbalance your game.

Building a stronghold makes a statement. You make allies, but also enemies. Having some of those enemies attack the player in their stronghold, perhaps infiltrating it under cover of night, perhaps gaining entrance under guise of some diplomatic or trade mission, gives the player a chance to feel really badass, which is a core element of this fantasy we're all engaging with.

**Whenever a stronghold action or demense effect prompts a saving throw, its DC is the stronghold owner's spellcasting DC, unless otherwise noted.**

Players may be tempted to abuse their stronghold actions, using them to show off in inappropriate circumstances. Should they abuse this privilege, they may find the land they serve and which grants them this power has limited resources and even less patience.

## Class Feature Improvements

Founding a stronghold improves your class' signature feature as your new demesne grants you power. Typically this improved class feature has a limited number of uses (based on your stronghold level, usually) after which you must take an "extended rest" (page 15) to refresh the ability.

**Multiclass characters can choose any one of their class abilities to improve, and change this selection after an extended rest.**

## Different Classes, Different Followers

Each class has its own unique follower chart, listed below. These charts make certain assumptions about how the different classes are each perceived by society. Two classes may be equally effective in combat, but that doesn't say anything about how the local artisans or infantry company feel about them.

Some classes have a wider range of results. Paladins can gain more different followers than Sorcerers. This reflects how normal people view the different classes. Paladins and fighters and clerics tend to be respected, trusted. If they have spells, they often use them to help and heal. But peasants don't react well to sorcery, to arcane knowledge Man Was Not Meant to Know!

The follower options for each class reflect this. Martial classes are more likely to get military units, while classes that use sorcery and delve into hidden places or research forgotten lore are more likely to get [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Special Allies (SAF).md\|special allies]] (page 67).

These cultural assumptions reflect the default Fantasyland campaign setting, but the assumptions of your setting may be very different. GMs, you can adjust these charts to reflect your world's assumptions or even let players roll on a chart for a different class if it makes more sense!

**Multiclass characters can roll on any chart for which they have class levels.**

**The follower charts in this chapter are meant to inspire you, not limit you.** They are based on assumptions, some of which you may not agree with! For instance, I tend to think of rangers and rogues as being sneaky, guerilla-type characters, so in this system they cannot attract an agent of law like a paladin. But I don't know your campaign or your characters! By all means, if you think your player's ranger would attract a paladin follower, feel free to change their follower chart. Or just award them a paladin follower. No need to roll!

## When to Roll

The GM decides when the player gets to roll on a follower chart. Here are some typical times to roll:

- When the PC spends the money for a stronghold and starts construction  
- When construction of the stronghold finishes  
- When the PC improves (i.e., levels up) a finished stronghold  
- When the PC levels up  

the player roll when they improve their stronghold and when they level their character up, for example. It's more about pacing than anything else. I think a good pace is one roll to attract followers per 32-page adventure, or once per chapter in a major hardcover adventure.

Multiclass characters can roll on any chart for which they have levels. If you are a multiclass paladin/cleric, for instance, you can roll on either the paladin or cleric chart. You make this decision each time you roll.

## Who Rolls?

This book assumes the player rolls on their own chart. The problem with this, of course, is that the results are random. There may be some results that you know the player wouldn't like, or that you think are a bad fit for your campaign or the current adventure. In this case, you have a couple options.

### Make a Unique Chart

There are enough examples here that if you wanted to, say, cut the idea of units entirely, you could just fill in the gap by adding some more followers or expanding some of the ranges on the roll results. If you know some results will be problematic in your world or for your players, you can just cut them, replace them, and/or adjust the numbers.

Ultimately, you could even create an entirely custom chart for a given player. This can be a lot of fun, and hopefully there are enough examples here that you'll feel like you could do this pretty easily if you wanted to.

### The GM Rolls

This option solves a lot of problems because you can roll behind the screen and just choose a follower for the player, ignoring the roll. This is called lying. Don't make that face—all of the game is a fiction, and your job as a GM is to curate the experience of it using the rules as a lingua franca between you and the players.

Like all such choices, including the choice of what adventure to run, or which monsters to use, or how a given NPC will react, this option gives you the power to curate the experience and pick something you know both the player will like and won't unbalance your game or make your life hard. And if the player believes the die roll was real, all the better.

Of course, the player has to be okay with this. If they feel like it's their roll, then taking it away removes some of their belief in the result, and belief is all we have in this business of GMing. You really need to know your players to make this work.

### No Rolls, You Just Pick

I have done this, it can work, it just depends on your player and knowing what the juice is for them. If the juice—the reason they built a stronghold—is that they want to roll on the chart and see the result and know (or believe, which is just as good for our purposes) that this is the real result, then they need to roll on the chart.

But if it seems like they're not really interested in actually rolling, only in the result, then you can just pick something for them. "As work finishes on your tower, you see an elf standing at the edge of the clearing, watching..." That elf is their new follower! No roll needed!

## The Barbarian's Camp

The barbarian's camp promises good food and drink as well as contests of strength and bravery, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Ale within the barbarian's demesne is particularly refreshing, bringing good cheer with no hangovers the next day no matter how much is consumed.  
- Wildlife within the barbarian's demesne grows especially large and fierce, migrating as the camp moves.  
- Poisons brought into the barbarian's demesne neutralize within the hour. No such cowardly "civilized" forms of death are permitted.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the barbarian takes a stronghold action with one of the following effects. They must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold and cannot use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- You issue forth a mighty "Yawp!" that causes all enemies within 60 feet to become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- You rage, and your allies gain the benefits of your rage as long as those allies aren't wearing heavy armor.  
- You cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chain Lightning.md\|chain lightning]] ^[That's right. Even though Barbarians can't cast spells, nature comes to their aid in their stronghold.] with a DC equal to 8 plus your proficiency modifier, plus your Constitution modifier. You may do this even while raging, and this does not end your rage.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Chieftain's Rage

Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to make a second attack or take a free movement. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

### A Barbarian's Followers

Barbarians prefer followers who are independent and don't require a lot of oversight. They don't classically attract a large retinue, they don't usually build great keeps to house their staff and servants. A barbarian's follower must be at home in wild places, willing and able to relocate quickly and live by their wits.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Barbarian Followers (SAF).md\|Barbarian Followers]]

Their followers tend to be martial and savage. Barbarians can attract units, but they tend to be light and Barbarians don't go in much for leading large armies. Big armies require a lot of organization and discipline neither of which barbarians' classically value overmuch.

Barbarian retainers tend to be followers at home with nature, savagery, and chaos. Barbarians look skeptically upon knights, but welcome those who make pacts with dark forces or serve the tempest of nature. Few artisans are eager to live amongst a barbarian camp, mostly blacksmiths and miners, but barbarians tend to go places and do things other regents would never dream of, making life as a barbarian's servant an attractive prospect for sage.

The ambassadors they attract tend to represent nearby humanoid tribes who do not automatically see a barbarian tribe as an enemy, just because they are led by a human or elf or dwarf. To the local gnolls or hobgoblins, a barbarian camp is just another local tribe, and could make a powerful ally.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/bard-theatre.webp#center)

## The Bard's Theater

The bard's theater promises drama and entertainment! Poetry and song. But also rumor and intrigue! It creates one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Whenever the wind blows through the trees in the bard's demesne, music plays. Hooves on roads beat out a complex rhythm.  
- Folks who live for a week in the bard's demesne find themselves ending conversations with rhyming couplets.  
- Thunder can be counted on to roll whenever someone in the bard's demesne says something dramatic. Ravens obediently alight on nearby branches when it is dramatically expected of them.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the bard takes a stronghold action with one of the following effects. The bard must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold and cannot use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, all inspiration dice produce their maximum result when rolled, followed by the sounding of a two-note chord: one root note and another a fifth higher than the root.  
- A three-piece band arrives singing your praises. Until initiative count 20 on the next turn, enemies make saving throws against your magic by rolling three `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`)s and using the worst of the three. The band has exceptionally good rhythm and world-class lute fingering, and the singer has an unusually high voice.  
- You regain all inspiration dice.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Encouraging Inspiration

While an ally has unspent inspiration their proficiency bonus increases by +1. This applies to a number of inspiration dice equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/cleric-church.webp#center)

## The Cleric's Church

The cleric's church is a bastion of faith for believers and adherents to their deity's laws, and a symbol of resistance against those forces that oppose the cleric's god, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Folks who live in the cleric's demesne are immune to disease.  
- The cleric can hear the prayers of those living in their demesne who are in concordance with the cleric's deity.  
- While the cleric is hale, the weather in their demesne is fair. If the cleric is wounded or suffering, the weather turns foul. For this effect to happen, the cleric merely has to be on the same plane as their demesne.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the cleric takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The cleric must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold, and can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- All enemies within 30 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contagion.md\|contagion]] spell.  
- Shafts of golden light stab down from the sky, penetrating walls and ceilings. The beams target all undead, demons, and devils within 60 feet of you, even those hidden or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]]. Targets must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be annihilated.  
- You and all allies in the stronghold recover all Hit Dice and gain 30 temporary hit points.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Manifest Divinity

When using your Channel Divinity class feature, all allies within 30 feet regain `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) hit points. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/druid-grove.webp#center)

## The Druid's Grove

The druid's grove ^[This is a notional, narrative term. It doesn't necessarily mean you're using the alternate temple rules for a druid's grove.] is a symbol of nature's beauty and power, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Local birds and mammals in the druid's demesne can speak Common and Elvish. They enjoy talking to new people but will try to find and warn the druid if suspicious strangers enter the demesne.  
- Nuts, fruits, and vegetables grown naturally (i.e., not farmed or cultivated) in the druid's demesne grant those who eat them the effect of [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Goodberry.md\|goodberry]]. If taken outside the demesne, they lose this effect.  
- No roads or trails in the druid's demesne last more than a day. However, allies and the units of allies can pass through the demesne as though there were roads.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the druid takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The druid must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold, and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- Grasping vines rise from the ground for 1 minute. Every enemy within 60 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] for the duration, taking `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) damage at the start of each of their rounds from stabbing thorns. At the end of its turn, an affected enemy can make another saving throw to escape.  
- You cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Banishment.md\|banishment]] on an enemy, sending them to Arcadia on a failed save.  
- You summon `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4+1`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Shambling Mound.md\|shambling mounds]] who fight for you for 1 minute.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Savage Shape

When you assume your Wild Shape, you may assume the form of any monstrosity, fey, or dragon, including those with a flying or swimming speed. You may use this ability to transform into a creature with a Challenge Rating up to half your level, rounded up. All other Wild Shape restrictions and benefits apply (including using all of the form's actions and abilities except lair and legendary actions). You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Druid Followers (SAF).md\|Druid Followers]]

### A Druid's Followers

Living between civilization and wilderness, the druid attracts followers willing to put up with a life devoted to the health and well-being of nature, defending it and learning its secrets. Few are willing to walk this path but those who do are totally devoted to the druid's service.

Druids care little for the command and upkeep of large armies, preferring to use battle magic to raise special units when necessary. This being said, they are one of the classes that can attract flying units, often hawkriders or units mounted on giant owls.

Few artisans are interested in a life lived outside civilization, but druids are spellcasters and loremasters so it's natural for alchemists, sages, and scribes to pledge service in exchange for greater knowledge.

Ambassadors who wish to join a druid's retinue are usually fey, or aligned with them, or creatures who prefer the swamps and bogs that druids are naturally attracted to as sources of power. And druids have their own short list of special allies they may recruit from among the fey creatures of the wood.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/fighter-fortress.webp#center)

## The Fighter's Fortress

The fighter's fortress is a bastion against intruders, and it rewards those who practice their martial training, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Fortifications in the fighter's demesne grant units defending them an extra +2 Morale bonus.  
- Menhirs appear in the fighter's demesne, following anyone hostile to those who call this province home, imposing themselves between intruders and the locals.  
- Archers who train in the fighter's demesne find their arrows go farther and strike more accurately.  
- Edged weapons in the fighter's demesne are keener and do not dull.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the fighter takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The fighter must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold, and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, any enemy who tries to cast a spell in your demesne experiences searing pain. The enemy can choose another action, but if it chooses to cast the spell, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) force damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted.  
- Until the end of your next turn, you and all your allies' weapon attacks hit automatically. Roll anyway, though—you might score a crit!  
- You and all your allies are restored to full hit points.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Fighting Surge

Whenever you attack by using your Action Surge, you automatically score a critical hit. You can do this for a number of surges equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Fighter Followers (SAF).md\|Fighter Followers]]

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/monk-monastery.webp#center)

## The Monk's Monastery

The monk's monastery is a monument to contemplation and self-reliance, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Creatures age more slowly within the confines of the monk's demesne.  
- The temperature in the monk's demesne is always temperate, all year round, all day long.  
- Violence of any kind in the demesne has a 15% chance of summoning a Source of Earth, who immediately uses Back to Earth to end the violence. The monk can reverse these effects.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the monk takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The monk must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold, and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, your skin becomes diamond. For the duration, you are immune to all but psychic damage.  
- You make eight unarmed attacks against an adjacent enemy.  
- You regain all ki, as though you had finished a long rest.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Focused Ki

Whenever you are attacked while you have unspent ki, you can ignore all of its effects except its damage. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

> The Scion of Orcus casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Evards Black Tentacles.md\|black tentacles]], and Bhaltair the monk is in the area of effect. Regardless of the outcome of Bhaltair's Evasion, he is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the tentacles because he has unspent ki.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Monk Followers (SAF).md\|Monk Followers]]

## The Paladin's Chapel

The paladin's chapel broadcasts the power of good and law across the countryside, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Clear blue skies and warm sun dominate yearround. Rain falls only at night, and thunderstorms avoid the area.  
- Evil creatures in daylight have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.  
- The paladin is instantly aware of the presence and location in his demesne of any chaotic or evil creature with more than 7 Hit Dice. The range of this awareness is a number of hexes equal to the level of the paladin's stronghold.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the paladin takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The paladin must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- Each chaotic or evil creature (your choice) within 120 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be bound by gold (anti-evil) or silver (anti-chaos) chains, grappling it until it makes a Strength or Dexterity check as an action against your spell DC.  
- Flying creatures within 120 feet must succeed on a Constitution check or immediately land. They cannot take off again for the remainder of combat.  
- Choose an ally within sight to gain an AC bonus equal to your Charisma bonus, as their armor becomes gold, for the remainder of combat. Each ally can be affected by this ability only once per day.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Righteous Smite

Your Divine Smite burns through enemy resistance. Enemies normally resistant to either radiant damage or your weapon damage lose it. Enemies invulnerable to either type of damage are now resistant to it, and enemies without resistance to either divine or weapon damage become vulnerable.

You can do this for a number of attacks equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Paladin Followers (SAF).md\|Paladin Followers]]

### Winged Elves

A paladin might attract an ambassador from the Covert Court, the court of the winged elves. This allows the paladin to buy Aerial units with winged elf ancestry (see Creating Your Own Units on page 235).

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Special Paladin Mount (SAF).md\|Special Paladin Mount]]

### A Paladin's Mount

If you roll really well (91-93), you get a special paladin mount as a follower! This mount replaces the normal horse that you can attract. And, of course, if you roll even higher (94-100) you may attract a dragon. If your dragon is incredibly good-natured and well-disposed to you, it may let you ride it, but this is rare, for dragons are proud creatures. That being said, in times of desperation, your allies may come to your aid in combat—especially when defending your realm—and in these times legends tell of great paladins who rode their dragon allies into battle. Probably the dragon versions of these stories tell a different tale.

### Alicorn

Natives of Arcadia, the winged unicorn (not to be confused with the horned pegasus) can be summoned by a particularly devout paladin to serve as their mount. They do not particularly like the Mundane World, but they enjoy and find satisfaction in hunting evil and chaos. They will serve as mount and companion to a holy knight only so long as it brings the opportunity to smash evil, a sport they are denied on their home plane.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/ranger-lodge.webp#center)

## The Ranger's Lodge

The ranger's lodge is a place of good hunting and security, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Stags, harts, and other game are always plentiful in the ranger's demesne, but they are larger and fiercer than normal.  
- Enemies of the ranger and the locals must make DC 15 [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]] checks to navigate the ranger's demesne. On a failure, they are attacked by `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) winter wolves.  
- Allies treat the ranger's demesne as favored terrain when moving their units. Enemy units treat it as difficult terrain.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the ranger takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The ranger must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- Small targets appear on the vulnerable spots of nearby enemies. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, all enemies within 60 feet have vulnerability to your attacks.  
- You summon a fog cloud in a 60-foot radius that lasts for 1 minute. You and your allies can see through this fog as though it were merely a hazy mist that did not obscure vision.  
- Until initiative count 20 on the next turn, all of your successful attacks also cause the target to bleed. A bleeding creature takes `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) damage at the start of each of its following turns, and can make a DC 18 Constitution save at the end of each of its turns to end the bleeding.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Chosen Enemy

Your favored enemy has vulnerability to your attacks ^[Remember, the goal is players read this and think, "Wow I want to build a stronghold." And the GM sees "Oh this only happens like three times per adventure" and doesn't freak out.]. You can do this to a number of damage rolls equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Ranger Followers (SAF).md\|Ranger Followers]]

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/rogue-tavern.webp#center)

## The Rogue's Tavern

The rogue's tavern is a hotbed of intrigue and information, creating one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion. These rules assume a 24-mile hex, so all powers affect a 12-mile radius.

### Demesne Effects

- One ally per level of the rogue's stronghold can hide in the rogue's demesne, and no mundane or magical means will reveal their location. This ability does not work on the owner of the stronghold.  
- Creatures trespassing in the rogue's demesne have the overwhelming sensation they are being spied upon.  
- When a creature hostile to the rogue and aware of their existence finishes a long rest within the rogue's demesne, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a roll of 10 or less, the creature triggers a hidden trap, taking `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) piercing damage.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the rogue takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The rogue must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- All enemies within 60 feet are marked for death. For the next minute, if you hit a marked enemy, you can remove its mark to deal an extra `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) slashing damage.  
- Enemies within 60 feet are revealed, losing stealth and invisibility.  
- You gain a Coin of Fate. Each time you are hit in combat, you may flip the coin. Heads, the attack misses instead. Tails, the attack hits as normal and you lose the coin.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Vanishing Strike

After you hit with a Sneak Attack, you may become invisible. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on your person. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

![[5. Mechanics/Tables/Rogue Followers (SAF).md\|Rogue Followers]]

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/sorcerer-sanctum.webp#center)

## The Sorcerer's Sanctum

The sorcerer's sanctum houses a collection of curious and antiquities. It creates one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- Curses, blessings, and oaths pronounced within the sorcerer's demesne have a 15% chance of causing the speaker to roll on the Wild Magic table.  
- Folks who live in the sorcerer's demesne for a season learn one random sorcerer cantrip. They lose the ability to cast it if they ever leave.  
- Raindrops in the sorcerer's demesne cast dazzling prismatic reflections during the day.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sorcerer takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The sorcerer must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- You cast three spells from your list of prepared spells, using spell slots as normal.  
- For the next minute, all of your spells are heightened, as per [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Heightened Spell.md\|heightened spell]]. You cannot use sorcery points to heighten an already heightened spell.  
- You are wreathed by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fire Shield.md\|fire shield]]. Enemies who strike the shield take `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) damage instead of `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).

### A Sorcerer's Followers

Average folks find wizards weird enough, gabbling in strange languages and living up to their eyeballs in books and owl poop. But they, at least, have rules. A sorcerer, on the other hand, gains their power through an innate connection with the forces of magic. No training required. This is even less well understood by normal people. A sorcerer's followers therefore tend to be folks who enjoy being close to raw power and do not fear what they do not understand.

A sorcerer's army is usually light and highly mobile and like other classes that eschew large, slow, heavily armed and armored soldiers, they can attract flying units. Their retainers are almost all spellcasters. Their artisans are folks who enjoy making things and probably hope being in the court of a sorcerer will grant them the opportunity to create magic items. Their ambassadors come from cultures that do not fear sorcery and whose soldiers would have no problem serving under a commander who can conjure fire through sheer will.

## The Warlock's Fane

The warlock's fane is a locus of power committed to a being of alien intelligence. It creates one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- The sun appears as a baleful orb in the sky over the warlock's demesne.  
- In the warlock's demesne, constellations in the night sky are strange, and stars occasionally fall from the sky.  
- The warlock is immediately aware of enemies in their demesne.  
- Once per month, the warlock can summon an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Earthquake.md\|earthquake]], as per the spell, targeting any enemies in their demesne.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the warlock takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The warlock must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold, and can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- You recover all spell slots as though you completed a short rest.  
- You fire an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Eldritch Blast.md\|eldritch blast]] at each enemy you can see within 60 feet.  
- You summon a Type VI servitor (page 31).  

### Class Feature Improvement: Master Invoker

You gain an extra spell slot. You may use this extra spell slot a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

## The Wizard's Library

The wizard's library is a bastion of knowledge and research best hidden from the mundane world. It creates one or more of the following effects at the GM's discretion.

### Demesne Effects

- The library of the wizard's stronghold has a copy of every nonmagical book anyone brings into the wizard's demesne.  
- By concentrating for 10 minutes, the wizard can scry on any person or location in their demesne as per the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] spell. The wizard can do this while anywhere, including another world.  
- Once per day, the wizard can control the weather in their demesne. The wizard doesn't have to be in their demesne to do this. The effect is otherwise the same as the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Control Weather.md\|control weather]] spell.  

### Stronghold Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the wizard takes a stronghold action to cause one of the following effects. The wizard must be in the same hex or province as their stronghold, and can't use the same effect again until after a short rest.

- You cast a spell from your list of prepared spells. This does not use a spell slot.  
- You cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Flesh To Stone.md\|flesh to stone]] on all enemies within 60 feet. This does not use a spell slot.  
- You recover all spent spell slots as though you had finished a long rest.  

### Class Feature Improvement: Spellmaster

You can maintain two spells with concentration at once. You can do this a number of times equal to your stronghold level, after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.

## Villain Strongholds

The villains of your campaign can—and if your players are using these rules, probably should—have their own stronghold, which grants them villain abilities which will help them threaten PCs with strongholds. GMs, you are encouraged to play fast and loose with what counts as a stronghold for these purposes. Probably the best answer for this is "wherever the bad guy keeps their treasure."

They also grant the villain's minions ^[This book assumes a "minion" is any flunky working for a villain. It doesn't necessarily mean "a 1 hp enemy" from the 4E rules, although I am a big fan of that rule.] special abilities under the premise that everyone trains harder and fights better when they have a cool base.

### Types of Villains and Minions

We could get very noodly indeed here with many kinds and types of villains and minions, but I want to keep it simple, so we go by the **Rule of Three**. Villains fall into three broad categories—necromancer, shaman, warlord—and minions fall into mindless servants, rampaging hordes, and tactical phalanxes. This covers a lot of ground, but obviously it doesn't cover everything, so feel free to adjust these terms and abilities to fit your adventure.

Although it may seem obvious that a necromancer would command mindless servants, it need not be so. The abilities of the villains and minions aren't designed to synergize in any particular way. A Necromancer may command a Savage Horde, or a Shaman command Mindless Servants. All the abilities will be useful, without any combination turning the encounter into a rout. At least, not on purpose!

**Minions require a leader**, though that leader need not be present on the battlefield. Like the heroes' stronghold abilities, these villain and minion powers are granted through training and a connection with the land itself. If the party finds itself fighting a band of goblins who seem to be critting more often, it's a sign that they come from a nearby goblin stronghold and serve some villainous leader! Probably a hobgoblin.

This is a dramatic way to introduce a villain and hint to the players that there must be a nearby enemy stronghold! The players fight undead or goblinoids or cultists, or bandits and they seem much more...capable than the normal beasties they're used to fighting. When these enemies charge into battle, they call out something that sounds like it might be a name? Maybe capturing one would be a good idea. Question it. Oops, it didn't survive long enough to spill the beans. Well, all will become clear once the heroes penetrate the enemy stronghold and fight the leader of these creatures.

### Villain Examples

#### Necromancer

*Lady Sariel the Vampire Queen, Cult Leader*

**Special Ability:** As a reaction make a Wisdom check after a minion takes enough damage to kill it. The DC is 8 plus the Hit Dice of the minion. If successful, the minion does not die and drops to 1 hit point.

#### Shaman

*Lizardfolk chieftain, Troll Shaman*

**Special Ability:** Minions who can hear you gain advantage on saving throws against magical spells and effects.

#### Warlord

*Bonebreaker Dorokor, Bandit king*

**Special Ability:** As a reaction, when a minion dies, issue a command to your other minions. Those who can hear you gain a reaction they can use to immediately move again.

### Minion Examples

#### Mindless Servants

*Undead, Oozes, Constructs*

**Special Ability:** Gain an extra 10 feet of movement.

#### Savage Horde

*Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Thugs*

**Special Ability:** After moving at least 20 feet, the next attack this minion makes is a critical hit on an 18-20.

#### Tactical Phanlanx

*Hobgoblins, Lizardfolk, Devils, Cultists, Bandits*

**Special Ability:** If an enemy's attack kills an ally, all minions adjacent to that enemy gain an attack of opportunity against the enemy.

## Special Allies

Congratulations! You rolled well on your follower chart and attracted a special ally! Allies are like followers in that they approve of what you're doing in the world and want to help, but allies are powerful beings, often more powerful than your character. They cannot be ordered around, and they can be unreliable. Find your alignment on the chart below and roll a `dice:d12|noform|avg` (`d12`) to see which cool beastie shows up to help you out.
