# New Items
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

## Installation

Some items must be **installed** in your stronghold in order to function. Such items cease to function if taken from the stronghold in which they were installed, and must be reinstalled to regain their power, though their powers may still work on *you* if you leave.

## Codices

There was a time in the earliest Ages of Man when magic was new, and wild, and understanding it shaped it, constrained it. And thereby constrained the world.

The greatest sages wrote their understanding of magic, of fire and shadow, of machines and time and the universe itself into their great works, the codices. Each codex is a powerful magical tome, an artifact unto itself, and unlocking its knowledge instantly makes you one of the most powerful people in the world.

No sage is known to have written more than one, and each author was in their lifetime famous as one of the greatest practitioners of magic in all Orden. Each codex requires attunement and thus no wizard could benefit from more than three at once, but even that would be a historical first. These books contain so much power that they have a personality of their own and do not like being in close proximity (say, 500 miles) of another codex.

They aren't items you can run around and collect, and no one knows how many there might be. References in the Library of the Royal College suggest there could be as many as a hundred such tomes, but that list was compiled from unverified and in some cases outright unreliable sources.

Attempting to copy a codex produces a book with all the words in the right order, but no magic and no effects.

### Codices in Your Campaign

A codex grants its owner remarkable powers beyond the scope of even most artifacts. No rules could cover every possible consequence of their effects, and as the GM, you should only deploy them if you feel inspired. If you read this and think, "That's amazing, I'm going to try it!" be aware that a codex may permanently change your setting and place you in a sticky situation where you have to invent some strange and unexpected consequences for the PC who deploys its powers. And if that sounds awesome, then you've come to the right place.

If, on the other hand, you read this and think, "I have no idea how that would work," and your head is filled with nightmare scenarios where your entire campaign collapses like a flan in a cupboard, then maybe these books should live as rumors.

Alternatively, it's very easy to award one of these books to your players and just tell them some of the book's secrets are indecipherable. Limit the power of the book to make it a cool reward, but not one that grants omnipotence.

That said, I have never used a codex as a rewardâ€”I've only ever deployed them as part of a larger problem. My campaigns assumed the codices should be kept secure in the hands of responsible, powerful NPCs and that, when they are stolen or they disappear under mysterious circumstances, the PCs will be deployed to recover them and return them.

Thus, the players typically get to enjoy the power of a codex for a little while, but not in a manner that permanently unbalances the game.

Reading the descriptions of these ancient tomes these should spark ideas for an adventure where someone, a villain or a well-meaning but misguided sage, has unlocked the power of a codex and must now be stopped!

### Attuning to a Codex

All the codices require attunement, which requires the reader to spend a month in uninterrupted study of no less than 8 hours per day and 48 hours, six days per week.

Once attuned, the owner of the codex need not take the book with them. They can leave it in a secure location and still gain its benefits, but must refresh their knowledge through 8 hours of uninterrupted study once per month or else lose its benefits.

### Sacrifice

Some of these books require the attuned owner to surrender some of their life essence to satiate the dark powers constrained or described in their texts. Sacrificing requires rolling some number of Hit Dice, losing that many hit points *and* the Hit Dice immediately, and reducing your maximum hit points by the same amount. While the effect powered by the sacrifice persists, the lost hit points and Hit Dice cannot be regenerated. When the effect ends, you can heal the damage and recover the Hit Dice normally.

If sacrificing Hit Dice causes you to drop to 0 hit points, you fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious\|unconscious]] and all effects you created end. You cannot sacrifice more Hit Dice than you have. If you must sacrifice a Hit Die to power an effect but you have none, the effect ends.
