## Amphibios/Laterreprosp

Amphibios is a swampy, low-lying valley covering approximately 100,000 acres (156 square miles) of territory between two small, human-dominant kingdoms. Most of Amphibios' settlements consist of minority amphibious and reptilian races such as frogfolk, kobold, lizardfolk, serpentfolk, and toadfolk. Although humans call the land Amphibios, its residents know it as Laterreprosp.

### History

Laterreprosp's history started long before the human kingdoms claimed the lands to the south and north. Thousands of years ago, a trio of three green dragon brothers settled the area between Vasteloc and Lake Lebonke, the two significant bodies of water that comprise most of the region. Each dragon built and managed its stronghold, dividing the land into three sections.

Entixiir, the strongest of the three brothers, built his lair on the northern shores of The Murk. From this site rose the frog and toadfolk city of Oudaarde, which is still the largest settlement in Laterreprosp today.

Joshtinovivesh, the most charismatic of the three, built his lair just east of The Murk in a muddy hollow called Dragontooth Burrows. Dragontooth Burrows still exists today and is inhabited by Joshinovivesh's greedy, diabolical grandson, Acridaethruix.

Dralzos, the wisest of the three, built his lair in the foothills of the valley's western edger, an area now known as the Chatsdown Slopes. Dralzos terrorized the region from this lair, which he named the Labyrinth of Skulls, for a few hundred years before a band of adventurers entered the Labyrinth and slew him. Today, brutish cliff giants claim the Labyrinth as their own.

As the three dragons' hoards grew and lairs expanded, they used sorcery to develop servitor races. They used the local wildlife, particularly the reptiles and frogs common in the area. Entinxiir transformed the frogs and toads at the north end of Laterreprosp into roobles (frogfolk) and ruglunks (toadfolk) (see the appendix). And Joshtinovivesh created rangols (see the appendix), an almost alchemical hybrid of kobolds, toads, and frogs capable of withstanding sunlight. Roobles, ruglunks, and rangols are collectively referred to as ruun (pronounced the same as "rune"). Dralzos attracted traditional kobolds and serpentfolk to his mysterious lair, modifying them only slightly to withstand his poisonous exhalations.

Eventually, Dralzos died, scattering the loyal serpentfolk and kobolds who served him. Few traditional kobolds and serpentfolk remain in Laterreprosp and typically survive meagerly as mad cultists or hermetic druids that still worship Dralzos as a god.

Entixiir grew bored of overseeing a kingdom and fled, seeking new interests. He left the roobles and ruglunks to fend for themselves. In the absence of their tyrant, the roobles and ruglunks built Oudaarde into a grand city.

But for every rooble or ruglunk are three rangols, who remain primarily in The Murk in eastern Laterreprosp. The rangols are almost universally devout followers of Joshtinovivesh and, by extension, his grandson Acridaethruix. As a result, the rangols are more than happy to help carry out the final green dragon's ambitions of claiming all of Laterreprosp as his own.

### Current Events

When Dralvos died and Entixiir fled Amphibios, Joshtinovivesh wisely laid low for hundreds of years. The dragon feared adventurers would seek him in his burrow, slay him, and steal his hard-earned treasure, much like they had to Dralvos. He used his rangols to create false haunts all over the realm to distract and annoy would-be heroes. In time, history forgot Joshtinovivesh; the dragon died fat and forgotten. Joshtinovivesh had six children, each with their own lairs and holdings in other parts of the land. Those who survived to adulthood had spawn of their own. And from one of those nests came the dragon Acridaethruix, one of the nastiest, serpentlike dragons ever to set foot in the land. Curious about his ancestry, Acridaethruix sought his grandfather's domain, a quest that took the dragon over 50 years. Eventually, Acridaethruix discovered Dragontooth Burrow, his grandfather's withered corpse, and the massive treasure lode hidden within. Acridaethruix also discovered the rangols, who, despite being dozens of generations removed from Joshtinovivesh's rule, immediately recognized their new master.

With newfound wealth and power, Acridaethruix set his sights on Laterreprosp other ancient dragon kingdoms, those belonging to his great uncles. However, in the time since Entixiir left Amphibios, Entixiir's minions, the roobles and ruglunks, became a power unto themselves. The roobles and ruglunks of Oudaarde used forgotten tomes hidden in Entinixiir's abandoned libraries as a guideline for humanoid society. They developed agriculture, currency, government, technology, and trade. Today, they practice a form of feudalism, where a Royal Court claims Laterreprosp as its domain. As soon as Acridaethruix set his minions out to claim Amphibios, he found his efforts swiftly repelled by the well-organized Ourdaardians. The conflict continues between the dragon and the Ourdaardians, evolving from simple martial engagements into battles of intrigue and politics which those in the know nicknamed "Croaks and Hisses."

### Oudaarde

Oudaarde (YOO-dard) is the largest settlement in Amphibios. This small city began as a colony of roobles and ruglunks serving the green dragon Entixiir. When Entixiir fled, its people used the dragon's old libraries to educate themselves on the ways of the greater world. The people of Oudaarde adopted the feudalistic ways of the older kingdoms, believing that it was the best way forward for their people.

Reflecting the amphibious nature of its citizens, Oudaarde is just as much as a town below water as it is above water. Curved canals crisscross throughout the city, connecting the upper city's most important buildings. Tall, foundational pillars extend from the bottom of Lake Lebonke up to the surface, allowing structures to be built above and below the waterline using them as a base. The Oudaardians offer ways for non-swimmers to move throughout the upper city. Long gondolas woven from swamp reeds slip through the waterways with ease while ferries built upon the backs of the city's giant geese travel along the lake's banks, their warning honks heard for miles around.

Many of Ourdaarde's vital structures hide partially or entirely below Lake Lebonke, using their submersion to protect them from non-swimming invaders. The bottom of the city's Royal Palace, home of the Queen and her son, looks like a cluster of shimmering bubbles beneath the water's surface. The palace rises from the bottom of the lakebed to extend high above the water's surface, creating a central structure at the city's center. Many structures hidden by or within the palace, typically along the lakebed, were once part of the green dragon Entixiir's lair.

#### Oudaarde Basics

- **Population.** 9,700 (47% [[5. Mechanics/Races/Ruun Rooble (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|roobles]], 43% [[5. Mechanics/Races/Ruun Ruglunk (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|ruglunks]], 5% [[5. Mechanics/Races/Human.md\|human]], 3% [[5. Mechanics/Races/Ruun Rangol (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|rangol]] defectors or refugees, 2% other)  
- **Leader.** The Royal Family of Oudaarde, Warrior Queen Anya Wingwumm, and her son (roobles). Queen Wingwumm remains unwed and does not actively seek suitors. The Amphibious Court aids them.  
- **Militia.** 500 full-time soldiers (basic ruuns) led by 50 knights; the city can muster an additional 1500 ruun militia members (tribal warriors) led by 15 rooble veterans. A band of 50 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]] patrol the waters and forests outside of the city, keeping it safe from the murkfolk.  
- **Commerce.** Oudaarde specializes in the food trade, particularly in rice, sugar cane, tomatoes, and cranberries. They also trade reed, clay, and stone quarried from the Chatsdown Slopes. They import steel, gems, and precious metals from their human neighbors.  
- **Rivalries.** Oudaarde's most significant rivalry is with its sister city, Belciennes: a smaller city of 4,000 roobles and ruglunks located on Lake Vasteloc the north. They believe that the legacy of Sir Varion, a legendary human knight originally from Belciennes that moved to Oudaarde, is theirs to own and maintain, and not Oudaarde's. Although Oudaarde participates in intrigue and politics outside of their Croaks and Hisses, they rarely stoke rivalries with outsiders.  

#### Overland Travel

While Amphibios does have its fair share of paved aquatic highways and well-tread roads, flooding and frequent skirmishes sometimes make travel problematic. Travel times in the Overland Travel from Oudaarde table assume that characters are on foot; mounts can shorten these times by 50 percent.

**Overland Travel from Oudaarde**

| Travel to | Travel from |
|-----------|-------------|
| Belciennes | 3 hours |
| Drappes | 1 hour |
| Longstone | 2 hours |
| Soives | 1 hour |
| WÃ¤densstein | 3 hours |

#### Important Ourdaardians

The list of important Ourdaardians listed below represents the most critical individuals who live in the city and those the characters will likely encounter while searching for quests and other things to do.

- **Warrior Queen Anya Wingwumm.** is Oudaarde's rooble monarch. She is headstrong and lacks decorum. For this reason, many younger Oudaardians love her, while the older, more conservative Oudaardian nobles find her meddlesome.  

- **Prince Alec Wingwumm.** is Queen Wingwumm's son. He has no interest in ruling and instead hopes to continue in his mother's martial footsteps as Knight Prince. He works closely with Marie-JosÃ© Bullion in leading Oudaarde's knights and military.  

- **Duke Tristan Lafaille.** is a ruglunk in his fifties. He is also Oudaarde's wealthiest noble and Queen Wingwumm's most outspoken critic. Lafaille hopes to remove Wingwumm from her position and install her young son, who he believes he can control.  

- **Sir Gilles Longchambon.** is the Wingwumm's silent, onearmed rangol bodyguard. He is unflappable in his loyalty to the family and will give his life to protect them.  

- **GÃ©rard Chopin.** is the rooble leader of Entixiir's Chosen, an evil-leaning faction that believes the people of Oudaarde should revert to their original purpose and serve green dragons.  

- **Marie-JosÃ© Bullion.** heads the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]], a group of rangers that patrols the lands and waters surrounding Oudaarde. Many Oudaardians view her as Ourdaarde's most significant living hero.  

- **RÃ©gis Rapace.** is the high priest of the Ebonhands, a necromantic cult that worships Dhennia, the Ebon God of Death: the same god worshiped by Entixiir. Despite their bleak outlook, the Ebonhands fulfill a valuable role in the city, maintaining its above-ground tombs.  

- **Cyrille Sartre.** captains the Relics of the Fortunate, a music-loving adventuring guild that explores the labyrinthine tunnels below the city and the draconic treasure hidden throughout Amphibios. The Relics believe that the city's tunnels were created by creatures who existed even before Entixxiir. Many of the things they find they keep in their guild house, Cyrille's Curio of Cursed and Forbidden Relics.  

- **Oggle.** is a bizarre, three-eye ruglunk known for his skill in illusion magic. He leads the Rotten, a sect of Oudaarde's lower caste who openly challenges the monarchy. Oggle believes the rule of Oudaarde and Laterreprosp should be in the hands of the people and not Queen Wingwumm or any other form of monarchy.  

#### Adventure In Oudaarde

Oudaarde is the largest and most prosperous settlement in Amphibios, so it only makes sense that the characters might use it as their base of operations. While in the city, they will find various opportunities for adventure. Below are three adventure hooks to get you started. Review the section Amphibios Sites for additional adventure hooks.

##### Alec's Lost Token

Last week, Warrior Queen Anya Wingwumm left the palace at Ourdaarde on a missionâshe wants to recover the locket she gave to the late Sir Alec Varion, a human knight of great renown, before his death. While she hunts for leads across Amphibios, she uses a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hat Of Disguise.md\|hat of disguise]] to mask her appearance.

With only the last leg of her journey before her, she offers the characters a sizable reward to help her recover this token of her affection. She knows where it's likely being held but wants the excursion to recover it to be kept secret.

##### Sir Varion's Relics

Shortly after Sir Alec Varion's death, a gang of fanatical frogres (rooble **ogres**) stole relics from the knight's tomb.

The items were his helmet, lance, mantle, and shield. Before Belciennes warriors closed in on them, the frogres split the gear and went their separate ways. Recently, the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]] of Oudaarde reclaimed the mantle and imprisoned the frogre who stole it. After interrogating the frogre, the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]] discovered the locations of the other three pieces.

Now, they need the help of adventurers to recover the relics. Of course, this mission would be a lot easier if the nobles of Belciennes weren't intent on subverting the Oudaardians, claiming that the recovery mission is their responsibility and not Ourdaarde's.

##### Acridaethruix's Wrath

The rangols and frogres of The Murk rise again, led by the vile green dragon Acridaethruix. There seems to be no end to their numbers as the dragon-worshipping creatures lay waste to hamlets and villages in Amphibios, including Oudaarde's neighboring village, Doives. The people of Oudaarde and Belciennes have temporarily put aside their differences to join forces against the dragon and its minions, but it's still not enough. The cry for adventurers travels far and wide, beyond Amphibios' borders. Who is brave enough to help?

#### Oudaarde Locations

Below are brief descriptions of important locations in Oudaarde. Many location descriptions feature additional adventure hooks to offer the characters while they are in Oudaarde.

##### Temple Of Dhennia

The ruuns of Oudaarde revere one god: Dhennia, the Ebon God of Death. Entixiir, the dragon who ruled Oudaarde centuries ago, worshipped the death god and believed it was his mission to create death. The modern Oudaardians view Dhennia differently, believing that living creatures should respect death, and that only the touch of Dhennia's black hand should be the one to bring it. The temple's priests are called Ebonhands. They perform last rites for the Oudaardians and maintain the city's above-ground tombs. Dhennia appears as an imposing rooble woman with dry, black skin in ruun representations of her, although Entixiir made no such depictions of her as such.

##### The Copper Pie Pub

The Copper Pie Pub gets its name from its famous copper pie. Despite decades of inflation, the cherished dish still costs only 1 cp. Of course, if you can escape the Copper Pie Pub without having a drink or two (or ten), you are a soul possessed of great willpower. Bright lights, catchy tunes, and charming rooble servers make the Copper Pie Pub a veritable gold trap. A yellow-striped rooble named Rodolphe Girardot owns and manages the pub.

##### Ye Olde Troll Tavern

No one in Oudaarde remembers where he came from or why he's thereâand why in the name of Dhennia he won't leaveâbut there's a troll that lives in Ye Olde Troll Tavern. Every evening, the eponymous old troll, who never shares his name, enters the tavern, crawls into the loft, and falls asleep, often with whatever farm animal it stole for the day. He leaves In the morning and isn't seen for at least 12 hours. The troll's exit signals the time when the tavern opens, and his return marks last call. As the saying goes, "Drink 'til the troll comes home."

Other than the troll who lives there, there isn't anything particularly remarkable about this above-ground tavern on the city's outskirts. The food and drink are so-so, and the four small rooms are good enough for a night's rest.

##### Royal Palace Of Oudaarde

The Royal Palace of Oudaarde, home of Warrior Queen Anya Wingwumm and her son, hides partially below the surface of Lake Lebonk. The impressive structure rises as a series of towers that serve as landmarks at the city's center, and extends completely down the bed of Lake Lebonke. Multiple, shimmering bubbles of force energy crafted by the long-dead runkle sorcerer, MystÃ©rieux, protect the palace's lower portions from forced entry or damage. Because much of the palace is underwater, non-water-breathers who hope to meet with the Queen or her entourage will need to find a way to swim and breathe while they visit. Not that it matters, of course. Bored by her position, the Queen is rarely home, intent to search Amphibios for relics once owned by her late lover, Sir Alec Varion. While she is away, her bodyguard, Sir Gilles Longchambon, watches over her son.

##### The Ancient Curtain

Most of Oudaarde's wealthy elite gather at The Ancient Curtain, an old mage tower at the city's center. Here, the old frogs and toads gather to discuss current events and play "Croaks and Hisses," the game of Oudaardian intrigue. Duke Tristan Lafaille is almost always found here, plotting and conspiring against his enemy, Queen Wingwumm. Although the Duke is profoundly paranoid, he's always eager to pay a fat coin sack to anyone with information that could potentially unseat the Queen.

##### Jolly Ship Wand Store

Originally a magic shop, the Jolly Ship Wand Store now serves as Oudaarde's all-purpose adventurer's shop. The shop consists of six lily pad structures tethered together by rope bridges. Each shop section offers a different variety of wares, with the centermost shop dedicated to magical goods.

Big Maude, a seven-foot-long awakened **giant toad** druid, manages the shop with her assistants, three awakened [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Wasp.md\|giant wasps]]. Anyone caught shoplifting in the shop usually ends up in Maude's mouth for an hour or two.

##### Cyrille's Curio Of Cursed And Forbidden Relics

This dilapidated, three-story shack hides amid an alley near the city's center. Gospel music pours from its windows and doors at almost all hours, the croaks of the Relics of the Fortunate, Oudaarde's resident adventurer's guild. Of course, the Relics snap silent when an "outsider" enters their cluttered shop. And unless the outsider can perform the 22-step secret handshake, the Relics quickly usher them back onto the lake. "Shop's closed!" they cry.

For this reason, most Oudaardians view the Relics as overzealous blowhards. Of course, the Relics enjoy this perception; in reality, the Relics of the Fortunate are the most successful treasure hunters in the land. Although their strange shop showcases a bounty of pretty, albeit useless, trinkets, their true treasure hoard hides within a magnificent mansion maintained by the Relic's cleverâand madâleader, Cyrille Sartre.

##### The Fire Spire

A strange geological phenomenon named The Fire Spire sits at the northwestern end of Oudaarde. Once at midday and again at night, The Fire Spire belches a flame jet 200-feet into the air above Oudaarde. No buildings surround The Fire Spire, only boiling mud. Far from any known volcano, the Oudaardian sages aren't sure what causes the spire to function, but assume it must be a leftover effect from the late sorcerer MystÃ©rieux. The Relics of the Forbidden's Cyrille Sartre believes it is somehow connected to the tunnels below the city, and possibly even a gateway to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

### Exploring Amphibios

When the characters first arrive in Oudaarde, they're likely to encounter various NPCs willing to point them in the direction of high adventure. While some of the quest hooks they discover may keep them in Oudaarde, others will send them out into the lands surrounding the city.

This section details travel around Amphibios and notable locations that the characters may wish to explore, including Dragontooth Burrows, the home of the wicked green dragon Acridaethruix.

#### Random Encounters

Most of Ampbhious is a wilderness filled with wildlife and terrifying monsters. Check for random encounters in the morning, afternoon, evening, and midnight. Roll 1d20; an encounter occurs on an 18 or higher. Roll 1d12 + 1d8 to determine what the adventurers encounter.

Place the encounter at a range that fits the scenario you want. You are free to decide whether or not the situation foreshadows the encounter, allowing the characters to avoid it altogether. The encounters listed below are balanced for parties of 3rd to 7th-level. On average, encounters that occur at night are much more difficult.

Encounters marked with an asterisk have explanations that appear after the table.

^day-night-encounter

Caravan. A caravan consists of merchants and his or her entourage heading for the nearest settlement. The group consists of 1d4 + 2 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Guard.md\|guards]], 2d4 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Commoner.md\|commoners]], and the caravan leader (a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Noble.md\|noble]]).

Homestead. The characters discover a homestead of rooble or ruglunk people, consisting of 1d6 adult [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Commoner.md\|commoners]] and 2d6 - 2 non-combatant children. Residents might provide friendly adventurers with food and shelter.

Human Bandits. A gang of human bandits gets the drop on the characters. The gang consists of 2d4 + 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit.md\|bandits]] led by a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit Captain.md\|bandit captain]].

Marshwardens. A band of 1d3 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]] stops the characters and questions their purpose in the area. The marshwardens aren't looking for a fight, but want to make sure tha the characters aren't spies working for the murkfolk.

Pilgrims. A group of pilgrims includes 2d6 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Commoner.md\|commoners]],

1d4 + 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Guard.md\|guards]], 1d4 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Acolyte.md\|acolytes]], and a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Priest.md\|priest]] bound for a holy or special site.

Rangol Scouts. The characters encounter a party of 1d4 + 2 rangol **scouts.** The scouts hide and observe and only engage if the party does first.

Rooble Hunters. This group includes a rooble [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Scout.md\|scout]] and 1d4 + 1 rooble and ruglunk [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Tribal Warrior.md\|tribal warriors]]. Roll a d6 to determine if they are friendly (1â3) or indifferent (4â6).

Rooble Loggers. This group includes 2d6 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Commoner.md\|commoners]] and 1d4 - 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Guard.md\|guards]]. The loggers use a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Giant Swamp Goose (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|giant swamp goose]] to help them transport logs to the nearest waters source.

### Amphibios Sites

This section details the unique locations and sites of interest the characters may encounter during their travels through Amphibios.

#### Belciennes

Belciennes is the second-largest settlement in Amphibios. Years ago, Belciennes's Duke and Duchess Varion were loyal subjects of the Wingwumms of Oudaarde. Then, tragedy struck. Sir Alec Varion of Belciennes, the duke's eldest son, died while trying to rescue Anya Wingwumm, who was then a princess. The Varions blame the Wingwumms for the death of their son, despite Anya's love for Alec, and have made every conceivable effort to interfere with and control any matter pertaining to Alec's death or legacy ever since.

Recently, the growing tide of murkfolk forced the Varions to swallow their pride and accept Oudaarde as allies in the war against the green dragon Acridaethruix. Walled and well-defended, Belciennes continues to thwart the rangols' efforts. However, Belciennes battle sages predict that it won't be long before their defenses falter. Even with Oudaarde's assistance, the Belciennians need the help of adventurers.

#### Vasteloc

Vasteloc is the largest of Amphibios' two lakes. While the northern and western parts of the lake are clear and cool, the taint of the Murk and Acridaethruix befouls its southeasternmost waters, transforming the lake into a boiling pool of poison and muck there. From this muck rise dreadful creatures, such as acidic [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Shambling Mound.md\|shambling mounds]] and fearsome chuuls. Boats traveling through Vasteloc stick to its western shores lest they face destruction. As murkfolk continue to press Belciennes and claim more territory, the reach of the boiling water also creeps further.

#### Ille Chaude

Ille Chaude is a large, fog-draped island at the center of Vasteloc. However, the waters surrounding the island are far enough from the Murk to all but guarantee their safety from any murkfolk assaults; sailors and anglers still avoid the island. Natives to Laterreprosp believe that the island is haunted. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]] of Oudaarde warn travelers of The Drifting Prisoner, the spirit of a woman who died alone on the island.

There is some truth to the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]]' tale. However, it is not a ghost that haunts the island but a gang of human prisoners who escaped the dungeon of one of the northern region's cities. The prisoners use the ghost story to mask their presence on the island. Hoping to redeem their past transgressions, the prisoners live as ascetics on the island.

Recently, a young rooble boy from Belciennes hoping to make a name for himself sailed to the island. The boy hoped 7 to find evidence of the Drifting Prisoner so he may rid the lake of her presence. Instead, he found the monks. The prisoners-turned-monks captured the boy, fearful that he might reveal their presence to the people of Laterreprosp. The Belciennians believe that the boy's disappearance is just another confirmation of the island's haunt.

#### Labyrinth Of Laughing Skulls

This collection of jagged canyons, deep chasms, and subterranean mazes in Chatsdown Slopes was once the home to the green dragon Dralzos. Just a little over two hundred years ago, a band of brave adventurers entered the Labyrinth and killed Dralzos. Dralzos' kobold and serpentfolk minions abandoned the lair immediately after his demise. The labyrinth sat empty for years, inviting only bizarre creatures from the realms below. Then, a few decades ago, a warband of cliff giants entered the labyrinth's canyons and claimed it as their own.

Since the giants' occupation, travel through the Chatsdown Slopes has become cumbersome. All who pass through the giants' trails must pay a hefty tollâfailure to pay results in the seizure of goods in the name of the giants' chieftain. Sometimes, the giants take trespassers as prisoners and thralls. When combined with the rise of the murkfolk in the east, this problem makes traders nervous, forcing some to avoid Amphibios altogether.

Iron traders from the south hope to clear the labyrinth of the giants so they might occupy the giants' toll booths themselves. The traders offer to pay as much as 500 gp per slain giant. Unfortunately, this bounty invites less-than-favorable personalities into Amphibios.

#### Chatsdown Slopes

This old, weathered mountain range comprises Amphibios' southwestern border. Although the straits that twist through the range are long and winding, Chatsdown Slopes are more accessible than most ranges in the region. The only issue travelers face is the presence of cliff giants demanding expensive tolls along the clear routes. See the Labyrinth of the Laughing Skull above for details.

#### Soives

Soives is a small village known for its trade depots and bustling docks on the southwestern shore of Lake Vasteloc. Non-Amphibios traders who wish to use the lake to send their wares north use Soives as their launching point. The cascade of wealth flowing through the village attracts entrepreneurs from all over the region. The Soives' ethnic makeup is considerably different from that of its parent city, Oudaarde.

Although the rooble Duchess Denise Dior rules Soives, a prominent half-elven merchant named Phayetrana openly contests the monarchy. Phayetrana hopes to implement a system of government in which the traders rule Soives. She and her faction claim that the feudal system of Amphibios hinders Duchess Dior's decision-making. If freed of Queen Wingwumm's rule, Soives would prosper.

Ironically, the Ancient Curtain nobles of Oudaarde actively oppose Phayetrana, too. Since she began her campaign to change Soives' system of rulership, the Curtain made two assassination attempts on her life. Now, Phayetrana hires adventurers and mercenaries to keep her and her closest advisors safe.

#### Drappes

Drappes was a small town just two miles northeast of Oudaarde. The murkfolk marched on Drappes and obliterated its walls with fireballs six months ago. They murdered Soives leader, Duke Gaston Chaufourier, and his family and captured or killed almost all of its citizens. A haze of green fog hangs over the town, wrought by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cloudkill.md\|cloudkill]] spells cast in its streets.

The murkfolk now use Drappes as a staging ground for attacks on Oudaarde. Resilient to poison, these servants of Acridaethruix lurk in the poisonous fog and plot new ways to seize Amphibios' most fantastic city. Brave [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Marshwarden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|marshwardens]] and well-paid mercenaries occasionally enter Drappes with hopes of clearing the ruins of the dragons' minions. So far, Oudaarde faces a stalemate.

However, there is a glimmer of hope. A week ago, a band of murkfolk rangol apostates absconded Drappes, seeking refuge in Oudaarde. Although the Queen and her advisors don't wholly trust these refugees, these defectors have offered valuable information to aid the Oudaardians in their war efforts. Furthermore, the Queen believes that there might be more murkfolk who are willing to switch sides.

#### Oudaarde

Review pages 3â6 to learn more about the city of Oudaarde.

#### Longstone

This small village offers a reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the trade culture of Drappes and the feudalistic nature of Oudaarde. Adventurers from all over the region gather in Longstone to stage their quests. The presence of adventurers is why Longstone, a village of only 300-some frog and toadfolk, has three inns. It seems as though a new shop offering adventuring gear pops up in the village every week. And despite the inflated prices these shops offer, they still fail to meet the ever-increasing demand of Longstone's transient clientele.

#### WÃ¤densstein

Those who travel south along Amphibios' roadways know that they've left Amphibios when they first glimpse WÃ¤densstein's white, gabled rooftops and blue banners. A town of 4,000 souls, primarily humans and half-elves, WÃ¤densstein rests on the border between Laterreprosp and the human kingdom to its south.

The WÃ¤denssteiners are mostly hardworking loggers and miners. The human kingdom stations a legion of soldiers at the border, playing it safe while the war between the Oudaardians and murkfolk rages.

Adventurers who aren't afraid to travel a little further south than Longstone may purchase goods and gear in WÃ¤densstein, where the prices are more reasonable, and the gear fits non-Amphibios humanoids a little better.

#### The Murk

The Murk refers to the sprawling eastern region of acidic swampland, poisonous ponds, and black forests nestled between the Northern Mountains, Vasteloc, and Lake Lebonk.

Except for Belciennes on the eastern shores of Vasteloc, the roobles and ruglunks of Amphibios actively avoid the Murk. The only settlements in this dreadful region belong to the rangols and frogres, collectively known as murkfolk.

The Murk traces its origins to the dread green dragon Joshtinovivesh. Although the old dragon vanished hundreds of years ago, his grandson, the equally awful Acridaethruix, continues the family tradition of fearmongering and warcraft. He sends his masses forward from his lair in Dragonstooth Burrow, hoping to claim all of Amphibios as his own.

Initially, Acridaethruix theorized that the absence of Oudaarde's own green dragon protector would render the city's frog and toadfolk easy prey. The Oudaardians quickly proved the dragon wrong and continued to demonstrate their tenacity in the face of Acridaethruix's hordes.

Not all murkfolk believe in Acridaethruix's cause. Vying for the same freedoms the Oudaardians possess, some rangols and frogres attempt to escape from The Murk and the green dragon's rule. Of course, those who betray even a sliver of resistance to the dragon's whims suffer grave consequences at the hands of Acridaethruix's loyalists.

#### Dragonstooth-Burrow

Read the following section to learn more about Dragonstooth Burrow, its hazards, and its murkfolk denizens.

### Dragonstooth Burrow

Dragonstooth Burrow is the home of the despicable green dragon Acridaethruix and the ancestral lair of Joshtinovivesh. The burrow hides within an old sunken castle, hidden among a magical thicket of brambles and thorns. The castle was once part of Joshtinovivesh's greater empire and used by the rangols and frogres as an eastern watchpoint.

#### The Thicket

The thicket surrounding the tower acts as the tower's first line of defense. Its thorns are dangerous. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Also, the thickets form an ever-changing labyrinth. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that heavily obscure anything behind them. A creature can move through the thickets, moving 1 foot for every 4 feet of movement spent. Finding a path through the thicket labyrinth requires a character to perform a series of DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) checks. If the character receives 4 successes before suffering four failures, they find their way through the labyrinth. Otherwise, they become hopelessly lost in the labyrinth and must start all over again. Each attempt takes 2 hours to complete. Acridaethruix's servants instinctively know their way through the labyrinth and do not take damage from the thorns. The plants clear a path for the dragon.

Because the thickets are magical, the character cannot benefit from a non-magical feature or ability that lets them 9 find their way through it, such as a ranger's Favored Terrain feature. Each 10-foot cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.

#### Acridaethruix's Spies

The thorns aren't the only danger found within 1 mile of Acridaethruix's lair. Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the burrow act as his eyes and ears. These creatures work to deceive and mislead the party.

#### Lair Features

In addition to the aforementioned thicket labyrinth surrounding the lair, the old castle has the following features.

- **Architecture.** Ancient rangol architects designed the castle, directing the strong frogres to place the heavy granite stone blocks. As such, there is nothing impressive about the stonework. Not that it matters, anyway, as thick ivy, forest creepers, and other invasive plants cover the castle's walls. Ceilings throughout the upper layers of the castle are 15-feet high, and 10-feet high in the subterranean caverns below.  
- **Doors.** What few doors still function in the castle are made from oak and hung on rusting iron hinges. A locked door requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using proficiency in thieves' tools to pick open or a successful DC 18 Strength check to break open. Doors have AC 15, 15 hp, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.  
- **Illumination.** There are few lights throughout the complex. The maze of thickets surrounding the castle and the dense canopy above block natural light. The dragon and its servants rely on their blindsight and darkvision to see.  
- **No Traces of Acridaethruix.** Acridaethruix leaves no physical evidence of his passage unless he wishes it so. Tracking him is impossible except by magical means. Furthermore, both he and his rangol and frogre servants ignore movement impediment and damage from plants in the area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thicket labyrinth surrounding the castle. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.  
- **Encounters.** For every 30 minutes the characters spend in the castle and surrounding labyrinth, roll a d20. On a result of 16â20, an encounter occurs. Use the Dragonstooth Burrow Random Encounters table below to determine the nature of the encounter.  

#### Dragonstooth Burrow Random Encounters

#### Castle Locations

The most important parts of the castle are detailed below.

##### Castle Outer Walls

Once the characters successfully navigate the dragon's thicket maze, they discover the castle's outer walls. Thick ivy hugs the walls, masking the stone. There are two ways through the walls. First, there is the gatehouse at the western side of the castle. Frogres stand guard at the gate itself, while rangols armed with poison-tipped crossbows lurk in the tower and barbican above. Second, a secret passageway hides in the northeastern corner of the outer wall. Finding this passageway requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

A character with proficiency in Nature makes this check with advantage. The passageway offers a staircase that leads down to the rangol tunnels below the castle.

The characters may also climb over the wall. However, poisonous plants and biting insects riddle the ivy covering it. Each round a character spends climbing the wall, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the character's movement speed is reduced by half. The insects deal 3 (1d6) piercing damage to any creature climbing the wall each round.

##### Courtyard

Once past the outer walls, the characters find themselves in the courtyard surrounding the central keep. Acridaethruix's frogres use the courtyard as their living area. There are 3d6 frogres here sleeping, eating, and sharpening their cruel glaives at any given time. The frogres keep dire wolves as pets. Unless the characters are careful, the wolves' keen sense of hearing and smell immediately alerts them to any trespassers entering the castle grounds.

##### Keep (Downstairs)

Other than the collapsed throne room in which Acridaethruix rests and lords over his minions, the downstairs of the castle's keep lies in ruins. Strange fey creatures, beasts tainted by the dragon's evil, and other horrors lurk within these overgrown chambers. Some of these monsters are so malicious that even the rangols fear them.

Overall, these chambers lack treasure and valuable items.

When Acridaethruix assumed control of the castle, his minions cleared the areas of anything that might be of value. The dragon keeps all of his treasure in his hoard (see below).

Peachscar. The castle's old kitchen is home to a wise-cracking [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Treant.md\|treant]] with a Charisma (Deception) bonus of +5 named Peachscar. Because Acridaethruix enjoys the old tree's presence, the dragon allows a single spot within the canopy above to shine light through the collapsed wall at the kitchen's rear. Steady rain and healthy soil keep her well-fed. Despite the dragon's acceptance, Peachscar claims no allegiance to Acridaethruix, nor does she actively oppose him. Peachscar enjoys talking to anyone who comes into the old kitchen. She also enjoys playing games; she will lie to the party about the castle's layout, hoping to catch them in a trap.

##### Keep (Upstairs)

Vine-ridden staircases wind their way up to the castle's old residential floor. Like the chambers below, the upstairs lies primarily in ruins. Portions of the roof collapsed long ago, allowing rainwater to pool and stagnate in many old rooms.

Many of the creatures that live upstairs are winged, including a colony of goblinoid-werebats (treat them as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Wererat.md\|wererats]])

with a flight speed of 60 ft while in giant bat and hybrid form) who revere Acridaethruix. Acridaethruix despises the werebats, finding them grotesque, and refuses to employ them despite their eagerness to please him.

##### Library 11

The old library is one of the few parts of the castle that remains intact. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Ghost.md\|ghost]] of a rangol sorcerer named Kuuk manages the library. In life, she was responsible for curating the library for its original inhabitants.

Although Acridaethruix is not as well-read as other green dragons his age, he enjoys a wide array of reference manuals at his disposal.

##### Laboratory

When Acridaethruix claimed the castle as his lair, he tasked his rangols and frogres to relocate the contents of his grandfather's old laboratory to a large storage room in the southeastern tower. He then hired a pair of green hagsâonly two to prevent them from forming a covenâto continue Joshinovivesh's hybrid program to create more servants. After a few years of research, the hags successfully restarted the program, not only allowing Acridaethruix to create more rangols and frogres, but new, stranger, and more terrible creatures, too.

The southernmost portion of the laboratory's tower is partially submerged. Within this pool, the hags spawn mass quantities rangol and frogre eggs. Once the eggs hatch into tadpoles, the creatures descend to the watery layers below the castle, quickly growing to full-sized creatures. The hags' process allows them to grow minions much faster than Joshinovivesh ever could. However, they unknowingly exchanged this truncated gestation period for freethinking among the new minions. As such, the hags' rangols and frogres are much more prone to resist the will of their green dragon master.

##### Rangol Caverns

A series of earthen tunnels hide below the castle, most of which are submerged in murky, brown water. It is within these tunnels that Acridaethruix's rangols gather. At any given time, there are hundreds of rangols here. Traps riddle many of these watery chambers and passages, a mark of the rangols' kobold heritage. Other aquatic and amphibious creatures make their home in the tunnels: some friendly to the rangols, while others not so much. Holes in the keep's floors allow the rangols quick access to the surface.

##### Throne Room

The old throne room covers three levels of the castle, including the subterranean caverns below it which are accessible via a collapsed portion of the floor on the castle's lower level. Acridaethruix uses the throne room as its chamber, sleeping on a ledge just below the lip of the broken floor. A hole in the roof allows Acridaethruix to come and go as he pleases. On the rare occasion that Acridaethruix accepts visitors, he transforms into a frog-humanoid form (neither rooble nor human) and takes a seat on the old stone throne at the far side of the throne room's middle level.

##### Acridaethruix's Hoard

The dragon hides its hoard in a hollow near the ledge on which he sleeps. The majority of the hoard consists of treasure collected from his grandfather's old hoard. As such, many of the relics within it are centuries old. Like most green dragons, Acridaethruix prefers colorful gems and jewels whose palettes reflect the surrounding forest. However, the dragon's most prized possession is Sir Varion's lance, which he keeps mounted on the chamber's westernmost wall.

### Example Treasure

Characters that visit Amphibios (Laterreprosp) are more likely to come across water, reptile, or swamp-themed magical items. Treasure such as the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of Buoyancy (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|amulet of buoyancy]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Anglers Wand (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|angler's wand]], [[5.

Mechanics/Items/Doubloon Divers Goggles (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|doubloon diver's goggles]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drowners Pearl (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|drowner's pearl]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Flood Pauldron (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|flood pauldron]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Helm Of The Deep Sea Knight (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|helm of the deep sea knight]], [[5.

Mechanics/Items/Wavecutter (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|wavecutter]] could be ideal for the region. Similarly, anything regarding Amphibios in its name, including Sir Varion or the Murk, originate from Amphibios and would of course be a great fit. Such items include the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Gloves Of Amphibios (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|gloves of Amphibios]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Murk Blowgun (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|murk blowgun]], [[5.

Mechanics/Items/Sir Varions Mantle (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Sir Varion's Mantle]], and [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sir Varions Shield (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Sir Varion's Shield]].

## Breezeport

Colorful, cheerful, and filled with many unique characters, Breezeport is a coastal bay city spread over lush green hills. For the most part, the weather is cool and calm in Breezeport. Summers sometimes get hot, but winters are always mild. Thanks to the presence of a local sect of druids, local water and air currents supply the bay with ample warm water and sailable skies. At any point, dozens of small, colorful sailboats can be seen dotting the bay's rich blue water. Thanks to its central location between several large regional cities, its culture became a rich tapestry of art, history, and commerce. As such, Breezeport is a common stop for resting and resupplying for hundreds of importers, exporters, and merchants.

Breezeport is a city that believes in two principles. First, every sentient creature has the right to be free and do as they please so long as it doesn't affect others. Second, every creature is entirely responsible for the consequences of its actions. Many locals carry at least some form of light, but practical, means of protection, as their shared responsibility for the law sometimes means enforcing it. With hundreds of adventurers making their home in this sprawling city of 15,000, Breezeport's citizens have little to fear from outside dangers.

Before the city was safe for the average citizen, however, it was a minor port for dangerous pirates and outcast sailors. Two centuries ago, over a period of ten years, all but the most resolute pirates up and left the then rough-and-tumble city. A relentless series of inexplicable and extraordinary circumstancesâpranksâdrove the pirates to the brink of exasperation. Convinced that the city itself was out to get them, the dangerous sort that once called Breezeport home left in a bloodless exodus that made way for others to thrive there.

Despite Breezeport's vastly improved outlook, it still has its share of troubles. Economic woes run rampant through the city as its figurehead, Duke Rhodes, drains the city's coffers to pay for his frequent flights of fancy. Criminal masterminds lurk in the shadows, taking advantage of the city's laisse-fair attitude. And a band of experienced dragon hunters haunts the streets, convinced that a mighty metallic dragon was responsible for the founders' departure.

### Citizenry

A sprawling coastal town, the homes and businesses of Breezeport cascade down from the hills that surround it. A vast majority of Breezeport's citizens live a transient life, sailing from one point to the next. Those who remain are retired sailors, businesses to support the nautical culture, or those who view Breezeport as a safe haven. Despite the copious amount of gold coins that trade hands in Breezeport, many of its citizens are relatively poor. Fortunately, the good weather allows them to forego the creature comforts of larger, inland cities. Homelessness is less a burden in Breezeport than it is a way of life.

While traditional wealth certainly funds plenty of luxuries within Breezeport, one's social status often relies on one's social currency. Those who perform good deeds, help others, and maintain a positive outlook earn high marks among the city's predominantly liberty-minded inhabitants. Meanwhile, those who have poison in their hearts, do little to assist others, or only think for themselves find themselves at the bottom rungs of Breezeport society. Not even gold will buy these ne'er-do-wells entry into the city's finest halls.

#### Demographics

Breezeport is home to roughly 15,000 citizens and it is a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities. A visitor is just as likely to run across a human fighter dressed in the finest military regalia as they are to come across a dragonborn sorcerer from lands distant and exotic.

#### Languages And Dialects

Most of Breezeport's citizens speak Common by virtue of convenience, especially when it comes to trade. Other popular trade languages include Dwarven, Goblin, and, to some extent, Draconic.

### Atmosphere

Just as the rush of warm, comfortable air tackles the unfurled sails of Breezeport's countless vessels, a feeling of hospitality and friendliness fills the air in Breezeport. Bunting flags, paper lanterns, and wreathes of flowers decorate the buildings, streets, and ships. The smell of fresh baked goods, salted meats, and fresh fish is everywhere. Children play without fear of reprisal, couples laugh and hold hands, and burly sailors emit raucous laughter heard everywhere. If a fight breaks out, it's all in good funâfriends laughing as they bloody noses and bruised eyes. There are guards, certainly, but for the most part they ensure that newcomers understand that Breezeport is a city that exists by the goodwill of its people. In the rare times of trouble, it's Breezeports citizensâand innumerable adventurersâwho take to arms, repelling those who would disrupt the city's utopia.

### Government

Labeling Breezeport's government a "ruling body" is erroneous at best. Although the city has a "leader" by the name of Duke Rhodes, the city more or less manages itself. This laissez-faire attitude towards rulership requires its citizens to stand up for themselves, of course, so there are plenty who view the libertine nature of Breezeport as a burden. But the city functions best when its citizens are left to their own devices.

#### Duvra

Duvra is an ancient silver dragon (see the appendix). He is the one responsible for chasing the city's bloodthirsty founders from the city. Of course, he didn't rid the city of the pirates on purpose. Duvra loves pranks, especially when made against those with little-to-no sense of humor. The angrier the pirates got, the more pranks Duvra pulled. Of course, very few of Breezeport's citizens actually know that Duvra exists. To them, Duvra is nothing more than a legend, or a bedtime story Breezeport's working-class tells their children to warn them from taking life too seriously.

The few pirates who stayed in town revere the silver dragon, remembering the chaos it caused in the early days. Most 3 of Breezeport's citizens are skeptical of the pirates' claims. They believe that the pirates left Breezeport because of in-fighting and increased military patrols in foreign waters. Duvra does little to disprove these rumors.

Duvra appears among people in any number of humanoid disguises, but often assumes the form of a young boy in a green tunic. He also takes on the guise of various beasts, like crows or stray cats, that whisper riddles or collect unguarded trinkets. In general, the dragon's favorite pranks are the ones that either embarrass or leave more questions than answers. They're almost always physically harmless.

Duvra's lair hides beneath the docks at the Southern edge of the bay. Accessible by a series of magically concealed trap doors and false walls, this underground coastal cave is home to the dragon's centuries of stolen wealth and coveted trinkets. Stuffed animals that once belonged to pirate captains, scandalous love letters between notorious socialites, glass frogs, and more unusual nicknacks comprise the dragon's whimsical collection.

#### Duke Rhodes

Duke Rhodes (CN male human **noble**) is the self-proclaimed leader of Breezeport. Although Rhodes is a spendthrift and incorrigible brat, ultimately, he is a kind and friendly person who, despite his braggadocious manner, always puts the needs of the city before his own. For this reason, Breezeport's citizens allow him to continue his charade. Furthermore, he's a merchant of scandal and gossip, who isn't afraid to blackmail others into submission.

A distant relative of an original Breezeport pirate, Rhodes is an active believer in Duvra who takes extraordinary precautions against Duvra's attempts to bully him into leaving. Half of his lavish spending and activities are made in defiance of Duvra in an almost supernatural game of cat and mouse between the two. Rhodes finds the game to be a keen exercise in wits. While Duvra believes he's finally found a target worth pranking. Round and round it goes.

Little does the old dragon realize that the Duke's job is to draw its attention away from one of Breezeport's biggest power players, Mister Marble (see below). The Duke suffers Duvra's games, allowing Mister Marble to serve as Breezeport's true shadow lord.

#### The Silver Lords

If there were any one true ruling body in Breezeport, that title would go to its merchant guilds. Although the guilds are not official, they ensure the quality and service of Breezeport's myriad vendors. Those who hope to achieve membership in a guild must serve as an apprentice for at least two years with a guild's master crafter or trader, at which point they may graduate to journeyman status and earn membership. A journeyman must then prove their worth with four years of service to the city. At the end of this duration, the journeyman may test for master's status, awarded by their respective guild's master crafters.

Certainly, a merchant may sell their wares without a guild membership. However, most Breezeporters know that spending hard-earned coin on a non-member merchant is a risky bet.

While these guilds exist to ensure the customer experience in Breezeport, their control of the city's coin gives them immeasurable power over the city's economy. As such, Breezeport's citizens refer to those who manage the guilds as The Silver Lords.

#### Mister Marble

Perhaps the most well-known and important of all of Breezeport's Silver Lords, Mister Marble is an influential guild master in the Glassblower's Guild. As his true name is unpronounceable to those from the Prime Material plane, Mister Marble gained his monicker from the polished, stonelike surface of his dark skin.

Because glass products and windows are one of the most profitable ventures and exports in the city, Mister Marble uses his considerable sway to direct the city's trade any way he pleases. He is responsible for many of the city's civic projects, too, including the roadways, docks, and general maintenance. Even the city's defense owes its existence to Mister Marble's deep coin purse. Marble doesn't outwardly come off as a villain, but those who get in the way of his desires or work against him often find themselves at odds with all of the city's guilds for fear of retribution.

### Defense

There are no official guards in the city beyond a handful of volunteers who work as the eyes and the ears of Breezeport's true defenders, the multitudinous adventurers, bodyguards, and swords-for-hire who frequent the city. In the rare instance the city comes under attack or a violent event breaks out, every hero in town rises to the ocassion to squash the trouble.

The closest thing the city has to an organized militia is Mister Marble's bodyguard retinue, The Blocks. True to their name, the Blocks are a group of two dozen or so earth elementals who keep their rough edges chiseled, giving them a brick-like appearance. The Blocks answer only to Marble.

### Commerce

Breezeport earns nearly three times as much as any other city of its size in the region. The sheer volume of coinage flowing through its businesses owes its existence to the lack of governance in the city, the presence of The Silver Lords (see above), and its prime location. While Breezeport creates plenty of its own goods, the majority of its earnings come from services. Heroes offer their services for adventuring needs while bodyguards offer to protect warehouses holding valuables. Because there are no laws preventing illegal products, it's also a good place to store and trade items other settlements would deem "black market" goods. While traditional taxes aren't collected on such services, those who earn a living in Breezeport are expected to pay their "fair share" to ensure the success of the city. This tithe earns entrepreneurs social currency and protects them from the ire of the city's higher-ups.

Many of Breezeport's citizens forego earning an income altogether. Referred to as Janglers (for the sound their cups make when begging for coins) by the nobles, this caste relies on the generosity of the wealthy elite who seek to improve their social status in Breezeport.

### Other Factions & Organizations

Other notable factions in the city include the following groups.

#### Black Warthog Riders

Look out! The Black Warthog Riders are crashing down the street! This group of screaming goblins comprises one of Breezeport's most notorious gangs. And as the name suggests, they ride on the back of black-furred warthogs. Leading the gang is a snaggle-toothed **goblin** named Hickory Stick. A few years back, Hickory Stick woke up hungover in a pig sty. Broke and tired of Breezeport's other goblinoids bullying him, he decided to train the biggest and ugliest boar to serve as his mount. That boarâCuddlebugâhelped Hickory Stick earn his status as one of the toughest goblins in town. Quickly, other small goblins in similar situations begged to join the gang. "Train a pig and you can ride with us," Hickory told them. So they did. Although the Black Warthog Riders qualify as a gang, they target only those they consider bullies. After chasing away the hobgoblins from Breezeport, they turned their attention to Mister Marble and his cronies. They haven't yet affected enough of Marble's business for the shadow lord to take notice, but they are persistent.

#### Captain Huik And The Silent Deceit

One of the few holdovers from Breezeport's age of piracy, Captain Huik (pronounced "HUE-ick") and the crew of the Silent Deceit keep anchor a few thousand yards away from Breezeport's docks. Like most of the old pirates who haunted this part of the coast, Huik believes that it was a silver dragon that chased away the area's criminal element. With every waking breath, he swears vengeance against his unseen foe, spending the fortune gained in his younger years to identify, track, and ultimately, kill the dragon. Ivo the Invincible is just one of many hunters employed by Huik. Happy to continue their age-old games, Duvra humors the venerable pirate and tricks the old man by transforming into various gulls, rats, and even fish that whisper nonsensical riddles to him when no one else is there to see. Some wonder what old Huik would even do if he caught the dragon. Would he actually try and kill Duvra? Or would he turn the other way, recognizing that Duvra might be the only purpose driving him in his twilight years? Huik's recent involvement with the Duvran cults around the city point toward the latter.

#### Daisy Z And The Feathered Masks

Second maybe only to Mister Marble, Daisy Z is possibly Breezeport's most influential personality. Daisy Z runs the Feathered Masks, an escort house higher up Breezeport's hillside. Be wary of your tongueâDaisy Z's is not some common bordello. Her veritable army of masked escorts does more than just cater to their callers' physical needs. Daisy Z's masks serve as companions, confidants, and sometimes even spies. Earning one's mask requires years of training, education, and oversight. As such, Feathered Masks are the best-educated people in the city, some rivaling even the region's top sages. Daisy Z herself is a lawful neutral female half-elf using the **Feathered Mask leader** stat block (see the appendix), but she hides her magical abilities from everyone, including the masks.

#### Ivo The Invincible And His Four Awesome Axes

The dragon hunter Ivo the Invincible hails from lands cold and distant where white dragons frequently terrorize villages. Ivo stands almost seven feet tall and has a barrel of a chest. His face is scarred from dragon claws and frostbite and he rarely laughs. Always at his side are his Four Awesome Axes, his entourage. Ironically, none of them carry an axe and there are actually five of them. Captain Huik of the Silent Deceit (see below) hired Ivo to track and kill the silver dragon Duvraâthat was six years ago. Each report Ivo gives claims that he is "one step closer" to finding the beast. Of course, it's all a ploy. Ivo actually works for Duvra. The two are old friends from Ivo's youth. The pair split the egregious sums of silver that Huik pays to keep Ivo and his squad on the payroll. However, if Huik ever found out about this deception, he might offer an adventuring party even more silver to punish Ivo for the slight.

#### Conflicts

Although Breezeport is hardly what one would label a "troubled city," it isn't without its conflicts. These conflicts open doorways to adventure in Breezeport.

#### Captain Huik Versus Duvra

Captain Huik of the Silent Deceit knows that there is a dragon somewhere in Breezeportâif only he could find proof !

Once a wealthy pirate, Huik has drained nearly all of his old treasure horde to find and kill the dragon responsible for chasing away Breezeport's pirate founders and his old way of life. Countless hunters on Huik's payroll have tried to find the so-called "Dragon of Breezeport." So far, all have failed. Only Ivo the Invincible and His Four Awesome Axes (see above) remain, claiming to find new leads every week. Meanwhile, Duvra, in disguise as an "ageless boy in a green tunic" hires adventurers to pull pranks on the elderly pirate.

#### Breezeport'S Shadow Lord

Duke Rhodes may claim to be Breezeport's leader, but he is only a puppet. Mister Marble is the true puppet master, and one of the few people who know for certain of Duvra's existence. Marble pays the Duke to maintain a visible profile and encourages Rhodes' extravagant events. The shadow lord uses this tactic to distract the dragon while he amasses more and more power among Breezeport's elite. Although Marble's business originally manufactured and exported glass products, it now stretches into nearly every other business venture in the city. An expert at gaining social currency, Marble hides behind a facade of philanthropy and kindness. But Marble only wants one thingâpower. Sooner or later, he will have enough resources to remove Duvra, the one thing keeping him from true power in Breezeport. Adventurers might uncover Marble's true plot. In doing so, they invite the attention of a deadly and well-connected enemy, one of whom hides behind countless layers of misdirection.

#### Terror Of The Greille

There is a secret menace in Breezeport. Colloquially called "pilfurrs," but known by the fae as **greille** (see the appendix), these creatures are responsible for stealing countless coin purses, magic items, and even shoelaces all over the city. Quick and stealthy, very few catch a glimpse of the culprits. Those who do report that the creatures look like large chipmunks with large, almost alien eyes. They sneak up on unsuspecting targets, grab their money or weapons, then stuff the stolen item in their mouths andvanish. Rumor has it that they're servants of Duvra, and Duke Rhodes can't be bothered to deal with the issues of the "lower class." In truth, the greille first arrived on an elven caravan from afar, but have exploded in numbers and made the city their home on the Material Plane. Fortunately, the Black Warthog Riders recognize the problem the creatures cause Breezeport's commonfolk and actively seek to end the Terror of the Greille. The Riders' leader, Hickory Stick, offers considerable social currency (mostly in the form of protection or muscle) for any group of adventurers willing to help find the troublemakers.

If the players can successfully find a greille burrow, they're likely to find a tidy sum of gold and other valuable trinkets. If a large burrow were to exist, its fortunes could potentially make even Duvra jealous.

#### The Ghoul

Recently, two of Daisy Z's masks turned up dead. Both masks were poisoned and a large bite was left on their right forearms. Daisy Z hired a band of adventurers to find the killer (or killers), but then they, too, were found deadâalso poisoned with bites on their arms. Legend quickly spread of a serial killer dubbed "The Ghoul." As one of the most intelligent and capable groups in Breezeport, the Feathered Masks rarely know fear. But The Ghoul causes Daisy Z considerable concern. If the Feathered Masks can't find the one responsible for the murders, who can? Much to her chagrin, Daisy Z put out a call for the region's best investigators. Perhaps one of the characters will answer her call and put an end to The Ghoul's reign of terror?

If the Ghoul is pursued and found by the players, it's revealed that the Ghoul is actually a **wereboar** that remains in boar form and ridden by the Black Boar Riders. Whether or not its goblin rider knows the boar's identity and is complicit in the murders remains to be seen.

### Locations In Breezeport

This entries lists some of Breezeport's most popular locations.

#### The Two Drunk Lovers

Once upon a time, there were two three-story taverns in Breezeport situated across the street from each other. The two tavern owners were fierce competitors. Few nights would pass without the two shouting drunken slurs at each other from their respective windows. As fate would have it, both buildings were poorly built, hastily assembled from the gutted remnants of wrecked pirate ships. With each passing year, both buildings started to lean into the narrow street until eventually, the tops touched each other, creating an unusual arch. Breezeporters, thinking the pair of taverns resembled a couple of sots keeping each other propped up, renamed them The Two Drunk Lovers. Now, hardly anyone even remembers the taverns' old names. Eventually, the two tavern owners stopped their bickering and recognized they have more in common than they originally thought. This year marks their seventh wedding anniversary.

#### Daggers By JÃ¶l

Breezeport's most famous high-end shop, Daggers by JÃ¶l (pronounced Y-ewww-l), does not seem like a high-end shop at all. In fact, one might be forgiven for completely walking past it without noticing it. There are no signs on the door, nor is it in a commercial district. With little more than a 15-foot-square workroom floor, it is nearly indistinguishable from a residential shack. And eponymous JÃ¶l is a plain-looking human man with a plain-looking apron who creates plain-looking daggers. Every dagger is nearly identical with the exception of the number carved into the pommel. Since JÃ¶l only makes one dagger each month, he has only crafted 98 in the 10 years he's been in business. What makes JÃ¶l's so extraordinary, however, is the price he charges per dagger: 100,000 gp. Newcomers to town scoff at the ridiculous price, believing it a joke. But JÃ¶l is not known for his incredible sense of humor. "That's the price," he always responds. "And not a copper less."

As the story goes, JÃ¶l was just a simple smith trying to eke out a living in Breezeport. Duvra, in his "ageless boy in a green tunic" form, took pity on the man and offered to pay 100,000 gp for a dagger. JÃ¶l obliged and created the daggerhis sixth. Duvra wore the dagger proudly, showing it off it at parties, bragging about how it was only the sixth in the collection, and how only "those who truly want to demonstrate their value as a Breezeporter simply *must* have one." The hype worked and soon the wealthy aristocrats scrambled to get their own dagger by JÃ¶l.

With no family and no desire for luxuries, JÃ¶l donates almost all of his money to various charities and civic projects around the city. Duvra chose wisely.

#### Who Owns Which Dagger?

Dagger **Owner**

1 JÃ¶l's estranged son Kielle

2 JÃ¶l

#### Chateau Rhodes

A testament to the Duke's ridiculously extravagant nature, Chateau Rhodes is a colossal eyesore on the Breezeport skyline. Marble towers traced with gold and pearl, courtyards filled with exotic pets, and room after room filled with overpriced furniture, trophies, and art objects are just a few of the egregious touches the Duke's palace possesses.

Nearly every night of the week the Duke holds a festival, soiree, parade, or other outrageous ceremonies to celebrate whatever he currently fancies. Frequent partygoers use the Duke's numerous guest rooms to collapse after long nights filled with debauchery.

#### Temple Of Fortune

The Temple of Fortune assumes the appearance of an ascetic monastery on the outskirts of Breezeport. Monks dressed in plain, brown robes mill about the premises, offering blessings to those who approach. Each day, the great iron bell atop the main chapel's bell tower signals sunrise, noon, and sunset.

Of course, it's all a gimmick. The Temple of Fortune is not a temple at all, but a casino. The "monks" are actually actors playing the role of clergy dedicated to some nameless god of fortune. Within the actual monastery, patrons partake in games of chance while drinking the so-called monks' finest ales and wines.

The Temple of Fortune is one of Mister Marble's (see above) many ventures, but few realize it. A bald-headed monk with a warty nose named Brother Aethelstan acts as the casino's manager, hiding all clues of Marble's involvement.

### Sailboat Races

Characters looking to do something outside of the norm might turn their attention to Breezeport's sailboat races. Held during the summer months when the storms are few, the sailboat races are the pride of the city's wealthy, poor, and everyone in between. A typical race day has three races: short, medium, and long-distance. Short-distance race courses are 5 miles long and take roughly an hour for most ships to complete. Medium-distance courses are 40 miles long and take a full day of sailing. And long-distance races cover a total distance of 1,000 miles and can take as long as a week to complete.

There are two ways the characters may participate: as betters, or as sailors.

#### Betting On The Races

Characters can bet on the sailors in the races to earn some extra gold. The racers, the available odds, and the chance to win are listed on the Betting of the Sailboat Races tables below. Bets can range from 1 cp to 500 gp. Once bets are placed, roll a die for each bet. Losing bets cost the full amount of the water. Winning bets payout according to the table. The bookies expect losers to pay up in a timely fashion. Those who don't are visited by a debt collector, usually employees of one of Mister Marble's organizations (1d4 + 1 thugs, **pirate** bruisersâsee the appendixâor **gladiators**, depending on the level of the party). Failure to pay a financial debt often hurts one's social currency.

Sailboat races are one of Breezeport's most beloved pastimes and sports, often attracting hundreds of spectators to any given race. Fans cheer on their favored vessels and crews, waving colorful banners and flags high and shouting all manner of encouragement (and profanities) as they sail by. Player characters may get involved in sailing races, either through their own interest, to settle a wager or earn social currency, or at the behest of a quest-giver. The players must decide which race they wish to join: short, medium, or long-distance. The characters must supply their own vessel. If they can't afford to own one, they may rent one from the list below. The ship's speed rating is the average number of miles it travels in an hour so long as it isn't sailing into the wind. Dexterity represents the ship's ease of handling.

Regardless of the race in which they choose to participate, have the characters perform a skill challenge. A skill challenge simulates a task requiring more time and effort than a single ability check. In its simplest form, the characters make a series of ability checks to earn a required number of successes before accumulating a maximum number of failed checksâsimilar to death saving throws. This skill challenge consists of the following elements:

Goal and Context. The characters must win a sailboat race.

Difficulty. Primary skill checks related to this skill challenge are made against DC 15. Secondary checks are made against DC 20, as are repeat checks made during short or medium-distance races. A character who performs more than one check related to a short- or medium-distance skill challenge makes each subsequent check after the first with disadvantage.

Complexity. Complexity refers to the number of ability checks that the characters must make related to the challenge. The more successes they score, the better their odds are of winning the race. The length of the race determines the number of ability checks required, as shown on the Sailboat Skill Challenge table below.

Primary Checks. When the characters partake in a skill challenge, each character may commit any ability check they like to the skill challenge. Certain ability checks, however, lend themselves better to a successful outcome than others. These ability checks are primary checks and usually have a lower DC than their secondary checks. The primary checks for this skill challenge depend on the length of the race, as shown below.

y *Short-Distance Races*. Intelligence using proficiency in water vehicles and a special Strength (Athletics) check that has a bonus or penalty equal to the ship's Dexterity modifier.

y *Medium-Distances Races*. Intelligence using proficiency in water vehicles, Wisdom (Perception), and a special Strength (Athletics) check that has a bonus or penalty equal to the ship's Dexterity modifier.

y *Long-Distance Races*. Intelligence using proficiency in water vehicles, Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Perception), a special Constitution check that has a bonus equal to a roll of the character's largest Hit Die (which doesn't spend the Die), and a special Strength (Athletics) check that has a bonus or penalty equal to the ship's Dexterity modifier.

Secondary Checks. Secondary checks represent all the skills the characters may use to participate in a skill challenge that aren't considered primary checks. The main reason for the disparity between primary and secondary is that primary checks are a little more "obvious" in their function.

| Race Length | Checks | Maximum | Time Bonus per |
|-------------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Time | Success Subtract a number  of hours equal to the  ship's speed rating  plus 1d4 |
| LongDistance | 14 | 168 hours  (7 days) | Subtract a number of  minutes equal to the  ship's speed rating  times 1d4 |
| 1,440 |
| MediumDistance | 6 | minutes  (1 day) | Subtract a number of  minutes equal to the  ship's speed rating  plus 1d4 |
| 60 minutes (1 |
| ShortDistance | 3 | hour) |
| S h o r t-Di s ta n c e Fi n i s h i n g Ti m e s Place Competitor Finish Time | Payout |
| 1st | The Guide | 34 minutes | 50 gp |
| 2nd | The Sliver | 38 minutes | 25 gp |

| 10th | Loyalty | 59 minutes | - |
^race-length-checks-maximum-time-bonus-per

Other Conditions. The length of time it takes to complete the skill challenge depends on the length of the race and the number of successes the characters earn.

If the first check that a character succeeds on is a DC 15 Intelligence check using proficiency in water vehicles, the characters gain a +2 on all other primary checks related to the skill challenge.

Consequences. Tally all of the characters' successes. Refer to the Time Bonus per Success column on the Sailboat Skill Challenge below to determine how much time the characters saved during the race. Subtract that amount from the maximum time to come up with the party's result. Then, compare their results to the respective table to determine where they placed among the other competitors. Each table shows the payout for winning that particular race in that position.

Example: the party participates in a long-distance race in a poor-quality racing vessel. They succeed on 10 of the 14 required checks. For each success they earned, they rolled a d4 and multiplied the result by 4 (their ship's Speed Rating) for a total of 65 hours. Subtracting 65 hours from 168 hours (or 7 days) it takes the party 103 hours to complete the long-distance race (or 4 days and 7 hours). Comparing their results to the rest of the competitors on the Long-Distance Finishing Times table below, they see that they finished after *The Dimple* but before *The Path*. They finished fourth.

### Random Encounters

A party will find it hard not to find something to do while they are in Breezeport. However, if the characters spend enough time exploring the city, a random encounter or two will help underline some of the city's unique details. Roll a d20 three times per day of game time, checking for encounters each morning, afternoon, and evening or night. An encounter occurs on a roll of 16 or higher. Roll a d12 and check the Random Encounters in Breezeport table to determine what the characters encounter or simply choose one that you like.

#### R A N **Do M En Co U N T E R S I N Br E E Z E P O R T** D12 **Encounter**

3 1 A colorful parrot berates one of the characters.

2 A crane drops a crate holding a **tiger**. Scared and confused, the tiger goes on a rampage and must be calmed, restrained, or killed. "Gangway!" a voice shouts. A gang of 1d4 + 1 goblins riding **boars** charge down the street after a **greille** (see the appendix) that stole from a local vendor. The goblins are members of the Black Warthog Riders. A surly-looking sailor (**scout**) with a peg leg stops the characters and asks if they wish to "Join the Hunt!" The woman's name is Hot Foot Jo and she works for Captain Huik. She wants to recruit more dragon hunters.

5 One of the feathered masks (spy that can cast charm person and *command* each once per day; save DC 13) nearly crashes into the characters. The mask says nothing and continues on their way. "Huzzah!" shouts a young boy wearing a long green tunic. With wooden sword in hand, the boy leads a group of other youths to fight imaginary dragons. The youth is actually the **ancient silver** dragon Duvra in its "ageless boy in a green tunic" disguise.

A character with a relatively low passive Wisdom (Perception) score spots a **greille** (see the appendix) a few feet ahead. The fey holds one of the character's prized possessions in its hands. As soon as the greille realizes that it's been spotted, it dashes away with the coveted item.

8 A guard tosses a bucket of water onto a **noble** who fell asleep in an alley. The noble scoffs and yawns, then asks the characters to escort them back to the Chateau Rhodes.

#### D12 **Encounter**

10 One of the characters spots a dead body stuffed into a dung cart. The corpse is another one of The Ghoul's victims, with the telltale bite marks on their left arm.

11 An aggressive pair of pirates (a **pirate bruiser**

and **pirate demonlitionist**; see the appendix) are harassing and threatening shop owners in search of easy money.

12 In a dark alley, one of the characters sees a group of hooded figures whispering in a circle. Further investigation reveals that it's a group of 1d4 + 1 **Duvran fanaticists** (see the appendix) giggling about their latest acts of trickery and ill-gotten trinkets.

### Example Treasure

Most magic items in Breezeport are in some ways connected to ocean travel, pirating, commerce, or simple luxuries. That said, the frequent stream of adventurers and transients moving through the city (and gambling away their hard-earned treasures) mean that, if you look hard enough, you're likely to find at least *something* out of the ordinary. Sample treasures for this city include the ambitious medic's box, *amulet of* buoyancy, angler's armor, brawler's ring, camper's respite, captain's pride, dragon turtle gumbo, diorama die, *fortune's fivepence*, helm of the deep sea knight, helmsman's shelter, Horatio's impossible ship in a bottle, incredible mending tape, seafarer's jacket, singing stein, staff of the magpie, storm seer lamp, *tea weird*, and *tide* turner. For obvious reasons, the *silver coin of Duvra* originates from Breezeport. If you're looking for thematic weaponry, the courtesan's fanblade, crashing tide hammer, *giant captain's hook*, marlin lunger, *Medzo's crossbow* and blade, *riptide crossbow*, and wavecutter are all excellently suited for the culture and people of Breezeport.
