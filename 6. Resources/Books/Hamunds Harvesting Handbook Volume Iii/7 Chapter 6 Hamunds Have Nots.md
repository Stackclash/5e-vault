# Chapter 6: Hamund's Have-Nots
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III, p. 119* 

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> There is some primal need in all of us to use the gifts that nature provides and repurpose them to aid in our everyday lives. Unfortunately, not everyone has the strength to fulfill that need. In those cases, they turn to people like us: adventurers with combat and harvesting ability. I have compiled a list of needy individuals that are willing to part with a few coins in exchange for the creature parts they need. Feel free to take them up on their offer if you have the time or opportunity, they will thank you for it (and so will your wallet).

The following is a list of quests featuring every single monster from "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes". The aim is to provide a quick quest or incentive for Dungeon Masters to throw to their players, or to give an extra incentive to hunt down a particular monster.

## Understanding the Board

The following is a basic rundown of how to read and use the quest board. The quest board is designed to be used on the fly by Dungeon Masters, and groups are encouraged to adapt these to their own tables.

### CR

All quests are separated out by Challenge Rating in ascending order and the in alphabetical order based on the Target. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to look up a Challenge Rating appropriate for their party and then to pick a target appropriate for their current environment.

### Target

This lists the creature to be hunted in the quest, listed in alphabetical order.

### Request

This is the harvesting material being asked for by the quest giver. More often than not, a material with no explicit mechanical use has been chosen for the request. This is so that players do not have to choose between completing a quest or keeping the material for themselves to use.

Many quests also allow the players to supply the requested material more than once, getting an additional bounty each time.

### Requester Name

The name of the quest giver. Feel free to change the names to suit your own game. Also note that some quest givers appear more than once, often asking for similar items or to achieve similar goals. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to use these as NPCs in their own game or adapt them as they need.

### Race

The race of the quest giver. Most races chosen are from the "Player's Handbook", and especially from the "main" races of [[5. Mechanics/Races/Human.md\|Human]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Elf.md\|Elf]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Dwarf.md\|Dwarf]], and [[5. Mechanics/Races/Halfling.md\|Halfling]]. This was in order to make them as adaptable to individual tables as possible. That said, some esoteric races also appear such as [[5. Mechanics/Races/Tiefling.md\|Tiefling]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Goliath (MPMM).md\|Goliath]], [[5. Mechanics/Races/Tabaxi (MPMM).md\|Tabaxi]], etc. If any of these contradict your own games, you are encouraged to adapt them to your own table.

### Suggested Locations

The environment that the target is often found in. Use this to help determine if a quest is appropriate, given your party's current location. The possible environments are as follows:

- Arctic  
- Cave  
- Coast  
- Desert  
- Forest  
- General  
- Grassland  
- Mountain  
- Swamp  
- Urban  

"General" denotes that the creature can appear in any environment.

### Description

A brief explanation of the requirements of the quest, and the motivation of the quest giver in asking for the material. While the "Description" of the quest is designed to be read verbatim by a present NPC, they may also be included as written notices on a job board, or simply used as inspiration for the Dungeon Master to interpret to fit their own campaigns.

Occasionally, the motivation for retrieving a material may be at odds with the personality of the party. In these cases, the Dungeon Master may feel free to either change the motivation, or to incorporate it into their actual campaign. As always, information in this book is intended to be used to support the play-style of the individual table, and groups are encouraged to adapt it to their own games.

### Reward

The bounty given to the players for successfully retrieving the requested material. This amount is usually 1.5Ã— the normal price of the material. The price is given per request delivered.

However, many quests offer the option for the players to submit the request more than once. This is not explicitly stated, but it is implied in the description of the quest. In such cases, the players may receive the same reward each time they hand in the requested material.

Duergar use steeder legs to make adhesives and I want to learn more about this fascinating craft. It may seem silly, but I genuinely think that if I can spread this knowledge among my own kin, we can feel just a little bit closer to the cousins we forsook so long ago.

But other than the exorbitant land taxes, one of the annoying things about owning such a large home is how much it takes to illuminate the place. Buying candles isn't that annoying, it's all the time I have to spend replacing them. That's why I would like to make some candles out of nupperibo blubber: I've heard that stuff can last for a long time. Get me some, would you? It would certainly make my existence much easier.

Even greater is that I managed to snag some of their brews on my way out. Apparently, this drink is called 'fade' and its brewed from the slime of an oblex. Well, it helped me forget all my troubles and I've developed a taste for it. I'd love to get some if you can find any.

I don't know he does it, but I've had enough. I'm going to make a hook that's impossible to escape from, if they even get close to it, they'll be stuck on it forever. I'll need something more than the materials I have right now though. I've heard some fangs from some sorrowsworn creatures might be able to do it. Get me some won't you? I'll even let you take some of the fish that I catch with it.

I need a really heavy-duty insect repellant, something that'll last for days on end. Kruthik musk works pretty well from what I've heard. I need as much as I can get so I'll take anything you got.

If you come across their corpses, we will pay a bounty to recover their remains and give them the respect they deserve.

There are many ways to bolster morale, but I have heard of a new technique that involves the black blood of a sword wraith. As morbid as it sounds to use the remains of a dead soldier to empower a live one, war is a messy business, and there is no space for reservations.

Unfortunately, sometimes I have nothing to go off but a discarded glove or old shoe. I could rely on a hunting hound, but I've found them to be unreliable in the past. No, what I would prefer is an orthon tusk. I've heard those things can track down anything anywhere with perfect accuracy. I have some city funds to compensate you if you bring me one. Really, the city would be saving money with the amount of my overtime it wouldn't have to pay anymore.

It is his firm belief that he will be assassinated in the near future and that none of his clerics will be nearby to revive him in time. As such, he has charged me with procuring something that will do away with reliance on other people. I believe the nagpa can yield a brand of the raven queen that allows the holder to cheat death. My employer is a rich man, and if you can help keep him happy, I am sure you will be well compensated.

However, for some reason my clients constantly second-guess and undermine me, much to their own detriment. To that end, I've decided that simply charming them would be easier than convincing them, and I have been told that the tooth of an amnizu can make that easier. Do not worry, I will not make them do anything against their best interests while they are under my influence. After all, I am extremely professional.

I was willing to put up with it at first, until the first time that I suddenly blacked out and then reappeared one day later several acres from my house. It's high time that I investigate this mess, but first I'm going to need something to protect me from this strange vanishing magic. The horn of a nightwalker is said to act as a ward against banishment; I'm sure if I have one it should give me the defense I need.

Our home is woefully undefended from magical incursions and I think it's time we fixed that. I have heard that the blood of an astral dreadnought can put a stop to mages teleporting in and out of here like it's a roadside inn, and they also have more than enough to paint a line around our most important buildings.

They think it will prevent us mortals from accessing their esoteric metallurgy techniques. Unfortunately for them, they've never gone up against the dogged determination of a Holderhek. I am thoroughly convinced that if I can get my hands on enough samples of their weapon ichor, I can figure out exactly what goes into their weapons and end up gaining the blacksmithing skills of the Demon Lords themselves.

Problem is, I'd never be able to get it myself seeing as how dangerous the marut are in battle. If you get me some, I'd pay a high price for it.
