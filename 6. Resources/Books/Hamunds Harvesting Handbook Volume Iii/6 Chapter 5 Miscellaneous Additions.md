# Chapter 5: Miscellaneous Additions
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III, p. 67* 

> [!quote]- A quote from Hamund  
> 
> It has been so heartening to see how my fans have taken the teachings of my books into every aspect of their lives. Indeed, entire industries have sprung up with this recent harvesting boom. Items, equipment, and tools are just the start. Now, entire martial and magical schools have arisen to incorporate harvesting into their teachings. I have been lucky enough to meet a few of them, and I agreed to include their findings in this book (and at a good royalty fee as well).

This guide introduces a few new concepts into the base game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and as part of that, a few slight alterations and/or additions need to be made to existing concepts and features in the game to accommodate them. While some of these changes are not strictly necessary for this guide to be used, they are advised in order to get the maximum value out of this book.

## Special Tools

A few new pieces of adventuring gear have been added in this book to accommodate the act of harvesting. Their functions are described below:
