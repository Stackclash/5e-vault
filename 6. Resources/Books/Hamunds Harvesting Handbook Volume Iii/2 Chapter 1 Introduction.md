> I do apologise for my prolonged absence and the delay in producing this entry in the Harvesting Handbook series. Unfortunately, several events befell me recently that prevented me from finishing this book in a timely manner. These events include, but are not limited to: abduction by the Demon Lords of the Abyss, foiling a Shadowfell incursion, going undercover into duergar society, investigating a spree of curious star spawn appearances, and a rather eventful tea time with a close acquaintance.
> 
> But the important thing is that the book is here now, and I must say that it is some of my finest work. Not only have I covered the gamut of newly discovered creatures to harvest, but my travels have brought me into contact with ancient artefacts, more people that need harvesting help, and several new schools of combat and magic that incorporate our venerable art into their practices.
> 
> I implore you to enjoy this labor of love, dear reader. The knowledge in this book has been compiled under very trying circumstances, but it is all worth it in the pursuit of furthering our beloved craft. Inside, you will learn how to strip a skulk, melt down a marut, and hollow out a howler! Learn how to craft the spoils of your hunts into powerful weapons, channel the power of fiend lords into artefacts, and even find how to incorporate harvesting into every aspect of your being. Ours is an ever-expanding field, and I am so incredibly grateful to be with you every step of the way.

> Good luck and good harvesting,

Well, without getting too far into it, I will mention that I have become very interested in herbalism ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Herbalism Handbook.json] as of late...

## Aim of this Guide

Thank you for purchasing the third instalment of the "Hamund's Harvesting Handbook" series. This volume covers the monsters included in "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes", and as before, features a complete harvesting list for each monster, as well as over 130 new magical items to craft. The rules for harvesting and crafting are unchanged, but this book once again adds several new harvesting related rules to incorporate into your game. Premiering in this book is artifact crafting, a new harvesting related subclass for all 12 original player classes, and instructions for incorporating artificers into these harvesting rules. Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course feel free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at *driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com* or hit me up on Twitter @drifterworkshop (https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop) to discuss anything in this guide.
