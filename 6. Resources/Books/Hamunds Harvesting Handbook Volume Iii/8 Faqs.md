# FAQs
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III, p. 137* 

*Q: Why didn't you include the meat you can harvest from creatures?*

A: I wanted to avoid relatively generic harvesting materials. Largely I assumed that DM's would be able to judge meat harvesting by themselves without any need for a guide.

*Q: Can I give suggestions or feedback?*

A: Of course! This is a living document and I fully endorse anyone to send in item suggestions or balance feedback. See the Contact Us section for contact details.

*Q: Can I change an item to suit my campaign?*

A: Feel free to do so. Items were designed to be setting agnostic and able to fit into anything, but edge cases could always occur. I encourage DMs to use this guide as a launching point for their own ideas.

*Q: What's your next book, considering there's no more monster compendiums by WotC?*

A: Well first I'm going to take a bit of a break. I might publish a few adventures I've written, but after that, I will probably look into a herbalism guide. Follow @drifterworkshop (https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop) on Twitter for regular updates.

*Q: Why don't you include the beast section?*

A: I felt that beasts were too mundane to include in the harvest table, and largely could be replaced by a DM googling an actual butcher table.

*Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armor?*

A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every Hobgoblin walks around with a spear at all times, so I felt best to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context.
