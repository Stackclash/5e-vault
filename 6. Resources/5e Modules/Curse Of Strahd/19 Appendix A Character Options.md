## Character Background

During character creation, players can select the following background for their characters, with your approval: [[5. Mechanics/Backgrounds/Haunted One (VRGR).md|Haunted One]]. It is appropriate for any character or campaign associated with eeriness or horror.

## Gothic Trinkets

When rolling for a trinket, consider using the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Trinket (COS).md|Gothic Trinkets table]], which is designed for a gothic game.
