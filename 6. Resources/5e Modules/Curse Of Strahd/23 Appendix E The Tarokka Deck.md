# Appendix E: The Tarokka Deck
*Source: Curse of Strahd, p. 243* 

The Vistani have long been masters of fortune-telling. In the hands of a Vistani seer, a [[5. Mechanics/Decks/Tarokka Deck (COS).md\|deck of tarokka cards]] can tell tales of the future and provide answers to many a dark and mysterious question.

Although the workmanship and artistic quality of the cards can vary from deck to deck, the ability of the cards to call forth information about the future is far more valuable than the monetary worth of a deck.

Anyone can craft a [[5. Mechanics/Decks/Tarokka Deck (COS).md\|deck of tarokka cards]], but only someone of Vistani blood can imbue the cards with the gift of prophecy. Once they are crafted and empowered, they must be stored in accordance with ancient tradition, or they lose their efficacy. When not in use, tarokka cards must be wrapped in silk and stored in a wooden box.

## Composition

A [[5. Mechanics/Decks/Tarokka Deck (COS).md\|tarokka deck]] has fifty-four cards, each of which has its own name. Forty of them comprise the common deck, which is divided into four suits: swords, coins, stars, and glyphs.

Each suit contains cards numbered one through nine, plus a tenth card that is called the master of that suit. A card can be referred to by its suit designation or by its name. For instance, the three of glyphs is also known as the [[5. Mechanics/Decks/Tarokka Deck (COS).md#healer\|healer]], and the [[5. Mechanics/Decks/Tarokka Deck (COS).md#wizard\|wizard]] card is also known as the master of stars.

The remaining fourteen cards make up the high deck, which symbolizes the natural forces of the multiverse. These cards are represented by a crown symbol and are the most powerful cards in the deck.

## High Deck

The cards that compose the high deck aren't considered to be one suit, although they are often denoted with a crown icon to mark their importance. Rather, each card is an important power in its own right. If one of these cards comes out in a casting and seems to contradict the prediction of an earlier card, the Vistani always assume that this card takes precedence.
