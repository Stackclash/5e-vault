# The Siege of Castle Rend
*Source: The Siege of Castle Rend* 

The Siege of Castle Rend is an adventure for the fifth edition of the world's first roleplaying game, suitable for five 5th-level characters. It takes place over four parts, and each part can be completed in one or two sessions of play, depending on your group's playstyle and how long you like to play in a single sitting. If all goes according to plan over the course of this adventure, the player characters will expose an usurping lord, fight orcs, acquire a stronghold, defend it from an invading army, win the admiration of a town filled with potential vassals, and make political connections within the Barony of Bedegar.

Of course, no adventure goes according to plan. The PCs will invariably throw these well-laid schemes into chaos, and they'll have to improvise. But if we know how things would have gone if the PCs never showed up (or are cowards), it makes it easier for us GMs to improvise when things go off the rails.

## Notes on This Adventure

One of our stretch goals was an adventure using these rules...and this is it! Some of you may be familiar with it if you've watched my original campaign diaries. They basically begin right before the action in this adventure. There are several ways to get a stronghold: a local noble awards one, you buy one, orâ€”perhaps the most common: you clear out a ruin and say, "Let's make this our base!" So we use this adventure to show off arguably the most complex iteration of these rules: The players clear out a castle infested with orcs, become embroiled in the local political landscape, and must decide how they're going to use their new stronghold. (Is it a castle with a keep, tower, and temple inside? Or just a huge keep? Not an insignificant question when an enemy army is bearing down on you!)

I wrote the outline for this adventure and had already run it two or three times in my own games, but to minimize the impact on our production schedule, I asked James Haeck to write it. So what you're about to read is a combination of my outline and his ideas. He took Pinna from being a one-line description to one of my favorite NPCs! I can't wait to run her the next time I deploy this adventure. ðŸ˜ƒ

So thanks to James for the writing and design, thanks to everyone who backed the project and helped us reach the stretch goal for this adventure, and thanks to you reading this now for supporting the work!

### The Mundane World

We could have set this adventure in an entirely generic world, and I'm sure some readers would have preferred that, but enough folks seem to like my setting that I decided to use it. It should be generic enough for most purposes.

This adventure is set in a region of Vasloria (my analog to medieval Europe) called Aendrim. Its map would show you a series of far-flung baronies connected by disused roads, surrounded by hazardous wilderness. This is my version of the ur-fantasy campaign where low-level characters need to worry about just getting around. Bandits and goblins abound!

Obviously there's oodles of nonsense we call "lore" I could inflict upon you, but really all you need to know is that the local towns and villages look to the local baron to provide security. The barons are the only civilized power in the land now, and some of them are...not primarily concerned with the welfare of their citizens.

## Preparing This Adventure

Before running this adventure, you'll need the three 5E core rulebooks. If you don't have copies of them, you can also find the basic rules for free online. Whenever the text in this book refers to a statblock for a creature or NPC, its name is written in **bold text**. Most monsters can be found in the 5E basic rules, but creatures unique to this adventure are found starting on page 135. Likewise, whenever this book gives the name of a magic item in *italicized text*, that indicates the creature has statistics found in either the basic rules or in Magic Items (page 146).

Before running this adventure, you should also familiarize yourself with the major NPCs and their factions. This will help you improvise when the players do something you don't expect.

> [!note] Player Engagement
> 
> This adventure is a story of faction warfare and political maneuvering that may ultimately bestow upon the PCs a noble title and their own stronghold. Not all players care about this stuff. For your sake and theirs, talk to your players and get a sense of how interested they are in a campaign that involves politics, intrigue, commanding armies, and maintaining a keep or castle. As long as some of them are interested in this whole stronghold thing, you should be safe. There's still plenty of dungeon-exploring and orc-slaying in this adventure, after all.

## Adventure Summary

This adventure begins with the arrival of Sir Pelliton in the Reluctant Pig, Gravesford's tavern. The PCs may be there for various reasons:

- They are returning to civilization after recovering a magic item from a dungeon in the wilderness. One of them heard of a hedge mage named Pinna in a nearby village that can identify magical relics.  
- Gravesford is a fine starting town! You could begin a campaign here so that when the players reach 5th level they are well known to the locals. Or the PCs could decamp to Gravesford at any point between 1st and 5th levels.  
- They come to a crossroads while traveling along a major roadway in Bedegar. Nailed to the sign is a broadsheet declaring, "FRESH POTIONS FOR ALL AILS, VISIT PINNA'S SHOP IN GRAVESFORD. (WIZARDS WELCOME TO COMPARE NOTES AND EXCHANGE KNOWLEDGE.)"  
- An important wizardly NPC asks the party to deliver a package to Pinna: a monthly shipment of minor arcane supplies she can't get locally, along with a nice payment for their troubles. They meet Pinna and retire to the Reluctant Pig for the first hot meal they've had in days when Sir Pelliton and his flunkies kick open the door. Run the Arrival of Sir Pelliton event (page 110).

### Part 1: The Village of Gravesford

This adventure begins as the heroes arrive in Gravesford or *in medias res* as they awake in the Reluctant Pig, Gravesford's tavern. They will meet both friends and foes in town, such as the eager hedge mage Pinna and the callous Star Knight, Sir Pelliton of the Knights of the Three Roses.

The action begins when orcs of the White Tusk clan from the nearby forest attack Pinna's shop under cover of night and spirit her away ^[Unless the players manage to stop them!] for unknown reasons. The characters must pursue the kidnappers and rescue the village's beloved mage.

### Part 2: The Forest Rend

The orcs' tracks are easy to follow, but the Forest Rend is dark and dangerous. The PCs may conquer the forest using stealth or steel as they track the orcs back to their hideaway. This part concludes when the characters reach the ruins of Castle Rend, an ancient stronghold that the White Tusk orcs turned into a temporary headquarters.

### Part 3: The Ruins of Castle Rend

Having tracked down the White Tusk orcs, the PCs must now infiltrate their stronghold and save Pinna. While exploring the stronghold, they encounter warlike orcs and the restless spirits of the knights that once held the keep, and they learn that Pinna is not the only captive of the White Tusks. A young nobleman named Edmund, son of the dead baron and lost heir to the throne of Bedegar, is being held in relative comfort as a political prisoner.

If they play their cards right, the PCs can negotiate with Bonebreaker Dorokor, the orcs' leader, and rescue Pinna and Edmund without a fight. They may even claim ownership of Castle Rend, gaining a stronghold of their own in the process. If negotiations break down, however, they must fight for their lives and take the castle by force.

### Part 4: The Siege of Castle Rend

Hunting the White Tusk orcs, and warned that the PCs are hunting the orcs as well, Sir Pelliton brings Lord Saxton's army to Castle Rend prepared for a siege, unaware the PCs already claimed it. If the characters wish to keep their newly won stronghold, they must defend it and defeat Sir Pelliton and his army.

### Conclusion

Having defeated (or parleyed with) the White Tusk orcs and humiliated (or killed!) Sir Pelliton, the PCs return to Gravesford as heroes. The extent to which the people of Gravesford celebrate the PCs' victory depends on how successful they were in their battles, negotiations, and rescue attempts throughout this adventure. Will the characters be remembered as great heroes? Or will they go down in infamy as rogues and scoundrels?

## Major NPCs

These are the important characters in this adventure. They each have their own personality traits, bonds, ideals, and flaws that inform their actions throughout this story.

As the GM, you are empowered to change anything about them, including their race and statistics, to better fit your campaign setting or challenge your party.

It should be relatively straightforward to stick this adventure in your own campaign. Here are the broad features you should think about:

- Someone important and well-liked is dead. [The Baron of Bedegar]  
- He and his family were killed by a tribe of orcs or other humanoids.  
- A power-hungry villain has taken their place. [Lord Saxton]  
- The orcs who killed the baron were secretly in the pay of the usurper.  
- The leader of the clan secretly took a hostage that could undo the villain's scheme. [Edmund Bedegar]  
- The villain's despised lieutenant antagonizes the player characters. [Sir Pelliton]  

### Lord Saxton

The characters never meet Lord Saxton, the power-hungry lord marshall and regent of Bedegar, in this adventure. However, many NPCs in this adventure obey him, despise him, or are otherwise bound to him.

Shortly before the events of this adventure, Lord Saxton conspired with Bonebreaker Dorokor, leader of the White Tusk orc clan, to kill the Baron of Bedegar and his family. In return, Dorokor would receive an ancient orc talisman, kept by the Bedegar family as a trophy in their crypts.

Now the Bedegars are dead and Saxton sits on the throne of Bedegar Keep, where he is free to impose his tyrannical (and human-supremacist) will upon the people. The common folk of Bedegar are ambivalent to Saxton, but they revile his elite servants, the sadistic Knights of the Three Roses.

One of Saxton's first acts as regent was to double-cross his orcish pawns. When Bonebreaker Dorokor sent a scout to claim the promised artifact, Saxton killed the orc emissary and sent his knights across the countryside, nailing death warrants for Bonebreaker Dorokor and her White Tusk orcs in every tavern in every village they came across.

#### Motivation:

Lord Saxton envied his friend, the old baron, and felt he was better suited to rule. His lust for power turned him into a traitor long ago. He enjoys pitting the people of Bedegar against their humanoid neighbors, reveling in atrocity as long as the victims aren't humans. Thus does he tighten his iron grip on the people of Bedegar.

### Sir Pelliton

The despotic will of Lord Saxton is made manifest by the Knights of the Three Roses. There are five of them, but Sir Pelliton, the Star Knight, is the only one who features in this adventure.

Pelliton is despised by the people of Bedegar, and for good reason. The Star Knight ^[In any order of knights, the knights take their own unique titles to pass on. Sir Pelliton took his from the constellation of the Tower, long a symbol of tyrannical strength.] is an authoritarian strongman who hides his true cowardice behind a smoke screen of noble status and the power of his superior, Lord Saxton. He also possesses unholy powers thanks to a supernatural bargain he forged with a dark spirit. He is well known in Gravesford as a petty tyrant who's used to taking what he wants, daring anyone to defy him.

Pelliton takes great pleasure in making other people fear and hate him, and whenever someone lashes out in anger, he strikes them down with sadistic glee. He rarely kills his victims, instead preferring to leave them covered with scars and just alive enough to grow his legendary infamy.

Pelliton is tall and thin, but muscular, with an imposing suit of armor emblazoned with the three-flowered symbol of the Knights of the Three Roses. His shield bears the five-starred constellation he took his title from. His skin is distressingly pale, and his shining shaved head and pitch-black goatee can be spotted from a mile off on a clear day.

#### Motivation:

Sir Pelliton makes himself feel powerful by making others suffer ^[The original anti-paladin was described as a knight of capricious cruelty and sneering brutality, and I quite like that image.]. He also wants to curry Lord Saxton's favor to ensure himself higher station and greater rewards in Saxton's regime.

### Bonebreaker Dorokor

Bonebreaker Dorokor commands the unquestioning loyalty of the White Tusk orc clan. She stands nearly seven feet tall and lifts her wicked greataxe, [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wound.md\|Wound]], with ease. Her clan respects her leadership as well as her might. Dorokor is a crafty and strategic warrior. Her plots and schemes are sophisticatedâ€”her bargain with Lord Saxton is the first one to backfire, causing her people to question her leadership a little. But her people believe that taking young Edmund, the baron's son, hostage is a feat that shows she thinks much farther ahead than a normal orc.

Her fanatical devotion to Grole ^[The god of the orcs in my world.] is both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness. Her zeal for Grole has driven her to become strong and self-sufficient, but it has also made her exploitable. Lord Saxton manipulated her into slaughtering the Baron of Bedegar and his family by promising her the Sanguineous Oriflamme ^[This is an orcish battle standard that, when drenched in the blood of a particular enemy, grants all orcs within 60 feet bonuses against that enemy. Its stats are not detailed herein, but it burns red like a flare while slaked with blood.], an artifact of Grole that the old baron's forebears took from the orcs decades ago.

Dorokor could not resist Saxton's offer. She accepted the deal and mustered her tribe. Saxton's men opened the gates of Bedegar Keep and the White Tusk orcs stormed in, mercilessly slaughtering all withinâ€”except one young boy. Dorokor was no fool and could sense that Saxton was a snake. She spared the life of young Edmund Bedegar and spirited him away to Castle Rend, the derelict fortress that the White Tusk orcs call home. She is keeping the young lordling as insurance against Lord Saxton's treachery. She believesâ€”and she is correctâ€”that if she produces the boy at the right place and time, the humans will rebel against the usurper Saxton. She doesn't particularly care who rules, she just wants the Oriflamme.

Despite her cunning, Dorokor knows little of the ways of human diplomacy. She assumes that humans are weak and, should you capture one, they will give up much to recover them. During the adventure, she initiates negotiations in the same way that Saxton dealt with her: she kidnaps a young woman from the nearby town of Gravesford and will only release her if they agree to parley. She reacts with confusion and hostility if the heroes arrive at her keep and attack. Dorokor's Common is simple but fluent. When speaking in Orc, however, she uses grandiose and often poetic turns of phrase.

#### Motivation:

Bonebreaker Dorokor wants to see her clan triumph over all others, including Men and elves. She has ambition beyond any normal bloodchief. She also seeks to honor Grole with glorious victories in combat and is often torn between her desire to protect her clan and her hunger for war.

#### Roleplaying Dorokor

Alone among the local orcs, Dorokor is developing a growing mastery over realpolitik. She knows how to navigate treacherous waters. In one sense, no other orc bloodchief could have gotten themselves into this problem, but no other bloodchief would think of kidnapping one lone child of the royal family to use as hostage, and no other bloodchief would parley with the heroes.

Dorokor is smart, and she wants to *win*. But victory, for her, means reclaiming the Sanguineous Oriflamme. Here are some examples of her speech:

> "Men are weak. Needing laws and paper to rule, this is why you fail, your towns diminish. Orcs care only for strength, and thus does our tribe increase and our power grow."

> "You have killed many of my tribe to get here. And you think yourself ready to kill us all to get what you want. You may win. I know this. But you are surrounded and in my territory. And it will cost you dearly, cost you in *blood*, to get out again. Unless..."

> "We can talk. I will talk to you. But words mean nothing without deeds. You wish this boy? You wish my aid? You must give something to *me*. Not a promise, not words. A thing. A thing of power."

> "Oh they cannot understand us. Among the White Tusk, only Oregg and I speak your tongue. I have studied my enemy well. We are not so different. You must return to your people with something to show them you are strong, that you triumphed over us. Very well. So be it. I know the ways of the world. But so too must I show my people I triumphed over *you*. Your people will accept paper, 'tree-tees.' Promises. My people are not so easily *fooled*."

### Pinna

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/socr-pinna.jpg#center)

Pinna is a young woman of seventeen who lives in the village of Gravesford, at the edge of the Forest Rend. She is easily recognizable by her tall, pointed straw hat, curly red hair, and crystal necklaceâ€”her arcane focus. Pinna is a country hedge mage, well respected by the people of Gravesford. She often entertains children at festivals and market days by conjuring motes of flame or bouquets of flowers, and she helps the adults in town by supplying them with sleeping tonics and preventatives.

Pinna is a clever womanâ€”one of the few literate people in townâ€”but she feels inadequate compared to her absent master, a wizard named Tace who travels from town to town, tutoring many apprentices just like her across the land. He only comes by once every month or so to judge her progress and give her another tome of theory to read.

Despite Pinna's self-doubt, she is beloved by the townsfolk, who are simply happy to have a real wizard in their midst! Perhaps that is why the White Tusk orcs plan to kidnap her and force a parley with the village...

#### Motivation:

Pinna wants to be respected by someone with high standards. She loves the village folk, but they are overawed by any little display of magic.

### Edmund Bedegar

Edmund Bedegar is thirteen years old and the last of the Bedegar line. He is small and his voice is still cracking and peaking, but a perceptive person can see in his eyes the steely resolve of a confident ruler.

Edmund's older brother was to be the next baron, but as is traditional Edmund trained next to his brother in all things. He learned falconry, jousting, how to host a dinner, the proper ways to address a duke, a king, a count, or another baron. He idolized his older brother and expected to serve as his squire this next year, and then become chancellor of his court once his brother ascended to the barony. That was before the White Tusk came.

Now, Edmund is the rightful Baron of Bedegar by birthright, and he knows it. This is a tragedy, something he never wanted. And though he cries at night for his dead family, he staves off despair by focusing on his commitment to upholding the family name, and becoming the leader he knows his family would want. He intends to honor his father and brother, his mother and sisters by ruling where they cannot. This is the steel inside young Edmund.

He knows his station and expects to be treated with the respect his title deserves, but he is not a petulant child. He is a young lord with a kind heart and an ingrained sense of justice. He rightfully fears the orcs that kidnapped him, every night remembering his family dying under their axes.

He continually reminds himself, *I am Baron now, what would my father do?* The health of the barony must come first. And Dorokor would make as powerful an ally as she has an enemy. He wants revenge, but not as much as he wants to be the kind of savvy ruler his father was. When he discovers that his father's friend, Lord Saxton, is the architect of the night his family died, he may set his hatred of the orcs aside and turn his ire upon the true mastermind.

#### Motivation:

Edmund wants to avenge the death of his family by executing their murderer. At the start of this adventure, he believes this to be Bonebreaker Dorokor, but his ire could be turned to Lord Saxton if the truth were revealed to him. He also wants to return to Bedegar Keep so that he may give his family a proper funeral.
