# Part 2: The Forest Rend

> "The Mundane World lies between Axiom and Primordius, planes of uttermost law and chaos. Philosophers believe our world is a mirror of those two diametrically opposed realms. They describe law and chaos as "leaking" into our world like water through a poorly sealed bladder. But this ignores a fundamental truth: Axiom and Primordius are at war, and our world lies between. These forces do not exist here because of a mere quirk of geometry. They are here because our world is their battlefield."

The Forest Rend once protected the people of Bedegar. It supplied wood for their houses and hearths, food for their bellies, and, most importantly, protection from both monsters and invaders. Over a century ago, Good King Omund's Blue Dragon Phalanx built one of their many fortresses in this forest.

Then Ajax, called Invincible, slew Omund and routed his incorruptible knights. Now the Forest Rend, home to all manner of fell beastie, is an existential threat to Gravesford and Bedegar. The ruins of Castle Rend, a name now forgotten to the people of Gravesford, are occupied by the White Tusk orcs.

The characters must track the orcs through the forest if they are to find their stronghold and rescue Pinna. This forest exploration should be quick, but long enough to show that this forest is deep, dark, and not to be trifled with. If they wish to make this forest less dangerous, they will have the power to do soâ€”once they have their stronghold! ^[The forthcoming *Kingdoms & Warfare* will have rules for civilizing wilderness. And wilding civilization!]

## Exploring the Forest

If the PCs wish to find Castle Rend, they must track the White Tusk orcs, following the trail they left behind when fleeing Gravesford. The tracks are easy to find, and following them carefully will help the characters avoid encounters with dangerous creatures within the forest. It would normally take a day or more to find Castle Rend, but because the PCs are following the orc trail, the journey takes about 3 hours. **At the end of each hour spent traveling, one character must make a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check at DC 10 for the first hour of travel, DC 13 for the second hour, and DC 15 for the third.** The forest gets thicker as they progress.

If the tracker fails a check, roll on the Forest Rend Encounters chart below, or use one of the pre-rolled encounters below. If the check failed by 5 or more, the encountered creatures ambush the party, gaining a round of surprise at the start of combat.

The characters find Castle Rend once their tracker makes three Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks, regardless of success or failure.

### Encounter 1: Hungry Beasts

In the light undergrowth at the edge of the Forest Rend, 2 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Ankheg.md\|ankhegs]] messily devour the remains of a White Tusk scout. Its burrowing disturbed a nest of giant insects, and 6 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Centipede.md\|giant centipedes]] are lurking in tunnels beneath the ground waiting to feast on whatever the ankhegs leave behind. They emerge whenever the ankheg burrows back underground, and they attack the first medium or smaller creatures they see on the surface.

Whoever is tracking the orcs must make a DC 10 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check. On a failure, they do not notice the mounds of unearthed soil dotting the area or the ankhegs devouring an orc's corpse in the undergrowth, and the ankhegs get a surprise round in combat when they ambush the PCs. After they attack on their surprise round, they burrow into the earth, causing the 6 giant centipedes to rise to the surface on their next turn. On a successful check, the tracker notices the ankhegs first. If the PCs wish to sneak past them, they only need to make a successful DC 6 Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) check to avoid attracting the distracted ankhegs' attention.

### Encounter 2: Devouring Wilderness

Deeper in the forest, the constricting trees choke out light until the bright day turns to dim twilight, and no illumination penetrates the forest during nighttime. In this oppressive darkness, a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Shambling Mound.md\|shambling mound]] lurks motionless, ready to devour any creature that steps into its rotting, shapeless body. The only sign that this mound is not what it appears to be are the orc bones jutting out of its mulchy exterior.

Whoever is tracking the orcs must make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check. On a failure, they do not notice the signs of combat from the hapless orcs who died here to the slow, shambling attacker. They wander directly into the shambling mound. It gains a surprise round in combat, which it uses to attack and engulf the tracker. On a successful check, the tracker spots the orc bones protruding from the mound and sees the signs of chaos surrounding it before getting within 60 feet of the mound. If the PCs do not disturb the shambling mound, it does not pursue them.

### Encounter 3: White Tusk Sentries

The branches of the forest grow thinner, light breaks through the canopy, and the faint chirping of cicadas covers the forest like an aural blanket. The orc tracks here are dense; this area has been heavily trafficked in recent months. As the tracker studies the path to discern the correct way forward, the cicadas are silenced by the snarling of dogs and the plodding of metal boots. A pair of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Bloodrager (SAF).md\|White Tusk bloodragers]] and their 2 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Dire Wolf.md\|dire wolf]] hunting dogs patrol this area.

Whoever is tracking the orcs must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check. On a failed check, the dire wolves catch the characters' scent, and the sentries pursue them with intent to kill for up to 1 mile. On a successful check, the tracker finds a path through the underbrush that helps them conceal their tracks and scent, letting them slip past the sentries. On a failure, the orcs immediately catch up and attack. If any of the orcs are captured and interrogated, a successful DC 14 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) check forces one to reveal the existance of a second human captive, though they aren't super clear on who exactly "the little one" is or why he's important. They unquestioningly believe he *is* important because the bloodchief says so.

After this encounter, the characters find their way to the edge of a forest clearing. Through the thinning tree line, they can see the ancient walls and crumbling crenellations of an ancient fortress. Tall torches burn at the edges of the clearing, illuminating the grounds for the benefit of the orcs standing atop the battlements.
