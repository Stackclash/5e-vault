# Part 1: The Village of Gravesford
*Source: The Siege of Castle Rend, p. 104* 

> [!quote] A quote from   
> 
> "We have discussed the design and function of the interlocking, interdependent parts of the machine; a system under pressure, whether a coiled spring, a rope pulled taut, or a pressurized fluid. Our Ideal Machine's functions depend on this pressure, while simultaneously, constantly, this same pressure threatens to cause everything to fly out of control. Are we not also talking about the State? Society? Even a village? What would we learn, should we take the principles of this book and apply them to a nation?"

Gravesford is a village situated at the edge of civilizationâ€”as far as the Barony of Bedegar is concerned, at least. There's been a bridge across the River Graves, and a town around that, for as long as anyone can remember and as far back as any records go. Folks know, or believe, that the bridge and the Reluctant Pig existed long before any other house in Gravesford, even the church, was built.

As in any countryside town, everyone in Gravesford knows everyone else, and word is quick to spread. If newcomersâ€”like the PCsâ€”arrive in town and spend the night in the local inn, odds are the entire population of two-hundred-odd villagers including nearby farmers will know by mid-morning. The town's two public buildings, the Reluctant Pig and the Church of St. Gaed the Confessor, are large enough for the entire town to crowd into for major celebrations like the harvest-tide feast and candle festival of St. Gaed's Feast.

## Gravesford NPCs

### Mayor Osric

Cheesewright and baker, owner of the stables and the general store. Osric is in his early fifties, rotund, and fancies himself a captain of industry. He'd like to see Gravesford grow and to become famous for something noteworthy, and sometimes lets these ambitions carry him away. But he is a good man who, when times are hard, cares more for his neighbors than his reputation.

### Ostler ^["Ostler" isn't his name, it's a title. A job. It means...the dude who runs the stables. ðŸ˜ƒ Now archaic, but part of the fun of the game is learning these things.] Hamm

A tall thin man who runs the stables for Osric. Is reluctant to sell or lend his horses to anyone he doesn't know. Usually relies on Osric to make the call when strangers need a horse.

### Millicent and Belle

Two sisters in their early thirties who run the store for Osric. Millicent is married to a farmer in the country and is generally a fusspot who wants to make sure customers are well supplied with anything they might need and perhaps one or two things they don't. Belle is happily unmarried and enjoys negotiating with the local carters to make sure the store is well stocked.

### Jago the Smith

His smithy is a popular hangout for the men of the town who'd like a spot of ale without having to listen to the farmers relaxing in the inn. Jago has long black hair and enjoys talkingâ€”he's always telling a story about the most recent weirdos who passed through looking for someone to straighten a sword or pound out the dents in their armor.

### Morgouse the Carpenter

She was once Morgouse the Weaver until her husband died and she decided to take over the family business. Soft-spoken and industrious, she sees the wooden shops and houses as basically just another kind of fabric, and she can often be found on a roof, or step ladder, repairing water damage or rot without anyone having asked her or her asking payment.

### Giselle and Gowan

Owners of the Reluctant Pig. Gowan cooks, Giselle runs the bar, and their thirteenyear-old daughter Brecca takes orders and serves drinks and food. Brecca spends her limited free time learning weaving from Morgouse and hopes to set up her own shop before she's fifteen.

The town council is technically Osric, Jago, Morgouse, Giselle, and a farmer named Carroc (see later). Carroc is an ass and lives on his farm, so the others conspire to meet and decide things when they know he'll be busy. Millicent, Belle, and Hamm are villeins ^[Like a serf but has more rights.] of the Baron and have no legal rights to their shops or land, but folks in town tend to forget this, so they're always part of any decision. Gowan can't be arsed to worry about local politicsâ€”he's got fowl to braise.

The town has no local law enforcement, but folk do well enough without it; they have a volunteer militia that assembles when ordered by the town council. They pay their taxes to the Baron of Bedegar (or, more recently, to the realm's regent, Lord Saxton) and gain the benefits of trade and roadways that all citizens of Bedegar enjoy. Otherwise, they are a community small enough to take care of themselves.

Gravesford is at the edge of the Forest Rend, a lawless wood where inhuman creatures roam. None dare go deeper into the forest than is necessary to hunt game or chop wood. Legends say that orcs and goblins and other nasty bogeymen lurk in the forest, and that is enough to keep people away.

> [!note] Tracking Time in Gravesford
> 
> Time matters in Gravesford. At midnight on the first day, the White Tusk orcs raid the young mage Pinna's shop and attempt to kidnap the hedge mage. If the characters dally, Dorokor returns two days later demanding to parley. Since the PCs only have one day to meet Pinna, it's strongly recommended to give them a chance to encounter her before the orcs raid her shop and attempt to kidnap her.

## Gravesford Locations

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/socr-gravesford.jpg#center)

The small town of Gravesford is filled with common people and their homes. Some of these homes and shops may be of interest to the players and are detailed here. To not overwhelm you with the minutiae of the homesteads of two hundred people, other locations are left blank for you to fill in as needed. These locations are keyed to the map of Gravesford found on the next page.

### A1. Farmhouses

About two dozen farmhouses surround Gravesford, each holding a family of five to ten people. Farmers, wives, husbands, children, grandparents, and parentsin-law all fill these houses, working the land as best they are able.

The largest farm in Gravesford is owned by a crass man named Carroc (use [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Noble.md\|noble]] statistics), is occupied by his wife and five boys, and is tended to during the day by a group of four servants who live in town. Carroc enjoys acting like he's the most important person in town, and he may indeed be the most wealthy, but he doesn't live in town so the mayor and the rest of the town council tend to ignore him. He enjoys coming to the Pig for a drink once a week, but does not notice that the most important people in town all seem to be at the smith's when he's visiting.

Carroc is pious, tithing more than ten percent each season to the Church of St. Gaed. While Mayor Osric hopes to see Gravesford grow from a hamlet into a proper town, maybe with a wall someday, Carroc hopes to be a landed noble, and looks down on the rest of the town. He has no love for adventurers, as they represent a threat to the natural order of the town. He looks up to the cruel Sir Pelliton and would do anything to become his aideâ€”or to become a knight just like him.

His personal hoard of 500 gp is squirreled away in a locked wooden box hidden beneath the floorboards under his bed. The box can be unlocked with a key kept on Carroc's person, or its lock can be picked with a DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

Other farmers are more sympathetic than "Duke Carroc," as folk might grumble while drinking at the tavern. One farmer in particular, a sun-baked and calloused grandmother named Helanna, is quite fond of adventurers and their stories of danger and distant lands. She doesn't have the money or social power that Carroc's family wields, but she is beloved by all the common folk in Gravesford.

### A2. Market Square

In the center of Gravesford is a market square. Most of the week, the square is empty except perhaps for children running about with sticks, pretending to be knights. The PCs, however, arrive in Gravesford on market day. Once a fortnight on this day, the square is transformed into a wild scene of colors and scents. All the artisans and farmers in townâ€”including Jago and Morgouse, and the town's tanners and leatherworkers, woodworkers, stonemasons, millers, bakers, butchers, and othersâ€”set up shop in the market square and sell their wares. Just outside of the main market square is Tradesfolks' Way, a small alley where local farmers trade goods to one another. **Any item in the core rulebooks worth less than 10 gp can be purchased from the traders at the Gravesford market.**

Pinna also sets up a stall in the market square, but she is usually too busy conjuring bouquets and playing with the children to actually sell any goods. A sign sits on her (completely unstocked) stall that reads: "OUT PLAYING, FIND ME. LOOK FOR THE HAT. OTHERWISE VISIT THE SHOP AFTER MARKET."

### A3. Church of St. Gaed the Confessor

The Church of St. Gaed the Confessor is one of the oldest buildings in Gravesfordâ€”after the Reluctant Pig, of course. Its wooden beams need repair, but it is still the cultural center of the village, and Gravesford gathers here for all sorts of occasions, not just on holy days. The stained glass window depicting Saint Gaed in black armor smiting the traitor saint, Hylae the Corrupt, is the most astonishing piece of art anyone in town has ever seen. When the sun hits it, it's like a laser light show.

The church is run by Father Belderone, a priest of St. Gaed. He is a city man from Bedegar Keep, and it's reflected in his rapid, matter-of-fact speech, but the villagers treat him as one of their own. While several priests tend to the church, Father Belderone is its only cleric. He uses [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Priest.md\|priest]] statistics with the following changes:

- He is old and growing frail. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores are all 8 (Father Belderone (`dice:1d20-1|noform|noparens|text(-1)`)).  
- He does not wear armor, reducing his AC to 9.  
- By the grace of St. Gaed the Confessor, he has been granted the ability to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Death Ward.md\|death ward]] once per day.  

If the PCs spend time at the church in prayer, Father Belderone approaches them and kindly welcomes them to Gravesford. He asks if they are planning on exploring the region, and offers to grant them a blessing of protection (his [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Death Ward.md\|death ward]]) for the journeyâ€”if they are able to donate 100 gp to the church, which is in serious need of repairs.

#### Followers of Saint Gaed

A local priest, like Father Belderone, will be primarily concerned with the people's welfare. Village healers tend not to be foaming fanatics spouting doctrine at everyone. That kind of attitude doesn't survive long when you're living elbow-to-elbow with real people.

So, Father Belderone is likely to spout a lot of folk wisdom first, then some general tenets of Cavall ("Man cannot live where injustice thrives."), then something specific from Saint Gaed only in extreme moments.

Followers of St. Gaed seek the truth hidden in people's hearts and are quick to find conspiracies, secret orders, and cults.

> [!readaloud] Quotes of Father Belderone
> 
> "The greatest lie is never spoken. It's the one you tell yourself to justify an evil deed."
> 
> "The path to redemption begins with a truth spoken."
> 
> "A burden shared is a burden halved."
^quotes-of-father-belderone

Based on the events of this adventure, it's unlikely Father Belderone is going to have to go Full-Knob Inquisition on anyoneâ€”he's not that kind of priest, but he is a follower of Saint Gaed, and does believe in the truth above all else.

> [!note] Gaed the Confessor
> 
> In my setting and novels, the people do not worship gods directly. Instead, they serve saints who act as interlocutors for the gods. Why this should be so is never explained, but the implication is that gods are ineffable and unknowable, and the saints are their once-mortal translators. Heroes in life, the saints died and joined their gods, who award the priests who serve them with special abilities.
> 
> Gaed is a saint of Cavall. Cavall is one of the two "good" gods in this part of the world, and can be easily replaced with any lawful good god from your world who is primarily concerned with justice. Saints, unlike gods, can and do show up in material form to aid their followers, but A: only the most pious followers, and B: only when in great need, unless C: the GM thinks it would be cool for them to show up anyway.
> 
> In life Gaed was the chief confessor in a secret order of knights who ferreted out spies within the king's court. Unbeknownst to anyone, the chief of those spies was a fiend, a devil under the command of an evil saint.
> 
> Gaed exposed this devil and did battle with it. He lost the battle and his life, but exposed a deadly conspiracy and saved the king and the kingdom. He forced the devil to reveal its true nature, and Cavall canonized him immediately as the Confessor, saint of exposing secrets and foiling conspiracies. It was Gaed who died at the hands of the devil spy. It was Saint Gaed the Confessor, now immortal, who returned and slew the devil.

### A4. The Reluctant Pig

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/socr-reluctant-pig.webp#center)

The oldest building in Gravesford is the Reluctant Pig, a two-story inn with a moss-covered roof constructed from the same stone as the Gravesford Bridge. The sign outside depicts a young pig straining against a leash held by someone we cannot see. The sign has no text, as most people in town and most carters and journeymen cannot read.

The Pig is owned by Giselle and Gowan and their daughter Brecca (page 104). Though the family divides the labor, Giselle is the one who runs the business and attends the meetings of the town council. She tolerates no violence in her bar, keeping a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]] by the taps in case of trouble. (She uses [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Veteran.md\|veteran]] statistics.) She is, however, terrified of Sir Pelliton and the Knights of the Three Roses, and will not interfere with any quarrel between them and her patrons. She personally knew the vile Star Knight back when his cadre were simply mercenaries known as the Thorns, and still bears the scars from their last two meetings. Her husband, Gowan, is torn between his desire to protect his wife and the sure knowledge that Sir Pelliton would kill him in a moment just to make a point. It is for this reason that Giselle has been careful not to confront Pelliton if her husband is around.

Brecca is good friends with the hedge mage Pinna, and often recommends her shop to travelers. If the PCs are running out of time to visit her before the first day ends (when her shop is attacked), you can have her show up in the tavern for one of her late-night chats with Brecca.

If the PCs stop in the tavern for more than just a few minutes, run The Arrival of Sir Pelliton (page 110). If the PCs spend the night here, run Abduction in the Dead of Night (page 111) at midnight.

### A5. Gravesford Bridge

The Gravesford Bridge is a small stone bridge over the river at the edge of town. It is old and moss-covered, but sturdy. Two guards stand at the far end of the bridge; they are well equipped for country folk, but they are not trained in the ways of war like adventurers or orcs are. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Guard.md\|guards]] are a man named Ryon and a woman named Lenore, and they are tasked with watching over the Forest Rend in case of emergency. The end of the bridge is separated from the forest's edge by about a thousand feet of tall grass, shrubs, and boulders.

If asked what sort of emergencies they're prepared to guard against, Ryon shrugs and says that there's never been any real trouble from the forest in his lifetime. Old Helanna told him and Lenore that the forest is a force of chaos threatening to destroy Bedegar, and that it's filled with evil creatures. Neither Ryon nor Lenore buy it; the worst they've seen come out of the forest is a wounded bear, and all it did was run past town, yowling.

### A6. Pinna's Shop

The spicy-sweet scent of boiled licorice and anise seed billows from the smokestack of Pinna's dome-roofed hut. Other medicinal herbs hang by the doorway, like long garlic ropes and branches of flowering barberry. Inside, she keeps a brass cauldron boiling at all times in the center of the room. Unkempt bookshelves overfilled with tomes, scrolls, and bottles line the walls, and both chairs in the house sag under the weight of unwashed clothing.

Pinna's shop is also her one-room house. While at home, Pinna is usually doing at least three things at onceâ€”brewing ointments, clipping shoots from herbs, and practicing charms, or any other combination of wizardly activities. She only stops multitasking if another wizard enters her shop, at which point she drops everything and focuses intently on them. Any compliment from a fellow magic-user overwhelms her with joy, reducing her to embarrassed babbling for a few moments, and any mean-spirited condescension utterly devastates her, causing her to close shop for the rest of the day.

Pinna sells dozens of rustic herbal remedies for 5 cp apiece and has four [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing.md\|potions of healing]], which she sells for 50 gp each. She also has the following potions in stock: a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Greater Healing.md\|potion of greater healing]] (200 gp), a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Animal Friendship.md\|potion of animal friendship]] (250 gp), and a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Poison Resistance.md\|potion of poison resistance]] (300 gp). Whenever she sells a potion, she waves her crystal necklace (her arcane focus) around the potion and mutters a meaningless incantation composed of rhyming doggerel. It's just a habit she picked up to impress the villagers, and she gets embarrassed if another spellcaster calls her on it.

At midnight on the first night after the PCs arrive in Gravesford, a force of White Tusk orcs emerges from the Forest Rend and attacks Pinna's shop under cover of night. Run the Abduction in the Dead of Night (page 111) event at midnight that night.

## Beginning: Arriving in Gravesford

Ideally the PCs arrive in Gravesford at dusk, seeking food, shelter, and rest. The following timeline describes the order in which events will occur unless the characters intervene:

- **The Arrival of Sir Pelliton (Day 1, Shortly after the Players Arrive)..** Sir Pelliton, an agent of Lord Saxton, posts a wanted poster in the Reluctant Pig and causes trouble with the PCs.  
- **Abduction in the Dead of Night (Day 1, Midnight)..** Orcs from the White Tusk clan abduct Pinna to begin "negotiations." The PCs may be able to stop them but will likely be delayed by the orcs' rear guard.  
- **Gravesford Rallies (Day 2, Morning)..** The citizens of Gravesford decide what to do about the attack and, unless the PCs intervene, elect to send a posse after Dorokor. They begin gathering supplies.  
- **The Posse Departs (Day 3, Morning)..** A handful of volunteers from around town set off to explore the Forest Rend. If they go off without a tracker, they do not return.  
- **Bonebreaker's Bargain (Day 4, Dawn)..** Bonebreaker Dorokor and her White Tusk orcs emerge from the forest, prepared to bargain for the life of Pinna, the militia, andâ€”most importantlyâ€”Edmund Bedegar.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/socr-bounty-post.webp#center)

### The Arrival of Sir Pelliton

There isn't much to do in Gravesfordâ€”it's an unremarkable townâ€”so Sir Pelliton should arrive shortly after the PCs settle in at the Reluctant Pig, kicking off the adventure.

> The door of the Reluctant Pig opens with a crash, and all heads inside the bar turn toward the entrance. A man in heavy armor stands in the doorframe, silhouetted and statuesque, a cloak hanging over his left shoulder, with his right hand grasping the pommel of his sheathed longsword. The knight strides in, with four armored warriors behind him, and surveys the taproom. A squire emerges from behind his cloak, unfurls a parchment, and declares, "Behold Sir Pelliton, Knight of Three Roses! The Star Knight bears a proclamation from your new lord: Saxton, Baron of Bedegar! ^["'Baron?' Hah!"â€”Some unfortunate farmer about to get a face full of mailed fist.] Your lord demands the head of Bonebreaker Dorokor and the White Tusk orcs, the lawless beasts that slaughtered the Baron of Bedegar and his family. The new baron promises the glory of a knighthood and five hundred gold marks to whosoever brings to him the head of the orcs' bloodchief."
> 
> Sir Pelliton points sharply to the wall of the tavern, and the squire scurries over to hammer the scroll to the wall, covering up several previous proclamations. The knight now personally strides forth into the taproom. His mouth curls into a venomous smirk. "Now that you have all been duly impressed, let me tell you dirt-eating, dung-bathing peasants one thing: None of you will be knighted and elevated to my station. I shall find these beasts and bring them to justice. I will be the one! And you will continue enjoying your joyless lives."
> 
> Pelliton's gaze falls upon you, and he saunters over to your table. Two of his flunkies follow him, while two remain at the door. He looks one of you dead in the eye and says, "Well how now? Ratcatchers with delusions of grandeur. How quaint. Come you seeking coin? I have some. If you would take it from me."

Without breaking eye contact with the PC he is intimidating, Sir Pelliton grabs their mug of ale, swigs what's left of it, and slams the empty mug on the table. "Remember your station, swineherd." He stands and makes to leave. If the PCs rise to his taunting, see Pelliton's Reprisal later. If the PCs let him go, Pelliton and his four knights linger in the tavern for ten unbearable minutes, verbally abusing peasants and "appropriating" their food and drink, then depart.

#### Proclamations

Sir Pelliton's proclamation was nailed over several older proclamations. The most recent was issued by Lord Saxton, and it declared that as lord marshall he would be assuming the duties of regent of Bedegar. Beneath that proclamation is another declaring that the Baron of Bedegar and all his known living relatives were slaughtered by orcs that had forced their way into Bedegar Keep. Even older proclamations beneath those are related to mundane issues of taxes and such.

#### Townsfolk

This is not the first time Sir Pelliton has boorishly cantered into Gravesford and thrown his weight around, and the people of this town have grown to hate and fear him. They all want him to get his comeuppance, but they do not challenge him because he possesses both dark magic and the protection of the regent, and he has used them both to kill with impunity. No one in town wishes to hunt the orcs because of Pelliton's involvement, and they look askance if the PCs suggest they wish to take on the challenge. One might say, "It's your funeral. Go stock up on potions with Pinna and rest up here. Hope you get to those orc-things before the Star Knight does, or before he finds you chasing after his bounty."

The townsfolk have no idea where the White Tusk orcs live. But they're not stupid, there's really only one place the orcs could be: Forest Rend. "If you're looking for orcs, odds are they've moved into the old forest. Legends say it's always been full of goblins and such. That's why we have two sentries posted on the other side of the bridge these days."

#### Pelliton's Reprisal

Introducing Pelliton (page 142) like this is literally inviting a fight, and the players will want to smite the dude. He's pretty nasty, though. With his flunkies, they should be too much for the players at 5th level. But he won't kill themâ€”he prefers leaving people defeated and cowed so they will spread tales of his prowess and increase his legend.

**Of course it is entirely possible that the PCs kill Pelliton.** If they do, just replace him in the hunt and this adventure by one of the other Knights of the Three Roses: Lady Ruth, Lady Morgant, Sir Noth, Sir Anglim, or Sir Barlow. Each of whom is now out for revenge!

Pelliton lives to inflict pain on others, and is always spoiling for a fight. If he is attacked or insulted, he laughs uproariously and shouts for his flunkies (four [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Veteran.md\|veterans]] and his squire) to join him: "If you wish to nip at my heels, *dogs*, I shall be happy to discipline you. Servants, to me!"

All bystanders in the bar stand when Pelliton draws his sword, and all run for cover when Pelliton casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Evards Black Tentacles.md\|black tentacles]] on his first turn in combat. His underlings attack the PCs, starting with any [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by Pelliton's magic. Once the PCs are subdued (or surrender) Pelliton sheathes his sword, spits on the ground, and leaves the bar. "Waste of time. Leave this mess for the peasants to clean up. We have orcs to hunt."

Pelliton leaves the bar and mounts his black destrier (a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Warhorse.md\|warhorse]] named Penumbra) and rides northward. His four knights have brown coursers ([[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Riding Horse.md\|riding horses]]) outside as well, along with fourteen days' trail rations and other riding gear in their saddlebags. If the PCs try to track Sir Pelliton, one of them must make a successful DC 22 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check to follow his horse's tracks in the hard, dry earth. On a success, they find an abandoned camp that has a crude map of the Forest Rend, indicating the ruins of Castle Rend deep within. Pelliton's tracks away from this camp are all but untraceable, requiring a successful DC 25 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check to follow. If the PCs trail him immediately, night falls by the time they return to Gravesford.

If any of Pelliton's underlings are knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]], Giselle, the innkeeper, begs the PCs not to kill Pelliton's men, for even should they best the Star Knight, the rest of the Three Roses will make an example out of the innocent townsfolk. Knowing this, Pelliton will view any hesitation as weakness and try to force the PCs into a position where they must surrender or kill him or one of his men.

### Abduction in the Dead of Night

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/socr-abduction.webp#center)

A scream and a chorus of bestial roars shatter the stillness of the night. The sounds came from the edge of townâ€”from the edge closest to the forest. As the screams fade into silence, an explosion jolts the entire town into wakefulness, and a towering flame erupts at the southernmost tip of the village.

Just before midnight, a raiding party of twenty White Tusk orcs emerged from the boughs of the Forest Rend. They moved quickly through the scrubland and forded the river on the south end of town. The bridge guard Lenore heard something moving in the tall grass, and bravely traveled half a mile south from her post to investigate. She was shot dead and her corpse was left where it fell. The orcs invaded Pinna's house and knocked her [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]], but the rear guard accidentally knocked her lamp into a rack of volatile alchemical substances while looting her house (against Bonebreaker Dorokor's orders), igniting the entire house in a violet fireball.

If a creature is inside the house at the time of the explosion (such as if the PCs spend the night with Pinna, just in case), it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(21)` (`6d6`) fire damage. A successful save halves this damage.

The orcs abducting Pinna had already crossed the river when her house exploded. The rear guard that survived the fireball also fled. If the PCs are in the Reluctant Pig, it takes 2 minutes on foot to reach Pinna's houseâ€”by the time they arrive, the rear guard is about to ford the river, and the band of orcs carrying Pinna has already disappeared into the forest, but not without crushing undergrowth beneath their boots, creating a trail that a ranger could track with ease.

Unless the players made explicit plans to be awake through the night, it should take too long for them to suit up and run outside to catch the White Tusk. But it should be *possible* if they've decided, for instance, to stay up all night after dealing with Sir Pelliton.

#### White Tusk Rear Guard

If the PCs arrive at Pinna's shop within 10 minutes of the explosion, they get there just as the invading orcs' rear guard is about to cross the river. (Remember that it takes time for characters to don their armor, and it takes 2 minutes to reach Pinna's house from the inn.) These orcs turn and attack the PCs to buy time for their main force to flee. The rear guard is composed of 4 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Orc.md\|orcs]], 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Bloodrager (SAF).md\|White Tusk bloodrager]], 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Juggernaut (SAF).md\|White Tusk juggernaut]], and 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Warspeaker (SAF).md\|White Tusk warspeaker]]. If the PCs arrive any later, the orcs have already completely disappeared into the Forest Rend.

#### Pinna's Hut

The young hedge mage's house is ablaze and will burn to cinders within 5 minutes unless it is put out by dousing the flames with at least 30 gallons of water. The charred corpses of two orcs are inside, and unless the PCs bought these potions already, a character that makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check finds the following potions: 2 [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing.md\|potions of healing]], 1 [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Greater Healing.md\|potion of greater healing]], 1 [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Animal Friendship.md\|potion of animal friendship]], and 1 [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Poison Resistance.md\|potion of poison resistance]]. Nearly everything else has been destroyed.

#### Orc Path

If the PCs cross the river and head toward the forest, anyone who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check notices that the orcs have left a very visible trail in the tall grass. A character who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) or Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check sees Pinna's crystal necklace, her arcane focus, buried in a muddy boot print.

If the PCs track the orcs into the forest now, proceed to Part 2: The Forest Rend (page 100).

#### Militia's Arrival

A few members of the militia (4 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Guard.md\|guards]] and a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Scout.md\|scout]]) are able to don their armor and arrive on the scene about 10 minutes after the abduction. They inspect the house but realize that Pinna is gone, so they return to their homes. They plan to organize a meeting the next morning.

> [!note] White Tusk Main Force
> 
> Even if the PCs are somehow able to get to Pinna's house before any of the orcs escape, saving Pinna from abduction is no small task. The White Tusk main force is easily enough to level all of Gravesford if they so desired, and is composed of 10 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Orc.md\|orcs]], 3 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Bloodrager (SAF).md\|White Tusk bloodragers]], 2 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Warspeaker (SAF).md\|White Tusk warspeakers]], 2 [[5.

One of the juggernauts carries the captive Pinna.

### Tracking Pinna

At some point, maybe immediately, maybe the next morning, the players are probably going to try and hunt down the orcs that kidnapped the cool wizard they met. The most direct route is to literally track the orcs using [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]] checks (see Exploring the Forest on page 114). But the party may not have a ranger or, even if armed with a tracker, they may roll poorly! So we need another valve to release this pressure.

**Enter Alyssa Tealeaf.** She's a halfling girl, a little older than Pinna in literal years but the same emotional age. Her family are brewers in nearby Tarreton, and Alyssa often comes to Gravesford with her parents and stays with her best friend Pinna, and the two explore and generally get into mischief as though they were much younger girls.

Alyssa is a competent scout and can sort of handle herself in a fight, but like Pinna it's not her specialty. Anyone who travels the roads in these dark days needs to be good with a knife or a sword, or very good at hiding and being unseen.

Treat Alyssa as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Scout.md\|scout]] with the halfling Lucky trait ^[When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.].

If the players fail to penetrate the forest, Alyssa arrives with a donkey laden with brew, and upon hearing that her best friendâ€”who she was really looking forward to seeingâ€”has been kidnapped, she vows to help. She will risk her life to find Pinna, because she believes that's what friendship is about.

She's been through the forest before and knows about the castle, though she has no idea it's currently occupied by orcs. As soon as the heroes enter the castle's clearing, she'll exclaim that everything's changed. Expecting it to be overrun with rushes and the castle walls covered in vines, she finds the clearing...cleared, and the vines all pulled down. The orcs have been busy!

### Gravesford Rallies

If the PCs spend the night in town without tracking the orcs into the Forest Rend, they awake to the sound of all of Gravesford gathered in the Church of St. Gaed the Confessor to discuss last night's commotion. Mayor Osric, Giselle, Morgouse, Jago, and Father Belderone are here, but so is Carroc, and the richest man in Gravesford has browbeaten the other councilmembers into silence. He believes that if he and the local militia can rout the orcs, he will get the bounty, so he wants to stop anyone else from interfering.

Carroc treats the adventurers with disdain and refuses to let them speak unless he's overpowered by a DC 15 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) check, though he relents if one of the PCs can convince him that they are a noble from Bedegar Keep, requiring a successful DC 15 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]) check.

At the start of the meeting, the few militiamen who investigated the night before reveal that Pinna was kidnapped by unknown assailants. Carroc is organizing a posse of villagers. The villagers are hesitant, but they feel powerless to resist unless the PCs intercede. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) check is enough to assess the combat-readiness of these villagers. They are poorly equipped, with little more than padded armor and pitchforks, and even the fighters in the militia are no match for a bloodthirsty horde of orcs.

Once the PCs have the floor, a successful DC 10 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) check is enough to turn the crowd and the other members of the council against Carroc, defeating him in a majority vote, and winning the PCs the chance to defeat the orcs and perhaps win a knighthood from Lord Saxton ^[This would be weird, but I don't know your playersâ€”they might like working for Shakespeare's Richard III.]. If the PCs don't intervene in this meeting, a posse of 20 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Commoner.md\|commoners]], 10 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Guard.md\|guards]], and 5 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Scout.md\|scouts]] are assembled from the brave men and women of Gravesford. They find Castle Rend after a day's travel, but none return.

If the PCs convince the council to keep the posse from forming, Father Belderone approaches them after the meeting adjourns and offers to grant one of them a powerful blessing that will protect them on the journey, if they are able to donate 100 gp to the church (see Church of St. Gaed the Confessor on page 106).

### If the Players Do Nothing

This is deeply unlikely, but I always think if you know what would have happened if the PCs never acted, you're much better armed for when things inevitably go off the rails.

#### The Posse Departs

On the second morning after Pinna's abduction, a posse of 20 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Commoner.md\|commoners]], 10 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Guard.md\|guards]], and 5 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Scout.md\|scouts]] assembles at the edge of the Forest Rend. They refuse the PCs' help, on the orders of Carroc. If the PCs play up the danger of the quest and make a successful DC 13 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) check, the villagers lose their nerve and beg the PCs to embark on the journey themselves. ("Bandits are one thing...but orcs? They're monsters! They'll tear us all apart!") If she hasn't already, Alyssa Tealeaf arrives and volunteers to help (see Tracking Pinna on page 112).

#### Steeltwister Arrives

At sundown on the third day after Pinna's abduction, a horde of 20 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Orc (SAF).md\|White Tusk orcs]] sets out from Castle Rend for Gravesford. By nightfall, an orcish horn sounds from the forest's edge, and [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Oregg Steeltwister (SAF).md\|Oregg Steeltwister]] (page 140) arrives with 2 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/White Tusk Juggernaut (SAF).md\|White Tusk juggernauts]] and over a dozen other warriors. Oregg has come to parley. His immediate goal is to establish communication with the town, tell them Pinna is alive and being held in Castle Rend. His ultimate goal is to get someone important from the town (he doesn't know the PCs don't qualify, he assumes they are Gravesford natives) to journey with him back to the forest. There, Bonebreaker Dorokor will reveal the treachery of Lord Saxton and show his claim illegitimate by producing the rightful heir to the barony.

Oregg is prepared to fight.

Ideally, though, the players will already be off chasing after the orcs into the forest primeval!
