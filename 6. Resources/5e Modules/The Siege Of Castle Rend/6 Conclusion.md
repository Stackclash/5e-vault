# Conclusion
*Source: The Siege of Castle Rend, p. 137* 

The heroes rebuffed Sir Pelliton's army and saved Pinna, and Edmund Bedegar is now free from the orcs' clutches! If you are playing using milestone XP rules, each PC advances to 6th level.

More important than XP, however, is Castle Rend! The PCs are now the proud owners of a stronghold of their very own. Using the rules in this book, they can populate and modify it as they see fit, making it their home base between quests. Though this adventure is at an end, the story of the PCs and their stronghold has just begun.
