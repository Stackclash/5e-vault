Whether by blade or by bargain, the characters have gained control of Castle Rend. They now have a stronghold of their very own! However, they won't be truly masters of their domain until they have defended it from invaders. Fortunately, Sir Pelliton intends to give them that chance. His army arrives in one week. The PCs must gather allies, fortify their position, and prepare themselves for Pelliton's attack.

This week will be eventful...

## Dorokor's Aftermath

Lots of stuff happens once Dorokor is taken care of, and the players have many opportunities to gather information about their real enemy—Sir Pelliton—and prepare for a battle. In this section, we'll also walk through the steps of deciding what kind of stronghold Castle Rend is, what rewards the players get based on this decision, and how and what kind of units they have available for the coming battle.

Right now, the PCs probably have no idea that Sir Pelliton is on his way. They have other business that they may wish to deal with, such as making sure the White Tusk orcs head off, returning Pinna to Gravesford, and perhaps scheming with Edmund about how to take back Bedegar Keep. That last quest is beyond the scope of this adventure and could even be the basis of an entire campaign. If the players are interested in such a campaign, they should be prepared to invest in their stronghold, gather followers, and become lords with the might to challenge Saxton on his own terms.

### Edmund's Reward

Edmund approaches the apparent leader of the group, or the most knightly, or the most lawful, in that order.

> Edmund looks you in the eye. "I do not hold Bedegar Keep. I have no army. I am young—but I am my father's son. I am the Baron of Bedegar, and I owe you my life. Let this be my first act as baron. Kneel. And someone hand me a sword."
> 
> Edmund taps the sword on your shoulders, his hands trembling slightly with the weight of it. "Arise, knight of Bedegar. I invest you with this castle, too, just as the knights of Good King Omund held it in elder days."
> 
> Ceremony over, the boy becomes a little less formal. "Well, you are now my privy council. What shall we do now?"

Edmund is a natural-born leader, but he is unsure of himself. He will need time and guidance to grow into his role as Baron of Bedegar. The PCs may approach this situation in many ways: Some may wish to help him, serving as powerful advisers to a young baron. Others may wish to have nothing to do with the boy, and would prefer to let him live with Father Belderone in Gravesford in secret until he is ready to take back Bedegar Keep.

Depending on how much the PCs like Edmund, you may make him a major NPC or relegate him to the role of a background character until the time for war with Lord Saxton is at hand.

### Setting Up Shop

The players may want to stay here and dispatch one of their own as a messenger back to Gravesford. If they do this, then Willoughby Twobuckle (see A Cog in the System, page 129) infiltrates the castle to meet with them.

Twobuckle is a high-level thief, so infiltrating the castle won't be hard for him, but the players may have the means to detect him—an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Alarm.md\|alarm]] spell would do the trick—in which case he doesn't put up a fight. He's only a messenger, after all.

Pinna and Edmund are both willing to go back to Gravesford on their own, but this is exceedingly dangerous as neither of them is a competent adventurer and the forest is still hazardous. Someone from the party should accompany them.

### Returning to Gravesford

> "Do you think we could...go home? I couldn't stay in this castle, not yet," Pinna says. "Not after being dragged off by orcs and kept here against my will. Besides, I'm a wizard. I need my supplies, and my potions, and...well, the people of Gravesford need me! Not that I wouldn't like to live in a castle. Real wizards do live in castles...or towers! If that ruined tower were fixed up into a real-life wizard's tower, I don't think I could refuse."

Pinna's kidnapping started this entire quest, and she wants to return home. Returning with her to Gravesford is easy for the heroes now that there aren't any orcs in the way. If you want to slow things down and make the trip feel difficult, roll once on the Forest Rend Encounters chart (page 114), but it's also reasonable to skip the encounter and return to town without the hassle. Edmund also wishes to go, requesting that he not be left alone in the empty, literally haunted castle.

Upon returning to Gravesford and revealing Pinna to be unharmed, the townsfolk welcome the PCs back as heroes and invite them to spend the night in the Reluctant Pig—no charge. All the children in town cluster around the PCs, asking them for stories of their adventures, and the adventuresome grandmother Helanna joins the crowd.

#### Edmund's Birthright

Keen-eyed Giselle catches sight of Edmund and asks, "Who is the boy?" Edmund glances at the PCs, waiting for them to make the first move. He is bold and noble, but sensible. If his protectors aren't willing to reveal his identity yet, he will oblige. If they choose to conceal his identity, he bides his time. If they do reveal his identity, the villagers are shocked and instantly bow to their baron. Carroc demands proof, but Edmund's ring ^[None of the orcs had any idea this was anything other than a trinket.]—the ruby signet of Bedegar—instantly puts him in his place. The greedy farmer is the willing supplicant of the most powerful person in the room, and that is Edmund...for now. Edmund has no real power until he sits upon the throne of Bedegar, and if Sir Pelliton or Lord Saxton comes calling, Carroc will betray the PCs in a heartbeat.

#### Pinna's Return

Pinna returns to her shop, dismayed to see it practically razed to the ground.

> "There was an explosion! I remember now," she muses, clearly in shock. Seeing the shop's wreckage, she turns to the PCs with a new fire in her eyes. "You own a castle now, don't you? It's time to get started on that wizard tower! Just you wait, I'll be able to make you potions and little charms...and you'll even have visitors from town willing to do business every now and then!"

If the PCs accept her, Pinna is willing to become their stronghold's wizard—their first follower! This won't preclude them rolling on their follower chart. If they manage to put to rest the spirits in the wrecked tower and rebuild it, she will be able to do her own spell research! *Pinna's elucidating [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Person.md\|hold person]]*!

#### Willoughby's Secrets

That night, in the Reluctant Pig, the PCs are approached by a halfling who, judging by his accent, isn't from around these parts. His name is Willoughby Twobuckle, and he comes with vital information for the PCs. See A Cog in the System below.

## A Cog in the System

> "Oh, ah...hey. Good job with that orc lady by the way. Who's this? Looks like the baron's youngest son. Wow. Hey you folks are screwed, you know that right?"

The night after the White Tusk clan is driven from Castle Rend (forcefully or not), the PCs are surreptitiously approached by a halfling named Willoughby Twobuckle. If they are in Gravesford, he slyly approaches them at the inn. If they are in Castle Rend, he slips in and accosts them in the dead of night. His hair is curly and red but is slicked back against his scalp by a thick coat of grease, and he wears leather armor underneath his rustic tunic. Willoughby is an agent (or a Cog) of the Clock, a local thieves' guild with operations across Vasloria.

He speaks in a clipped and sneering accent, and fears nothing. Agents of the Clock have been spying on the PCs since they first arrived in Gravesford, and he tells the PCs that his superior gave him orders to help them out as best as he could without revealing to Saxton that the Clock opposes his regime.

His news is this: Sir Pelliton knows of Castle Rend and is preparing to attack the castle. He does not know that the orcs are no longer there, but if he learns that the PCs have killed or driven them off, he will stop at nothing to destroy the PCs. Pelliton is a deeply insecure man, and will not allow commoners like the PCs to claim Saxton's reward and stand beside him as equals.

> "So, yeah, I figure you folks got about a week before that pigstain Pelliton shows up at your new castle or whatever. His army ain't big but Saxton has some...nasty friends. You know what a gnoll is? Well you'll see.
> 
> "Anyway, the word is out there about you folks and the castle in the forest. And Saxton ain't exactly popular. I know a couple of companies of foot used to work for the old baron will probably come by to help. But it wouldn't hurt to find a few hundred more friends who can fight and take orders...
> 
> "Oh...and you're gonna have to kill Pelliton, too, you know that right? 'Cause he's coming for you personal. Pelliton can get into your castle. We don't know how exactly, but we know he got it from Saxton and we think Saxton got it directly from Mortum, Ajax's wizard. Fun times."

The players are free to debate what this "way in" is. They will almost certainly include a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleport.md\|teleport]] spell in their guesses, which will make them feel smart when it turns out that's exactly what happens.

## A Week to Prepare

The PCs have a little time to travel around to nearby villages and recruit allies to help them defend Castle Rend. If the PCs found it, the castle's hidden treasury has a great deal of gold to facilitate the hiring of mercenaries from nearby Tarreton, and there are woodworkers and stonemasons in Gravesford and other nearby hamlets that could be paid to rebuild the castle's crumbling fortifications. Rangers and foresters could also be found to create a guarded road through the Forest Rend connecting Gravesford and the castle, to make travel safer and quicker.

While the players deal with their newfound wealth and title, it's time to figure out whose stronghold this is, how much it's going to cost to fix up, how long it will take, and what rewards the players get from it.

## Castle Rend Costs and Rewards

The orcs cleared out all the overgrowth, but they had no capacity, or indeed desire, to repair Castle Rend and restore it to its former glory or usefulness. **If the players spend no money to repair this place, then it can only serve as a 1st-level keep**, in spite of how large this place is. It's just too dilapidated to serve as anything greater.

Of course, the aforementioned treasury of the Blue Dragon Phalanx would pay for quite a lot of repairs, but that assumes the players have found it. If not, depending on how much cash the heroes have accumulated in their adventures, and how much of it they're willing to part with, they may not be able to afford much renovation.

Before we know how much this place will cost to fix up, we must determine what kind of stronghold Castle Rend will be. This will tell us how much it will cost to repair and what benefits it will give.

### A Keep or a Castle?

Rend is certainly a walled fortress, so it qualifies as a **keep**, it has **towers** (and at least one is mostly functional), and there is a **temple** in the dungeon below! But, the word "castle" is right there in the name...

It's just not a very *large* castle. It's a big keep, though! You should feel empowered to put the issue in front of the players: "You can either use this place as a 3rd-level keep or a 1st-level castle."

The players may decide, seeing as how they're about to fight a big battle, that it is currently a keep, but later they might want to add a tower or temple to it, making it a castle. That's fine—it's just going to cost a lot more money and take time (see "Upgrading Your Stronghold" on page 11).

#### Choosing a 3rd-Level Keep

A 3rd-level keep costs 25,000 gp to build, but since the players aren't starting from scratch, it only costs half that: 15,000 gp. It takes 300 days to build a 3rd-level keep, but since we're starting with a level 1 keep, it takes half that: 150 days (about five months).

Your players don't have 150 days, though—they've got about a week. It's up to you to dole out the rewards, as described below. At the very least, the players should get their unit rewards so they can defend this place.

You might also let the martial characters train in the keep or let someone roll on their follower chart to attract some units, as described below. But it's best to hold off *some* reward for when the construction is complete.

- **Units.** Roll five times on the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Training Units Raised By Keep Saf.md\|Unit Raised by Keep]] chart (page 17) to see which units arrive to pledge service.  
- **Stronghold Benefit.** At your discretion, characters who volunteer to help train the new units get one of the keep's training benefits ("page 17").  
- **Followers.** If you're feeling generous, you may let one of the players (they decide which) roll on "their Follower chart" to see who or what arrives to say, "Love what you're doing, how can I help?" Because this is a 3rd-level keep, you may let them roll once now, again in three months, and then once more when the construction is complete. Or wait until it's all done after 150 days and let them roll three times (because it's a *3rd-level* keep).  
- **Class Feature Improvement.** You may decide to hold off on awarding the improved class feature until construction is complete, but it's up to you. You could award units and the improved class abilities now and hold off on training and rolling on the follower charts until construction is further along. If you award the class feature improvement now, they are a reward for every character who helps pay for the renovation. It's also assumed those characters are helping supervise the construction or otherwise actively helping with the work in some way.  

#### Choosing a 1st-Level Castle

A 1st-level castle with three strongholds in it—in this case, a keep, a tower, and a temple—costs a total of 16,900 gp and takes 253.5 days to build. That's 10,000 gp for a keep, and 8,000 each for a tower and a temple, +30% for having three strongholds in one castle, then the total is halved because they're not starting from scratch. Likewise, a keep takes 150 days to build, and a tower and temple each take 120 days, then add +30% for three strongholds, then halve it for starting with a ruin.

- **Units.** Roll three times on the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Training Units Raised By Keep Saf.md\|Unit Raised by Keep]] chart (page 17) to see which units show up to help them fight Sir Pelliton.  
- **Stronghold Benefits.** If you want to let the players open their presents early, you can let them start using the keep, the tower, and the temple. Normally it takes weeks for spell research; you can enforce that rule or *this one time* let the player roll after only a week's research, assuming that their entire career up 'til now has been research.  
- **Followers.** The players will ultimately get to roll three times on the Follower chart—once for the keep, once for the tower, once for the temple. Right now, you decide whether they go to roll at all, or whether they'll have to wait for construction to be further along and word of their deeds to spread. It's probably reasonable to let them roll once now, roll again in 126 days, and roll a final time at the end of construction.  
- **Improved Class Abilities.** Anyone who's contributing money to the construction will get the benefits of the Improved Class Abilities, but when they gain those benefits is up to you. It's best to save something as a reward for finishing construction, and this is a good candidate. But you could decide that the final Follower roll is the reward for finishing and so grant the players Improved Class Abilities immediately.  

## Recruiting Units

The players have rolled for their new units. These are standard infantry and missile units. If the players want more, cooler units, they're going to need to use their heads.

This book has no hard and fast rules restricting which player controls which units. Units belong to whoever's paying them, or whoever recruited them, or whoever built the stronghold. During a battle, any player can give an allied unit orders on their turn. There's no narrative connection between the unit they're ordering around and the PC. In this sense, units are like NPCs the players can all order around.

Even if they don't have a keep, even if they don't have any money, there's nothing stopping the PCs from going to the NPCs they've met and helped and just *asking* for aid. We saw Aragorn do exactly this with Théoden in *Return of the King*. Five wizards were sent to Middle-earth to stop Sauron, but the only one who succeeded was the one who spent his time on diplomacy, riding around to all these different factions making sure they were all ready when the war finally came.

**So ask the players: "Okay, what else are you going to do to recruit new units?"** If they ask you in return, "I don't know, what can we do?" consider just asking them back, "Well, who do you know who might be able to lend aid?"

Of course, I don't know your campaign, but many sample units are included on pages 146, 147, 262, and 263 to help you out. Here are two obvious options:

### Peasant Levies

Not only can the players recruit local peasants to help work on repairing the keep, the people of Gravesford and nearby towns *want* to help. Let the players think for a while, but if they're having problems coming up with possible allies, *the peasants volunteer*.

Anytime you're dealing with a large category of people like this, "the peasants," it's a good idea to pick a specific NPC and have them speak for the group—someone from Gravesford who's come up to the ruin to help the heroes.

There's no roll here, because the peasants want to help the players. They hate Lord Saxton and Sir Pelliton, and they like the heroes! I hope. So as soon as the players ask, or when the peasants volunteer, give them the [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Gravesford Levies Saf.md\|Gravesford Levies]] card (page 146)

This presents the players with an important moral dilemma: Levies take casualties first (see "The Order of Battle", page 239). This is their job. They act as the "hit points" of your army, soaking up casualties so more powerful units live longer and inflict more casualties on the enemy.

But these are the peasants Castle Rend is ostensibly meant to defend! So now **the players must decide whether to field these units.** They don't have to! Apart from the moral component, there's no real downside to fielding them ^[If we were using the realm management rules from *Kingdoms & Warfare*, we might decide that losing all their peasants would degrade the local town into a thorpe or a hamlet.].

### Bonebreaker Dorokor

What?! Yes! One group of mine went through this scenario and managed to come out with Dorokor as, if not an *ally*, at least not an enemy. And she was convinced by clever negotiation to lend aid in the final battle.

If your players negotiated successfully with Dorokor, and she's still out there somewhere, they could dispatch a herald or one of their own to send an offer. As the players are scrambling around trying to treat with every powerful NPC they've met, I don't make them worry too much about how much time it takes them to get around. We just take it for granted that wherever Bonebreaker Dorokor is, the players can communicate with her.

#### Negotiation with the Bloodchief

Bonebreaker Dorokor has many reasons not to trust Men, but if the PCs previously negotiated with her successfully *and* they're going to fight Saxton, then she's probably down to help. But this still requires a DC 26 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) check.

If they succeed on the check, Bonebreaker Dorokor will lend aid if the players agree to do the same when it comes time for her to wage war. But as much as she hates Lord Saxton and doesn't think the PCs are a complete waste of good meat, she needs more than assurance from the PCs. She needs a guarantee. She wants leverage.

She wants Pinna.

> "Me?!" the young wizard exclaims.
> 
> Dorokor nods her head toward her shaman. "Shaman blesses the tribes, curses our enemies. This is good. But a *wizard*? Orc tribes have no wizard. You live with us, make us potions. Scrolls."
> 
> "Can you...can you read?" Pinna asks timidly.
> 
> "Read? What does that have to do with anything?"
> 
> "Oh! Um. I dunno. Stupid question now that I think about it, maybe a *wand* or two?"
> 
> Dorokor shrugs. "Wand is good too. You live with us for...six months. If giants attack? Gnolls? You will help us, you will call your friends, they will bring their army. Then, you are free to return. Otherwise, when six months pass...you return home. What say you?"

*This* is politics! Pinna is going to need a little [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]], DC 13 ^[Remember, a successful check requires some roleplaying. It's not enough to just ask which skill the player will use, but how they will use it: "What do you say to Pinna?" Players who are clever, insightful, or inventive in their speech should have advantage on the roll.]. Failure means she's simply too terrified to go, doesn't trust the orcs, and refuses to abandon the people of Gravesford. Success means her curiosity gets the best of her, and the orcs agree to let others visit so she can still provide potions and unguents to the people of her town.

The reward is Dorokor's troops.

## Inventing New Units

If the players recruit Dorokor's troops, they get about 900 points of units. With their own Levies and fortifications, that's about 1,200 points of forces versus about 850 points of troops from Sir Pelliton. That should result in a heroic victory for the PCs!

If the players don't recruit Dorokor's troops—perhaps because they killed Dorokor—they're gonna need about 900 points of new units. Check out "Creating Your Own Units" (page 235) for rules on assembling your own units. Who these new troops are and why they arrive to pledge service, that's your decision as GM—maybe they're from a nearby barony?

It's probably wise to give the players at least as many units as there are PCs. Having a variety of units, infantry certainly—along with some archers, cavalry, or both—is good. If you've designed the right number of the right kind of units and you're happy with the army that's coming to save the heroes, but its point value is too low, the easiest thing to do is just increase the units' size. Adding more types of units adds bookkeeping, but increasing unit size makes an army more powerful without more bookkeeping.

When all is said and done, the PCs have cleared out Castle Rend, taken it over, started repairs, attracted their own units, and recruited more units. It's time for them to defend what they've taken.

## An Actual Siege

Risk-averse players might think the best thing to do is take their army and simply stick it inside their new keep and wait for the attacking army to get bored and leave. Or stand on the ramparts and use the crenellations to plink away at the enemy with arrows.

This never works.

There's a great quote from Clausewitz about how the best way to weather a siege is to be on the outside of the castle. Even if you could fit your entire army inside Castle Rend (the average unit is about a hundred soldiers), and even if, through spells and rationing, you could keep them fed and disease-free for a month or whatever, the enemy army is still demolishing your walls from well outside bowshot, and as soon as that begins, the peasantry you're protecting will begin freaking out and trying to leave, which gets them killed, which was the thing you were trying to avoid when you raised an army to stop the enemy in the first place.

The best tool to stop an enemy army is your army. And your army needs room to maneuver, and that means fighting on the field, preferably the field you choose on your terms.

If the players attempt to turtle up inside the walls, explain that **only three of their units will fit in there**, assuming they also want to protect the local peasants who've been helping with the keep. Otherwise, the rest will be exposed. Furthermore, explain that if Sir Pelliton arrives with siege engines (spoilers: he will), their range is much greater than bow or spell, and their new stronghold will soon be a pile of rubble.

## The Encounter

This system assumes that every battle (units clashing) happens at the same time as an encounter (heroes clashing with villains).

This encounter takes place either inside the courtyard or on the battlements. Wherever the bulk of the PCs are.

Sir Pelliton arrives with his wizard Curor and six other allies in the flash of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleport.md\|teleport]] spell read from a scroll. The PCs can see the scroll in Curor's hand turning to dust as the magic is expended. He's casting the spell from a scroll because he is not high enough level to know the spell. Here are the enemies in the encounter:

- [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Npc/Sir Pelliton Saf.md\|Sir Pelliton]] (page 142)  
- Curor, his wizard (as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Mage.md\|mage]])  
- Riddel, an evil cleric (as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Priest.md\|priest]])  
- [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Npc/Faldric The Archer Saf.md\|Faldric]], an archer (page 143)  
- Four knights (as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Knight.md\|knight]])  

The players may want to ignore the encounter and, for instance, try to go outside and take out the catapults themselves.

Doing this means surrendering the defense of the castle, in which case Sir Pelliton opens the gates. The castle no longer provides any Morale bonus to the players' troops but worse, the levies immediately flee (their heroes quit the field!) the orcs leave for the same reason, and all remaining ally troops must make a DC 15 Morale check or suffer one casualty. If the heroes want the benefits of the stronghold as a fortification and its psychological value to their troops, they must stay and defend it.

## The Battle

The players have the units they recruited, as well as Castle Rend itself. Sir Pelliton arrives with the following units: [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Saxtons Riders Saf.md\|Saxton's Riders]], [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Bedegar Archers Saf.md\|Bedegar Archers]], [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Catapults Saf.md\|Catapults]], [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Bedegar Company Of Foot Saf.md\|Bedegar Company of Foot]], and [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Redclaw Demonrunners Saf.md\|Redclaw Demonrunners]]. The gnolls may be a surprise, but it's merely a sign that Lord Saxton is in league with fell powers.

In the full warfare rules ("page 233"), units have Commanders: NPC allies to the heroes who command their units on the battlefield and give the units access to many more maneuvers than are presented here.

But the simple warfare rules ("page 243") let the players just run their units without assuming their PCs have any direct control over anything. We assume the units have sergeants commanding them, and the players control the sergeants.

### Running the Battle

Pelliton is perfectly happy to focus on the heroes' peasant levies—in fact, this is an excellent way to put down a rebellion. He doesn't have any levies, so casualties go directly to his infantry, but he does have his gnoll allies to soak some damage.

If the players have any archers, he orders his cavalry to attack them. This can be devastating, as archers are squishy and cavalry is...not.

Meanwhile, his catapults hammer the players' castle.

### Possible Outcomes

**If Sir Pelliton dies,** his army surrenders. The gnolls disband and flee into the forest, and Pelliton's remaining allies lay down their arms. They hope, they presume, the PCs will ransom them back to Lord Saxton. How successful that is depends on what kind of villain you think Saxton is.

**If Pelliton's infantry is eliminated,** the cavalry retreat, and the gnolls disband. The cavalry aren't going to fight without an army, and the gnolls are certainly not going to fight without the knight they made their bargain with.

**If Castle Rend falls,** the heroes lose their orc allies and their peasant levies, and all remaining units must immediately make a DC 15 Morale check or suffer a casualty.

**If the heroes' units are eliminated,** Pelliton and his allies gain an extra attack (not an extra attack action) each round as a Morale bonus.

### The Fall of Castle Rend

The players might lose this battle. If they fight to the death and are captured, Sir Pelliton puts them in chains and tries to return them to Bedegar Keep to be executed—giving them many chances to escape!

If this happens, Sir Pelliton's army invests the keep, and another Knight of Three Roses, Lady Ruth or Sir Anglim, arrives to command the troops while Pelliton returns to Bedegar.

Otherwise, we hope the PCs win!
