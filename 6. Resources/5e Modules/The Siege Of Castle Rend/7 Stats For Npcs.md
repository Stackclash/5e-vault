# Stats for NPCs
*Source: The Siege of Castle Rend, p. 137* 

The NPCs and monsters found in this adventure are listed below. The White Tusk orcs have minion abilities ("page 66"), while Bonebreaker Dorokor and Sir Pelliton possess villain abilities ("page 66") they can use to bolster their minions in combat.

Minions in the service of a stronghold commander also possess minion traits that represent the skill and discipline that their commander has instilled in them, which they demonstrate even when their commander is not present.
