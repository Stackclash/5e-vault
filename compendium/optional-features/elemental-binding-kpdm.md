# Elemental Binding
*Source: Deep Magic p. 152*  

***Prerequisites*** 10th

You add [planar binding](compendium/spells/planar-binding.md) to your spellbook if you don't already have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell in this way, you must target an elemental creature associated with your elemental focus. If the elemental fails its saving throw, it gains temporary hit points equal to your wizard level. You regain the ability to cast planar binding with this mastery when you finish a long rest.
