# On the Day of the Destruction of the Fiends
*Source: Deep Magic p. 219*  

This symbol represents triumph over your enemies, victory, and celebration of those victories.

**Benefit(s):** You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma ([Intimidation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks.

**Power (3rd level):** To trigger this power, you must use an action to trace the symbol on yourself with a knife or other sharp object (pressing hard enough to leave a mark on the skin but not hard enough to draw blood) and emit a loud battle cry. Each creature you designate within 10 feet of you that hears the battle cry must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) for 1 minute.

**Mastery Power:** Once a week, you can host a feast for your companions and other allies. Each individual who partakes in the feast gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) and has advantage on the same number of its next attack rolls. The effect dissipates for each creature after 24 hours if the benefits have not been used by then.
