# Tewaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 243*  

*Fearlessness, assemblies or councils, the god Tyr*

- **Benefit.** You gain advantage on saving throws against the [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition.  
- **Power (4th level).** Tewaz can be sketched on an object to ward off [wolves](compendium/bestiary/beast/wolf.md), [worgs](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/worg.md), [werewolves](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf.md), and other lupine creatures. The object must be presented boldly toward such creatures, each of which makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must stay at least 5 feet away from the rune and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature presenting it, as long as the symbol is boldly and aggressively presented (which requires an action each round). Sketching the rune takes an action, and the marked object remains effective for 1 hour.  
- **Power (5th level).** When tewaz is sketched somewhere clearly visible, it produces the effect of a [calm emotions](compendium/spells/calm-emotions.md) spell on all creatures that can see it within a 20-foot radius. Sketching the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
