# Ehwaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 238*  

*Horses, freedom, the [Nithing Pole](compendium/items/nithing-pole-kpdm.md)*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks made to control a mount, and to Dexterity checks made to wriggle free of bonds.  
- **Power (5th level).** Using an action to trace ehwaz on a lock or a set of shackles has the same effect as casting a [knock](compendium/spells/knock.md) spell, but makes no sound.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When you sketch ehwaz on the ground, you can produce the effect of a [phantom steed](compendium/spells/phantom-steed.md) spell. Sketching the rune takes 5 minutes, and the illusory steed remains for 1 hour or until it takes damage.  
- **Mastery Power (13th level).** You can create a [nithing pole](compendium/items/nithing-pole-kpdm.md) once per month. The process can be performed only during a new moon, takes 12 hours, and requires bloodletting that leaves a permanent scar in the shape of the ehwaz rune on the rune maker's left hand. Each new use of this power creates a new scar; those after the first don't need to be on the hand, but they must be on the hands or arms.
