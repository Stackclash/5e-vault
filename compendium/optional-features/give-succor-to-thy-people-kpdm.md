# Give Succor to Thy People
*Source: Deep Magic p. 217*  

This symbol represents charity, Healing, benevolent leadership, and Sanctuary given to Friends and kin as well as enemies.

**Benefit:** You have advantage on Wisdom ([Medicine](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) checks.

**Power:** If you spend an hour in meditation while holding a mug of beer or a goblet of wine, your sincere wish to help someone transfers into the brew. When a creature drinks the brew, it gains all the benefits of finishing a short rest. This brew remains potent for 24 hours.

**Mastery Power:** If you spend an hour in meditation while holding a full Waterskin, up to six creatures that drink from the Waterskin recover from two levels of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) and don't need any food or water until after finishing a long rest. The water remains potent for up to 24 hours, or until six creatures have drunk it.
