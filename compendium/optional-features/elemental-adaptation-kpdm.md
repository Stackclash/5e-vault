# Elemental Adaptation
*Source: Deep Magic p. 152*  

***Prerequisites*** 14th

You add [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) to your spellbook if you don't already have it, and you can cast it once with this mastery without expending a spell slot. You can travel only to the elemental plane associated with your focus element, or to the Material Plane. While you are on the elemental plane, you aren't harmed by the normal conditions of the plane, you can breathe normally, and you can use your speed to move in a manner appropriate to the plane (flying for air, burrowing for earth, and swimming for water). You regain the ability to cast [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) with this mastery when you finish a long rest.
