# Dagaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 238*  

*Day and laying the dead to rest*

- **Benefit.** You can always tell whether a creature you can see within 10 feet of you is alive or dead.  
- **Power (4th level).** If you use an action to trace dagaz on a creature that is [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), or diseased, the creature's affliction is cured as if by a [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell.  
- **Power (6th level).** Tracing dagaz on an object makes it give off bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for 60 feet beyond that. Magical darkness of 3rd level or lower is dispelled in an area where this light overlaps it. The light is blocked as normal by opaque objects or structures. Tracing the rune for this purpose takes an action, and the light lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (13th level).** Once a week, you can sketch dagaz on the ground or a wall to create an instantaneous effect identical to a [cleric's](compendium/classes/cleric.md) [Turn Undead](compendium/classes/cleric.md#Channel%20Divinity%20Turn%20Undead%20(Level%202)) class feature. Sketching the rune takes an action, and it affects undead within 30 feet that can see it at the moment of its completion.
