# Flourish in Death as in Life
*Source: Deep Magic p. 216*  

This symbol represents the transition from the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. It is often engraved on the tombs of Fallen heroes.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Constitution saving throws.

**Power:** When you drop to 0 hit points, you become stabilized immediately and automatically.

**Mastery Power:** You can see a distance of 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane for 1 hour. You also can determine whether anyone within 60 feet of you is possessed by a spirit; you see such a figure as having a vague, dim outline around it.
