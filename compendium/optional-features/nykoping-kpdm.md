# Nyköping
*Source: Deep Magic p. 241*  

*Passage of time, the seasons, phases of the moon*

- **Benefit.** You gain proficiency on Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks.  
- **Power (5th level).** When nyköping is sketched on the ground, up to six creatures of your choice can each regain hit points equal to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) + your Wisdom modifier. You must be able to see the creatures, and they must be within 30 feet of you. Sketching the rune in this way takes 10 minutes.  
- **Power (6th level).** When you take an action to trace the rune on the ground under an open sky, nyköping creates the effect of a [gust of wind](compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell. The wind lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (9th level).** Tracing nyköping on a creature grants it the benefit of a [haste](compendium/spells/haste.md) spell. Drawing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (13th level).** When you sketch nyköping on the ground beneath the open sky, the weather in the area improves toward clear skies, as if you had cast [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md). The rune can only improve the weather, not make it more severe. Sketching the rune takes 1 hour, and the effect lasts for 8 hours.
