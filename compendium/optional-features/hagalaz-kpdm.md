# Hagalaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 239*  

*Hail, winter weather*

- **Benefit.** You have advantage on Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks to predict weather conditions for the next 24 hours in your vicinity.  
- **Power.** If you take an action to trace hagalaz on a willing creature, it receives the benefit of a [protection from energy](compendium/spells/protection-from-energy.md) (cold) spell while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (5th level).** When you sketch hagalaz on the ground under the open sky, you produce the effect of a [sleet storm](compendium/spells/sleet-storm.md) centered on a point you choose within 150 feet. Sketching the rune takes 4 rounds, and the storm lasts while you concentrate, for up to 2 minutes.  
- **Mastery Power (14th level).** When hagalaz is sketched on the ground inside the area of an effect caused by [sleet storm](compendium/spells/sleet-storm.md), [ice storm](compendium/spells/ice-storm.md), [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) (hail or blizzard only), or a similar spell, the rune brings about a [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) effect as if that spell had been cast with a 7th-level slot. If the effect being dispelled is from 8th- or 9th-level magic, you use Charisma for the ability check to determine the rune's effectiveness. Sketching the rune takes 2 rounds.  
- **Mastery Power (14th level).** When hagalaz is sketched on the ground inside the area of a natural (nonmagical) storm, the rune brings about the effect of a [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) spell. Sketching the rune takes 1 hour, and the control lasts while you concentrate, for up to 8 hours.
