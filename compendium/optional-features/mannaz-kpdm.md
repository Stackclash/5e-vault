# Mannaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 241*  

*Humanoids, especially [humans](compendium/races/human.md) and [dwarves](compendium/races/dwarf.md)*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against [petrification](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) and against effects that alter your form, such as lycanthropy, [polymorph](compendium/spells/polymorph.md), or [flesh to stone](compendium/spells/flesh-to-stone.md).  
- **Power (5th level).** When mannaz is traced on the ground, a boulder, or a wall, it produces the effect of a [calm emotions](compendium/spells/calm-emotions.md) spell on all living creatures within 20 feet of the rune. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When you use an action to trace mannaz on the flesh of a creature, the act returns a lycanthrope to its humanoid form or dispels (as if by [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md)) a polymorph effect the target is currently under. An unwilling creature can resist this change with a successful Charisma saving throw (using your Wisdom modifier to set the DC).  
- **Mastery Power (9th level).** Tracing mannaz on a plant or animal causes it to be affected as if by the [awaken](compendium/spells/awaken.md) spell. Drawing the rune in this way takes 8 hours, and the effect is permanent.
