# Meat Hook
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 112*  

***Prerequisites*** 3rd Fighter (Butcher)

If you dealt piercing damage, you may make a [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) check against your target by lodging your weapon in your target's body as part of the same attack. While you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) this way, you cannot make attacks with the weapon you used to [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) them. Whenever a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) in this way attempts to escape the [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) and fails, they automatically suffer `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) piercing damage as they clumsily attempt to remove the weapon piercing them.
