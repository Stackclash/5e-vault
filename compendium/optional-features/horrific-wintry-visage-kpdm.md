***Prerequisites*** 5th, "The Frozen One" Patron

You can cast [sculpt snow](compendium/spells/sculpt-snow-kpdm.md) once using a warlock slot. Creatures that see your sculpture for the first time must make a successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of the sculpture for 1 round. You must finish a long rest before using this invocation again.
