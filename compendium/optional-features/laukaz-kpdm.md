# Laukaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 241*  

*Water, the sea, the god Njord*

- **Benefit.** You gain Primordial as a bonus language. If you already know this language, you have advantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks involving creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water.  
- **Power (4th level).** When you take an action to trace laukaz on an object, it becomes more buoyant for 24 hours. Anyone grasping the object has advantage on Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to swim or to stay afloat.  
- **Power (7th level).** When you trace laukaz on a living creature's chest, the creature gains the benefit of a [water breathing](compendium/spells/water-breathing.md) spell. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts for 24 hours.  
- **Mastery Power (11th level).** When you draw the rune on the surface of a lakebed, a riverbed, or the sea bottom, you can manipulate a 100-foot cube of the nearby water as if by a [control water](compendium/spells/control-water.md) spell. Sketching the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.
