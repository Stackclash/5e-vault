# Amnayeth (Benevolence)
*Source: Deep Magic p. 178*  

This seal allows the user to reroll a failed ability check to improve another creature's attitude. *Greater:* As an action once during the next minute, the user can cause a creature that can hear the user to make a successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) for 10 minutes.

This seal can't be used again on a check involving the same creature until the user finishes a short or long rest.
