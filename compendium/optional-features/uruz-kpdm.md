# Uruz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 243*  

*Wild oxen, sacrifice to the gods, strength*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +2 bonus to your Strength score for the purpose of determining carrying capacity.  
- **Power (4th level).** The wielder of a shield that has been inscribed with uruz gains the benefits of the [Charger](compendium/feats/charger.md) feat. Tracing the rune takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts for 1 hour.  
- **Power (5th level).** When uruz is traced on the flesh of a living creature, the creature's carrying capacity doubles, and the creature has advantage on Strength checks. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When you trace this rune on an appropriate sacrifice (food, a symbolic weapon, an animal), any offenses the sacrifice giver has committed against the gods are forgiven (treat as a [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) effect). Tracing the rune in this way takes 1 hour, and the sacrifice must be offered no more than 1 hour later.
