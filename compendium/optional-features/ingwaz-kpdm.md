# Ingwaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 240*  

*Ancestors, major deities*

- **Benefit.** You have proficiency on Intelligence ([History](/compendium/rules/skills.md#History)) checks.  
- **Power (4th level).** When you use an action to trace ingwaz on a [spear](compendium/items/spear.md), the first character who uses the [spear](compendium/items/spear.md) against an enemy adds `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) radiant damage to attacks made with the [spear](compendium/items/spear.md). The first attack must be made within 8 hours after the rune is traced, and the benefit lasts for 1 minute after it is triggered.  
- **Power (5th level).** When you trace ingwaz on the face of a willing creature, the creature gains the benefit of the [barbarian's](compendium/classes/barbarian.md) [Rage](compendium/classes/barbarian.md#Rage%20(Level%201)) class feature, as though it were a [barbarian](compendium/classes/barbarian.md) of your character level. Tracing the rune takes two actions, and the effect lasts for 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When ingwaz is traced on the flesh of a corpse, the rune creates the effect of a [speak with dead](compendium/spells/speak-with-dead.md) spell on that corpse. Tracing the rune takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.
