# Berkanan
*Source: Deep Magic p. 238*  

*Birch tree, love, new beginnings; the Bear Maiden*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma ([Persuasion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks.  
- **Power.** When you trace berkanan on a living creature, the rune grants the creature advantage on a single Charisma ([Persuasion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check of its choosing. Tracing the rune takes 10 minutes, and it remains effective for up to 1 hour.  

    When you trace this rune on a living plant, an effect identical to a [spike growth](compendium/spells/spike-growth.md) spell erupts in a 20-foot radius around the rune. Tracing the rune on a plant takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** You can create a [philter of love](compendium/items/philter-of-love.md) once a week.
