# Chapter 3: The Harvest Tables
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I, p. 6* 

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> After countless autopsies, vivisections, experiments, and just plain butchering, I have amassed what is most likely the most complete set of knowledge regarding the anatomies, uses, and values of the wondrous creatures that inhabit our worlds. I now present this knowledge (as well as some rather choice anecdotes) to you, dear reader.

## Understanding the Tables

Every unique monster from the "Monster Manual" has been listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant monster in this guide, and read out the results (monsters are listed in the same order as in the "Monster Manual"). The following is an explanation of how to read the table.

### DC

This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to successfully harvest that item.

### Item

The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Aarakocra Feather (small pouch) or Aboleth Mucus (3 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.

> [!embed-variantrule]- Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials
> ![Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/optional-rule-harvesting-dangerous-materials-hhhvi.md)

### Description

A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a "**Use**" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.

Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material will be listed here.

### Value

All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependant on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as "varies" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.

When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, Aboleth Mucus is harvested as a set of 3 vials, and so the value listed (20 gp) refers to each individual vial (so successfully harvesting Aboleth Mucus would be worth 3 Ã— 20 gp = 60 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Aarakocra Feathers are harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: "small pouch." Thus the 8 sp value listed refers to the value of a "small pouch of Aarakocra Feathers", not 8 sp for each individual feather.

> [!readaloud] Value Factors
> 
> The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although a Death Knight Heart may be worth the high price of 4,000 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.
^value-factors

### Weight

The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.

### Crafting

Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.

The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.

## Humanoid Trinket Tables

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> In general, humanoids do not yield much in the way of harvestable materials. Partly this is just the negative relationship that humanoid evolution has with innate magical abilities, but mostly it's just because polite society frowns upon butchering things that look vaguely like themselves.

Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armor. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.

There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to be largely used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse.

Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.

## Harvest Table: A

### Aarakocra

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Aarakocra are an interesting folk. As stoic and flighty as the birds they resemble, they nevertheless make good company when coaxed down from their solitary perches. Interesting as well is that despite being very magical themselves, their wings are relatively useless for any sort of crafting. Perhaps the Wind Dukes of Aaqa realised that having servants everyone would want to hunt would be a bad idea.

### Angels

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I have never claimed to be a saint myself, and in my pursuit of rare game and hunts I will admit that I have drawn the ire of more than one angel. While tussling with an angel is a risky proposition, harvesting one is even worse as it comes with the risk of ticking off their celestial patron. But then again, if you've gone far enough down the dark path to kill an angel, you've probably already committed yourself to being on the wrong side of a god's attention.

While an angel's parts may be useful, harvesting a good-aligned angel is considered a universally evil act. Most good-aligned gods will condemn any character that perpetuates such a thing, even if the angel being harvested was not theirs. As such, any character attempting to harvest or attune to an item made from an angel that is still in service to a good-aligned god has a 30 percent chance of being inflicted with the *curse of the fallen*.

While inflicted with the *curse of the fallen*, a creature becomes vulnerable to radiant damage and any magical healing that comes from a good-aligned cleric or paladin automatically fails when used on the cursed character. This curse can only be removed if the cursed character spends 24 hours in a vigil at a temple of the god of the angel who they attempted to harvest or whose part they attempted to attune to. After these 24 hours, a follower of that god may then cast the spell [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) to end the curse.

While others may see them as savage and uncivilised, they partake in wonderful games and acrobatics during their festivals. Indeed, as strange as the idea may be, I once saw a group of centaurs stacking themselves upon one another in a dizzyingly high tower! There are some wizards out there that have attempted to disprove my claim, stating that such an occurrence is ludicrous and impossible given a centaur's anatomy, but I swear on my life it is true.

### Demons

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Demons are a nasty bunch, and even nastier to harvest. Looking past the fact that they possess unholy strength, vitality, and power; they don't even leave behind a useful carcass if slain in the Material Plane! Instead, they dissolve into a useless ichor while their spirit scurries back to the Abyss. Imagine the gall of these beings: to lose an honest fight, and then not give up your spoils to the victor! The impropriety!
> 
> P.S. Of course, other than that I should mention that using anything harvested from a demon comes with a certain risk of spiritual erosion, eternal damnation, demonic corruption, et cetera.

Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Abyss.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll for it on the table below.

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: "You have a constant need to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly possible."

### Devils

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Devils are just as bad as demons in terms of harvesting. To have the nerve of making me go all the way to the Nine Hells just to harvest some devil blood is the height of rudeness. As a small upside, their ichor does make for a wonderful substance with which to tar one's roof.

Due to their fiendish nature, devils slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcasses dissolve into a foul ichor or disappear into smoke instead. These serve no purpose and are effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Nine Hells.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a devil comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a devil part, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic.

More than once have I downed a mighty dragon, only to find my assistants were draconic cultists who immediately stole my prize out from under me by lobbing a spirit gem at it.

### Dragons

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Of all the trophies that a hunter can bag, a true dragon tops the list. Physical embodiments of fire, lightning, cold, poison, and acid; all wrapped up in iron-hard scales and gale-force wings. One would be a fool to hunt these creatures alone; to hunt them with friends only marginally less so. But the rewards are great. Almost every part of these magical creatures are useful in some way, whether it be for crafting, spellwork, or just a culinary delight. Still, it is important to note that the older and larger a dragon is, the more valuable the game. The parts of a properly harvested young dragon alone can sell for thousands of gold pieces, but the proceeds from an ancient dragon would put you, your children, and your children's children in comfort for life.

Dragons are identified in 4 stages of life: Wyrmling, Young, Adult, and Ancient. The harvesting tables below outline the different types, quantities, and qualities of parts that can be harvested from dragons at different stages of their lives. When noting down the parts harvested, it is important to note which age bracket of the dragon being harvested, as the value of the part and its utility in crafting varies wildly between age groups.

The harvesting table does not differentiate between the different colours/metals of the dragon it was harvested from. Instead, [Type] is used as a stand-in. When noting down the harvested part, replace [Type] with the colour/metal of the dragon it was harvested from. This is important, as different dragons are aligned with different damage types and resistances, which will ultimately change the nature of items crafted from that part.

Some crafted items will have differing levels of power depending on what age group the dragon it was crafted from belonged in. For example, dragon bone can be crafted into any weapon, but that weapon will have a different bonus depending on the dragon's age: +1 for young, +2 for adult, and +3 for ancient. The crafted item will specify in its description when such a distinction makes a difference.

Crafted items may also change their nature depending on the colour/metal of the dragon it was crafted from. If a crafted items description refers to the "harvested dragon's damage type," refer to the following table to determine that damage type.

Carrying the remains of an empyrean make you particularly susceptible to the [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) attempts of the divine parent of that empyrean. While holding any material taken or crafted from an empyrean, you automatically fail the saving throw associated with the casting of the [scry](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell, or similar ability, by the parent of that empyrean.

### Hags

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> The rules for hags is the same as that of disasters: they're dangerous, they're best to be avoided, and they tend to come in threes. Harvesting a hag is also a dangerous proposition as contact with their bodily fluids carries the risk of contracting the dreaded '[crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease).' Great care should always be exercised when carving up one of these ladies, otherwise you run the risk of looking like my childhood nanny for the rest of your life

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting "[Crone's Disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease)." Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease). A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease) as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.

Upon contracting [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease), 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) may return the creature to their normal appearance.

A lycanthrope reverts to its true form when it dies, and as such, it should be treated as a member of its original species when harvested. The only exception is in harvesting its blood, which is changed irrevocably due to the curse.

### Medusa

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund

> Medusas are interesting creatures to harvest for several reasons. The first is that it is quite difficult to harvest something you are not allowed to look at directly, as the medusa's petrifying gaze persists even after its death. The second, is that their granite-like composition means that a medusa's body does not decompose the way a normal creature would. As such, a freshly harvested medusa head can remain recognisable (and thus usable) for many years.

Due to the fact that a medusa's petrifying gaze remains active even beyond the death of the medusa, any character attempting to harvest the medusa must do so while averting their gaze. Doing so imposes disadvantage on any check made to harvest the medusa, unless that character is capable of another reliable method of [perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception).

### Oozes

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Oozes are a staple of any good adventure experience, and every good adventurer should know how to repurpose the nasty things for their own uses. Best to exercise caution when harvesting them however, as their slime remains active even after the animating force behind them is gone.

If you fail on an attempt to harvest any item from an ooze, you suffer half the acid damage associated with that oozes pseudopod ability as you spill the slime over yourself by accident.

Unfortunately, so far the only results of their experiments have been electrified fields and irate farmers.

Due to their large sizes and amorphous nature, a shambling mound can potentially be harvested several times. If you successfully harvest the "shambling mound mulch" or the "shambling mound vine" items, you may attempt to harvest them again, with the DC raising by 2 for each attempt. You may repeatedly attempt to harvest either of these items until the first time you fail on your harvesting check for them.

### Tarrasque

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> So powerful is the tarrasque; so awe inspiring, devastating, and unstoppable, that every single part of it has entered the lore of one culture or another. The tarrasque is in fact one of the few creatures in this Multiverse that I cannot boast about killing, and in truth, even I would not attempt to. The entries here on tarrasque parts are based purely on legends I have heard on my travels; ancient cultures that have inherited stories from even more ancient cultures. I shudder to know of which prehistoric society ever managed to fell a tarrasque and harvest it for their own use, and I shudder even more to know what force managed to wipe that society from the history books.

The tarrasque is so large that it cannot be easily harvested by any single adventurer, or indeed even a group of adventurers. The harvesting of a tarrasque for usable parts is an endeavour that would require a full company of workers a long period of time to complete, and that's before the time it takes to ship everything back and then make the parts usable.

The harvesting of a tarrasque takes 10 labourers proficient in harvesting a total of 30 days to complete (assuming that they work for 8 hours a day). Every 6 days, the labourers successfully manage to harvest 1 of the items on the [tarrasque's harvest table](compendium/tables/tarrasque-hhhvi.md). Due to the irregular method of harvesting a tarrasque, no check is made when attempting to do so, the labourers must simply put in enough work to finish the job.

Tarrasque parts do not face [Optional Rule: Carcass Degradation](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/optional-rule-carcass-degradation-hhhvi.md) regardless of length spent exposed to the elements, nor any lack of preservation. Even nature itself does not wish to oppose a tarrasque.

### Vampires

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I have never been a fan of tussling with vampires. Creatures of the night, they rarely present an honest fight, not to mention the annoying fact that most items harvested from their long-overdue corpses whisper temptations to those that possess them. When I go monster hunting, I am looking for trophies, not gossipy boarders.

Items crafted or taken from a vampire carry with them a dark undead energy that makes using them a risky proposition. Anytime a creature attuned to an item made from a vampire part attempts a long rest, there is a 10 percent chance that they will be afflicted with the *Gravemaster's Curse*. At the DM's discretion, this roll may be made in secret, with the result unknown to the relevant player.

A creature cursed in this way can't voluntarily end their attunement to the item that cursed them, and they feel a need to be within arm's length of that item at all times. Whenever the cursed creature sleeps, they hear whispers of temptation from the vampire from whom the cursed item was made but forgets it as soon as they awaken. A cursed creature is not necessarily aware they have been cursed. After 7 consecutive days of being cursed, a cursed creature will take any opportunity to be alone and to get away from anybody that would be able to identify and remove the curse.

If a creature remains cursed by this item for the continuous length of one full lunar cycle, they are possessed by the soul of the vampire from whom the item that cursed them was created. When this happens, the creature is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and loses control of their body which also transforms into a full vampire. The possessing vampire spirit retains all of their old memories, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as any spellcasting abilities it may have had. It otherwise adopts the possessed target's statistics, as well as any of their knowledge, class features, and proficiencies. The returned vampire also retains attunement to any items the original possessed target had, including the item that cursed them in the first place.

The original soul of the possessed body is then imprisoned inside the item that cursed them. While imprisoned in this way, the original soul is aware of its immediate surroundings and can communicate telepathically with any creature in contact with them and vice versa. If the item is ever destroyed, the possessed soul is destroyed as well. The only way to lift the curse and restore the soul to its body is with either a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell, or if the possessing vampire breaks their attunement to the cursing item. If the curse is lifted in this way, the soul of the vampire is destroyed permanently and the original soul retakes control of their body. If the original body is destroyed, the original soul is sent to the afterlife.

Only one item made from a vampire can curse a target at any given time and a creature may only be cursed by one vampire's item at a time. While cursed, any attempt to attune to an item made from another vampire fails. A creature that has had this curse lifted from them may not attune to any other item made from a vampire again.

Like regular devils, yugoloths slain outside of their native plane also dissolve into an ichor rather than leave behind a corpse. Given the yugoloths artificial nature however, this ichor tends to be more useful than devil ichor and can be harvested for some benefit. Either way, a yugoloth slain outside of Gehenna cannot be harvested for anything except their respective ichor. Yugoloths slain on Gehenna can be harvested like a regular creature, including their ichor, traces of which can still be found in their veins.
