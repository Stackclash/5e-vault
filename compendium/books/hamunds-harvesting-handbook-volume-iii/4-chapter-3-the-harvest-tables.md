# Chapter 3: The Harvest Tables
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III, p. 6* 

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund

> There is nothing more thrilling to me than finding a new creature. The idea of hunting it, cutting it open, and then seeing what nature's bounty has in store for me is all the motivation I need to get out of bed in the morning. I have found many new species in my latest adventures and I present my findings to you here, dear reader.

## Understanding the Tables

Every unique monster from "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes" has been listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant monster in this guide, and read out the results (monsters are listed in the same order they are given in "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes"). The following is an explanation of how to read the table.

### DC

This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to successfully harvest that respective item.

### Item

The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Balhannoth Teeth (large bag) or Maurezhi Blood (3 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.

> [!embed-variantrule]- Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials
> ![Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/optional-rule-harvesting-dangerous-materials-hhhvi.md)

### Description

A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a "**Use**" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.

Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material will be listed here.

### Value

All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependent on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as "varies" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.

When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, Maurezhi Blood is harvested as a set of 3 vials, and so the value listed (5 gp) refers to each individual vial (so successfully harvesting Maurezhi Blood would be worth 3 Ã— 5 gp = 15 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Sibriex Cysts are harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: "large bag." Thus the 650 gp value listed refers to the value of a "large bag of Sibriex Cysts," not 650 gp for each individual cyst.

> [!readaloud] Value Factors
> 
> The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although a Sibriex Frontal Cortex may be worth the high price of 10,000 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.
^value-factors

### Weight

The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do. The listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.

### Crafting

Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.

The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.

## Humanoid Trinket Tables

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Once again, I must caution my readers against harvesting humanoids. The job is messy and of dubious ethics at best. I would advise you to take the marginally more acceptable practice of corpse-looting: at the very least it will be more financially rewarding.

Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armor. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.

There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to be largely used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse.

Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.

> In my younger and more experimental days, I once tried to capture and reprogram a cadaver collector to be my assistant. It seemed sensible at the time; we did both share the same penchant for reusing the bodies of what we hunt. However, while I was mildly successful in making it become my travelling companion, I had to dismiss it from my service due to its habit of spearing all my hunts on its back, thus ruining perfectly good pelts and organs. Oh well, I still got some use out of it; I took it apart and used the findings to make this entry!

### Clockworks

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> The infamous gnomish clockwork constructs have an interesting role in the great taxonomy of harvestable creatures (if you can even call them that). Because the methods of their creation are relatively well known, relatively intact specimens can be salvaged by any knowledgeable tinker into a working state. Not saying that you have to, but maybe keep it in mind before you go about melting their insides and whatnot.

Instead of harvesting the individual pieces of a clockwork, you may instead attempt to salvage the entirety of the creature to be fixed up by a well-supplied [tinker](compendium/optional-features/tinker-hhhvi.md). If you wish to do this, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a result of 18 or higher, the clockwork is in a good enough state to be repaired. You may still harvest a clockwork even if it is found to not be in a state of potential repair. Your DM may also decide that a clockwork that died under exceptional circumstances cannot be salvaged whatsoever (such as if it was completely melted into slag).

A repairable clockwork may be brought to any [tinker](compendium/optional-features/tinker-hhhvi.md) and fixed at a fee of 300 gp, and 1 week per hit die (this fee only covers material expenses; labour fees may vary from [tinker](compendium/optional-features/tinker-hhhvi.md) to [tinker](compendium/optional-features/tinker-hhhvi.md)). Once created, a clockwork will gain loyalty to the first creature it sees and will follow their directions to the best of their ability until it is reduced to 0 hit points again, at which point it becomes permanently unsalvageable and un-harvestable.

### Corpse Flower

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I once had a nasty run in with a corpse flower. I had been hunting down a rather wicked derro that had murdered one of my travelling companions, and I had finally managed to corner to villain and avenge my friend. Before I managed to extract a trophy however, a corpse flower appeared, grabbed the corpse, then dissolved it before my very eyes! Well, the last laugh was mine, as I killed that corpse flower and took one of its leaves as a proxy prize.

### Demons

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I am at my wit's end when it comes to demons. I have tried holy water, I have tried magical rituals, I have tried throwing salt on them at the time of their deaths; absolutely NOTHING can keep them from dissolving into a useless ichor. Do you know how inconvenient it is to have to go to the Abyss every time I need to collect some rutterkin livers? I am an incredibly busy man!

Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Abyss.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll for it on the table below:

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: "You have a constant need to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly possible."

### Demon Lords

However, even I have not accomplished EVERYTHING that the Multiverse has to offer, and unfortunately, one of those is to slay a Demon Lord. These masters of the Abyss are simply beyond my ability as an adventurer to fight or even find, and as I grow older, I must sadly admit that I may never find the chance to do so.

Should your reality not align with my ideas below, please feel free to send me a letter with the correct information. Who knows, I may even give you a mention in the next edition of my book!

Due to the unique and legendary nature of Demon Lords, there is no associated DC when it comes to harvesting their materials. It is entirely up to the whims of the DM and their story as to whether or not you are able to collect such powerful organs, and indeed, such things can serve as the basis of an entire campaign.

In addition, the regular curses that are normally associated with attuning to an item made from a demon are not present in these items. Each item associated with a Demon Lord comes with its unique curse.

#### Baphomet

As part of harvesting Baphomet, you may also loot his weapon, [Heartcleaver](compendium/items/heartcleaver-hhhviii.md).

### Devils

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> Someday I will discover a method to preserve the body of a devil that has been slain on the Material Plane, rather than letting it dissolve into ichor or smoke. Alas, that day has not yet come. On the bright side, I have plenty of specimens to experiment on, since for some reason devils keep trying to claim my soul for the Nine Hells.

Due to their fiendish nature, devils slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor or disappears into smoke instead. These serve no purpose and are effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a devil, they must be killed in the Nine Hells.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a devil comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a devil part, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic.

Due to the unique and legendary nature of some archdevils, there is no associated DC when it comes to harvesting their particular materials. It is entirely up to the whims of the DM and their story as to whether or not you are able to collect such powerful organs, and indeed, such things can serve as the basis of an entire campaign. These harvesting materials do not have an associated value either since these are also highly contingent on the campaign's context.

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund

> Many people hold qualms about harvesting the eladrin due to their humanoid-like appearances. I say that is simply rubbish, however. Despite their appearances, the eladrin are not humanoids. They are really more like living forces of nature, and you shouldn't feel any more guilt about harvesting one than you would feel when picking up a leaf. Admittedly, leaves don't have faces or the ability to speak, but that is a minor difference in my opinion.

### Elder Elementals

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund  
> 
> I am fascinated by the Elder Elementals. The Phoenix embodies the destructive power of fire, and yet is also a symbol of healing and rebirth. The billowing gales of the Elder Tempest somehow exhibits form without form. The Leviathan is fluid and yielding yet strikes with incredible force, while the Zaratan is the image of immovability, yet its presence shakes those around it. Much like nature itself, the Elder Elementals are capricious creatures of contrast, and the materials that can be harvested from them embody this same power.

#### Leviathan

> [!embed-table]- Leviathan

#### Phoenix

Due to the fiery death and rebirth trait, the Phoenix does not leave behind a usable corpse upon its death. Instead, it leaves ashes which may be harvested, while its entropy shard is blasted up to 150 feet away. In order to harvest a Phoenix's entropy shard, a harvester must first make a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to figure out where it landed.

When I killed a larva mage and saw it dispersing into writhing vermin, I was just about ready to cry out in frustration. However, on a lark, I tried harvesting the worms instead. To my delight, the attempt was successful (and also quite profitable). I'm not sure what the moral of this story is, something to do with never giving up, I suppose?

In order to harvest the star spawn larva mage, you must first kill the swarm of insects that is formed when it uses its return to worms trait. The bulk of this swarm is treated as the larva mage's corpse for the purpose of harvesting.

### Yugoloths

> [!quote] A quote from Hamund

It is especially good because I have had to fend off many yugoloths after a lifetime of contracting them for expeditions and neglecting to pay for their services. They never seem to understand that by including them in my books, I am practically overcompensating them in publicity!

Like regular devils, yugoloths slain outside of their native plane also dissolve into an ichor rather than leave behind a corpse. Given the yugoloths artificial nature however, this ichor tends to be more useful than devil ichor and can be harvested for some benefit.

Either way, a yugoloth slain outside of Gehenna cannot be harvested for anything except their respective ichor. Yugoloths slain on Gehenna can be harvested like a regular creature, including their ichor, traces of which can still be found in their veins.
