## Aim of this Guide

If you have ever played an open world fantasy RPGgame, chances are that it included some sort of mechanic to gather plants and herbs as you roam through the map. Other than providing useful buffs and abilities to the player, these herbs also serve as little pieces of worldbuildingâ€”changing availability as the environment does, or serving as quest items for NPCs.

This book aims to provide that same experience, as well as to serve the needs of any DM whose players constantly ask them if they can forage something while out travelling between quest locations. This book contains over 160 unique herbs, designed to be usable in any campaign that a DM can slot in to provide a whole new dimension of exploration and world building to their games. There's also rules for foraging, some new spells, and a couple extra goodies.

Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com (mailto:driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com) or hit me up on Twitter @drifterworkshop (https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop) to discuss anything in this guide.

Also, consider checking out some of my other works:the 'Hamund's Harvesting Handbook Volume I ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook I.json], Volume II ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook II.json], Volume III ^[collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook III.json]' series (also written under the fictional pen of the boisterous Sir Hamund Holderhek), and my naval combat guide 'Captains and Cannons' (https://www.dmsguild.com/product/256983/Captains-and-Cannons-A-Ship-Combat-Guide-in-DD-5e). Both are available on the DMsGuild in both PDF and Fantasy Grounds versions.
