# Enforcing a Contract

It's no surprise that infernal contracts require enforcement. The law of devils is a complex network of statues - reinforced with centuries of precedent. However, infernal law is not always just, and the days leading up to collection - the time when the fiend confiscates the signee's consideration - are bleak and hopeless. It is sporadic for a signee to be so accepting of their fate as to render payment to a devil willingly. Such signees represent dutiful mortals who entered such bargains out of necessity, such as fallen paladins and former soldiers. Because of the fear surrounding the merciless punishments administered in the Hells, most signees are dragged down kicking and screaming.

## Collection

It's common for a signee to struggle or attempt an escape when their time runs out. The majority of signees don't pose a threat to any devil capable of extending a contract, but occasionally one will require assistance in collecting what is owed to them. The signee may have been granted an item that's dangerous to the contract administrator, or perhaps their hard-earned prowess in magic allows them to hide for years on end. A signee that presents a significant risk of delay will find that the Nine Hells doesn't take retaliation lightly come collection time.

### Collection Agents: The Enforcers

Collection efforts are performed on behalf of the contract administrator. They are reimbursed by either the contract administrator or a higher-ranking devil to which the contract administrator reports, such as a duke or archdevil. These barbarous task forces may involve any number of devils outlined in the *Monster Manual* or *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*, but most collection efforts include [baggers](compendium/bestiary/fiend/bagger-da-gic.md), [bloodhounds](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/bloodhound-da-gic.md), and [handlers](compendium/bestiary/fiend/handler-da-gic.md) (see Appendix A for monster stats). Regardless of the type of devils that compose the group, these enforcers are commonly referred to as collection agents.

#### Baggers

Baggers are tall, gangly devils charged with transporting uncooperative signees to the Nine Hells. They get their name by stuffing writhing signees into claustrophobic, cursed sacks. Oftentimes, these bags contain nightmares - a taste of the horrors awaiting the signee at their destination.

#### Bloodhounds

Hellhounds are excellent trackers, but they're mediocre at sniffing out signees who can mask their trail with illusion magic or hide through a spell like [Mordenkainen's private sanctum](compendium/spells/mordenkainens-private-sanctum.md). Deep in the lorehouses of frigid Cania, servants of the archdevil Mephistopheles sought to remedy this problem by experimenting on hellhounds with ancient magic. The result was the bloodhound, a brutish tracker with a nose calibrated to arcane violators. When it's in range, the olfactory glands of a bloodhound's snout are capable of disrupting magical nondetection and illusions

#### Handlers

While some high-profile collection efforts are led by an ice devil, amnizu, or even a pit fiend, the quintessential picture of a collection agent is the handler. A handler's appearance varies throughout its existence, taking on a form pleasing to the entity that hires it. Despite these changes, every handler features exaggerated forearms with claws that inflict infernal wounds. Most of the time, however, a handler never has to lay a finger on the signee thanks to their manipulative magic.
