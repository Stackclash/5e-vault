# Getting Out of a Contract
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts, p. 15* 

Escaping the consequences of an infernal contract may seem futile, but it is not impossible. While the vast majority of attempts to circumvent infernal law have resulted in the signee being bagged, beaten, and taken to the Hells by a collection agent, occasionally a signee has successfully terminated their contract. This has happened more times than devils would like to admit (even as a sales tactic). A few methods of escaping judgment exist, though they have only been successful in rare instances through the efforts of brilliant individuals.

## Stalling

The most common approach is stalling by fight or flight. Pit fiends and even archdevils have better things to do than ensure every single soul is successfully obtained at the first collection attempt. Mephistopheles is not surprised when he hears that the bright, young apprentice that signed 7 0 years ago has become a master of the arcane arts with powerful friends. He cannot risk an uprising from the seven layers above him by sending swaths of pit fiends to the gates of an epic stronghold. The ruler of Cania is content to let his collection agents respawn in his icy fortress and send them on additional attempts in greater numbers, gathering information with each failure. Even masters make mistakes eventually.

## Terminating a Contract

The only way to permanently avoid collection is to terminate the contract. Grounds for termination can be established before the contract is signed through a cancellation clause or loophole, but mortals who escape their contracts usually do so after sealing the deal

### Combat Rebellion

To less-experienced adventurers, combat is not an option. Fighting off collection agents is hard enough; making a noticeable dent in a benefactor's forces is an impossible task. However, this is another story for a party composed of archmages and martial paragons. These parties are capable of planar travel and can cause permanent gaps in a benefactor's forces by killing devils permanently on their native plane. With the Blood War's drain on resources and the constant threat of usurpation, the administrator may renege on the contract altogether.

### Destroying the Contract

It's hard to enforce something that doesn't exist. Devils take many precautions to protect their contracts by making copious duplicates, protecting the original with wards and glyphs, and hiding documents in the most remote and secure locations across the Nine Hells. Although, if a signee is confident that they have eviscerated all traces of the agreement, they can invoke *corpus scripturam* ("body of writing"), an infernal right which states proof of contract must be presented at the time of collection. However, the signee may be surprised to find that they missed a copy.

### Loopholes

The sooner that a signee plans for termination, the higher their success rate. Mortal history is brimming with examples of educated nobles underestimating the common folk. Devils are no different in their perspective on inexperienced adventurers. If a signee can successfully feign ignorance, they may be able to slip in an exit plan when making alterations the document. A creative wizard may apply qualifiers to the contract's jurisdiction, only to live out the last few years of her life on another plane. A bard might spot the devil's fine print and pretend not to notice, only to twist it against the devil later in a cancellation clause.

### Substitution

A signee may be able to renegotiate the terms of their agreement in favor of something else. Substitutions are contractual amendments that must always be negotiated before the final collection. By displaying desperation to keep said consideration, a signee makes the first deal more alluring. Therefore, the contract administrator won't permit a substitution unless the deal is particularly favorable and outweighs the signee's original consideration. Historical substitutions include persuading influential mortals (usually nobility) on behalf of the devil, improving the standing of a diabolical cult, or delivering a significant blow to one of the contract administrator's rivals. Finally, a substitution may result in confiscation of the original offer.
