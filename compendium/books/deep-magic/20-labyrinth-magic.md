# Labyrinth Magic
*Source: Deep Magic, p. 304* 

The minotaurs created what they call "labyrinth magic" long ago, a result of their fascination with and mastery of mazes. Spells of this sort tend to involve elements of confusion, dimensional manipulation, and the strengthening of the minotaur's natural weapons. They are rarely taught to outsiders.
