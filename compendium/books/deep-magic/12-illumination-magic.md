Illumination magic concerns both the manipulation of light and observations of the heavens. Its practitioners have been likened to elemental specialists who have an affinity for light instead of fire, earth, air, or water. Naturally, these individuals are anathema to creatures and spellcasters that lurk in places where darkness and shadow hold sway.

## Illumination Magic Spell Lists

Mastery of illumination magic comes from long and dedicated study, and thus [wizards](compendium/classes/wizard.md) have access to more of these spells than other spellcasting classes do.

> Sharp-eyed readers will note that some of the spells described in the standard rules are given out to classes that were not originally included in those classes' spell lists. Granting access to those spells to a wider range of classes is a deliberate change, meant to showcase the expanded power and utility of illumination magic. If the GM decides that this approach is too generous, some or all of these adjustments might be disallowed.
