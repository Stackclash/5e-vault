# Spell Variations
*Source: Deep Magic, p. 347* 

This section contains riffs and twists for three classic spells: [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md), and [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md). These experimental variations are meant to entertain players and GMs who are more experienced with—or even jaded by—the standard versions. Changes affect both flavor and implementation, so the spells look different when cast, have different power levels, and even have radically different effects.

Each section covers one of the three standard spells, with variations on its theme. Some are similar in effect to the original but with altered story elements, and others have more pronounced tweaks to their effects on the game.

## Variant Spell Lists

All these variant spells are available in your campaign only with the GM's approval.
