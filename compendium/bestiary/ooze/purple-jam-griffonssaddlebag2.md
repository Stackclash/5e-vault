# [Purple Jam](compendium\bestiary\ooze/purple-jam-griffonssaddlebag2.md)
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 360*

A small and yet pernicious ooze, the purple jam looks like a mushy globule of smashed grapes or dark berries. They mindlessly consume plantlife, leading some to speculate that they originated from a goodberry spell gone wrong. Their wanderings often lead them to spaces like taverns where their natural camouflage is uniquely suited, and food is plentiful. A persistent creature, it's surprisingly difficult to destroyâ€”especially for the type of magical practitioners typically found in the small towns and cities they prefer.
