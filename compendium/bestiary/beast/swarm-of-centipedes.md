# Swarm of Centipedes

> [!quote] The Nature of Swarms
> 
> The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a [yuan-ti abomination](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination.md) might have [swarms of poisonous snakes](/compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes.md) slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.

## Traits

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: `dice: 4d4|avg` (`4d4`) piercing damage, or 5 (`dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`)) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a swarm of centipedes is stable but [poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and [paralyzed](compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way.
