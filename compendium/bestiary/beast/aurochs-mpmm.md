# Aurochs
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 71, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 207*  

An aurochs is a large, fierce bovine with jutting horns. In many lands, herds of aurochs roam free, while elsewhere orcs and humans train them from an early age to carry riders into combat.

## Cattle

Many kinds of cattle roam the multiverse, some of them domesticated and others feral. In many cultures, cattle are almost like family to the folk who tend to them.
