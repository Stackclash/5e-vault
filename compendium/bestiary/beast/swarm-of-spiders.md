## Traits

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Spider Climb.*** The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the swarm knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The swarm ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: `dice: 4d4|avg` (`4d4`) piercing damage, or 5 (`dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`)) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
