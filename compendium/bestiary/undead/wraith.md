## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+6` (+6 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: `dice: 4d8 + 3|avg` (`4d8 + 3`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Create Specter.*** The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a [specter](/compendium/bestiary/undead/specter.md) in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The [specter](/compendium/bestiary/undead/specter.md) is under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.
