## Attuning to the Remnants

Attuning to three Remnants of Dendallen is a gift as well as a curse. While a creature is attuned to three of these items, it can freely attune to other Remnants of Dendallen. When it does, its attunement to another Remnant ends, as well as its curse.

If Dendallen is dead, being attuned to these items activates a secondary effect once you reach level 15 (or 14 if there are 5 players in your group, etc.). When this happens, the attuned creature's cursed body becomes strong enough to handle the intensity of channeling the [spirit of Dendallen](compendium/bestiary/undead/spirit-of-dendallen-tgs1.md). The event is involuntary, and happens either at the end of a long rest or at your discretion.

> [!note] The Remnants of Dendallen
> 
> Items created by [Dendallen](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/nicrone-dendallen-tgs1.md) are called Remnants of Dendallen and double as vessels to store a portion of his spirit. At the time of his death, these Remnants can be scattered around the planes of existence or collected by his remaining devout followers: whatever makes the most sense for your campaign. Any item that bears Dendallen's name in its title is considered to be a Remnant.
> 
> Remnants are laced with necromancy magic that forces creatures to sacrifice a part of themselves in order to use them. The sacrifices, while potentially reversible, are more than just skin-or-bone-deep. As curses take hold, they begin to gradually provide strength and vitality to the lingering spirit of Dendallen trapped inside them.
> 
> If a creature attuned to at least one Remnant is in the presence of another Remnant that isn't attuned to by someone else, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with it and do anything within its power to take and attune to that Remnant before another creature is able to. The obsession lasts until the creature is unable to see or touch the Remnant for at least 1 hour or until it's targeted by either a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell.

## Dendallen's Return

When the [spirit of Dendallen](compendium/bestiary/undead/spirit-of-dendallen-tgs1.md) is channeled by a level 15 creature attuned to 3 of his Remnants, they become momentarily frozen in place. While unmoving, the creature's body begins to overflow in a torrent of green arcane and necrotic energy that spills forth from their back. The energy coalesces above them to form the towering, spectral avatar of Nicrone Dendallen's returned form: the [spirit of Dendallen](compendium/bestiary/undead/spirit-of-dendallen-tgs1.md). Its hulking, necromantically-charged form looms over the hosted creature and drips with ooze-like green necrotic ectoplasm.

The scraps of Nicrone Dendallen's spirit that were anchored in his Remnants combine to form the new spirit. These once-weak shards have been empowered as the attuned creature has sacrificed aspects of themselves through the items' various curses. Removing the worn Remnants from the host (even forcefully) fails to destroy or dispel the [spirit of Dendallen](compendium/bestiary/undead/spirit-of-dendallen-tgs1.md).

The spirit's appearance is that of a huge, muscular lich made of spectral miasma. Depending on the Remnants that the hosted creature has attuned to, the spirit's appearance may change to reflect the host's Remnants. Regardless of appearance, the spirit's abilities and power are unchanged.

Dendallen was an egotistical and jealous wizard in life, and death has not changed that. He despises other spellcasters that refuse to submit to him, especially those who deal significant damage to his spirit or to its host. However, Dendallen is also paranoid and desperate to retain his tenuous foothold on this plane, so his spirit will hoard its higher-level spell slots unless it is near defeat.

### Resilient Thrall

Once a creature attunes to three Remnants of Dendallen, nothing short of a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell can break their attunement to the items. However, once the [spirit of Dendallen](compendium/bestiary/undead/spirit-of-dendallen-tgs1.md) has been summoned, targeting the host with greater restoration, remove curse, the *break enchantment* effect of [dispel evil and good](compendium/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md) or other applicable spells of 5th level or greater grants the host advantage on their next saving throw to resist Dendallen's thrall. Likewise, any game effects that end possession or the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition don't end the spirit's thrall over its host, but do grant the host advantage on their next saving throw against the spirit's control.

### Personal Connections

Characters who share a meaningful personal connection with Dendallen's host can attempt to assist in their struggle against the thrall of Dendallen by reminding them of shared memories, such as telling inspiring stories or making personal pleas. At their discretion, you can choose to reward these attempts by granting the host inspiration to use on their saves against Dendallen's control.

### Psychic Roots

After 1 minute of the initial emergence of the [spirit of Dendallen](compendium/bestiary/undead/spirit-of-dendallen-tgs1.md), the hosted creature suffers disadvantage on all saving throws it makes to resist the spirit's Attuned Thrall ability. Once an additional minute has passed, the host becomes possessed by Dendallen, as described in the *Victory or Defeat* section below.

### Undead Nature

The spirit of Dendallen doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Magical Tethers

When the spirit of Dendallen is destroyed, all Remnants of Dendallen currently on that plane of existence decay into a gray goo and are destroyed, and any curse afflicting a creature from a Remnant is ended.

## Victory or Defeat

If the spirit of Dendallen is defeated, the host creature gains four levels of exhaustion. In addition, all Remnants of Dendallen on the current plane of existence, even those not attuned to by the host, turn to mush and are destroyed as the magic that anchored Dendallen's spirit is dispelled. All of the Remnants' effects and curses that were affecting the creature end.

If the spirit is victorious in combat and maintains its control over the host, it can spend 1 minute solidifying its ownership and possess the host. Once the creature is fully possessed in this way, the spirit of Dendallen can stay within the creature's body and command it indefinitely. The host creature shows no outward signs of the possessing spirit. While possessed in this way, the host automatically fails all saving throws against the spirit's thrall.

While Dendallen is proud of his necromantic achievements, his step into undeath is a shameful setback. He will do whatever it takes to remain within the possessed creature and maintain his sense of life unless absolutely necessary. The spirit can reemerge from the possessed creature as an action. When this happens, the possessed creature can resume attempting saving throws to maintain its free will, but they suffer disadvantage on each of these attempts. Use the spirit of Dendallen's stat block and the possessed creature's statistics for these saving throws.
