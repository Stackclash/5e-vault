# [White Tusk Warspeaker](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/white-tusk-warspeaker-saf.md)
*Source: Strongholds and Followers p. 140*

Priests of Grole, orcish god of war and slaughter, live for the chance to kill in the name of their bloodstained god. Dressed in war-robes of scavenged leather and mail, these priests bestow the blessing of pain upon their allies, goading them to die gloriously in combat in the name of Grole.

Warspeakers seek conflict constantly, flying into a frothing rage at the slightest provocation. When their clan is at peace, they scheme and search for ways to trick or coerce their chieftain into attackingâ€”and if they cannot, they scheme against their chieftain and convince a more aggressive orc into supplanting their "soft, peace-loving" leader.
