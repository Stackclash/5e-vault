# [Nicrone Dendallen](compendium\bestiary\humanoid/nicrone-dendallen-tgs1.md)
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 1*

Nicrone Dendallen is a human wizard whose passion for self-improvement has become an obsession, focused on removing the inherent limits of his own mortality. His focus on gaining power through sacrifice at any cost attracts dedicated sycophants. Their beliefs make them eager to recklessly endanger their lives for the chance to earn powerful rewards from his hand.

Dedicated and tenacious followers of Dendallen are given tokens of his appreciation: terrifying items made by Dendallen himself, each enchanted with a grotesque balance of strength and consequence.

While Dendallen is a master of the necromantic arts, his frustration with the limits of his mortal body makes him scoff at those who pursue longevity through undeath's tenuous hold on existence. Only under extreme circumstances—or the promise of extreme rewards—is he willing to work with undead creatures or the magic that enables them.

## Teachings of Dendallen

Dendallen's belief that self-sacrifice leads to self-improvement is a fervent mantra held by his followers. In general, those that subscribe to Dendallen's teachings believe that in order to truly become greater, you must be willing to let go of the mortal trappings that bind you. The major tenets of Dendallen are as follows:

### Embrace Self-Sacrifice

To forget the familiar as a price for greatness is admirable.

### Conquer your Limits

To become more powerful is to embrace the purpose of life.

### Enforce your Will

To conquer all obstacles in your path is to ensure success.

## Followers of Dendallen

Use the [cultist](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) and [cult fanatic](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) statistics for followers of Dendallen. Dendallen's more powerful followers can use other humanoid stat blocks that fit your setting and party level. These leaders are groomed to be more formidable than those deemed undeserving, unproven, or mediocre.

Typically, these trusted followers of Dendallen will have overt visual ailments or symptoms of disease, but will be notably more powerful because of it. Elite followers such as this will occasionally wield a Remnant of Dendallen, bestowed unto them after they complete a dangerous or otherwise notable feat of faith, loyalty and self-sacrifice. Upon defeating such a creature, your party can take the Remnant for themselves. The particular Remnant each follower wields is up to you, but should be scaled relative to the creature's challenge rating.

## Slaying Nicrone Dendallen

Killing Nicrone allows for his spirit to return at a later time. His final mortal words should capture his beliefs and foreshadow his return, such as "Giving up your weaknesses grants power beyond compare!"
