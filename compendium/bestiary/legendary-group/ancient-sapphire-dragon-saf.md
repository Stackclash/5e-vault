# Ancient Sapphire Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- The dragon manifests [flay](compendium/optional-features/flay-saf.md) in a 120-foot cone, doing 1d6 damage per charge spent.  
- The dragon manifests [reflection](compendium/optional-features/reflection-saf.md) at no cost. It cannot use this action again for a week.  
- The dragon casts [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) with DC 22.  

## Regional effects


Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of a sapphire dragon's lair dream of the past and future. They know the things they see in these dreams are real events that have, or will, occur.
