# Ancient Ruby Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- The dragon manifests [amplify](compendium/optional-features/amplify-saf.md) at no cost.  
- The dragon manifests [the real](compendium/optional-features/the-real-saf.md) at no cost. It does not require concentration and lasts for 10 minutes.  
- The dragon casts [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md). The spell automatically ends spells of 5th level or lower. For each spell of 6th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using the dragon's Intelligence as its spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's leveI. On a successful check, the spell ends.  

## Regional effects


Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of a ruby dragon's lair dream of people they know transforming into other people, of places they've been dissolving to reveal barren wastelands.
