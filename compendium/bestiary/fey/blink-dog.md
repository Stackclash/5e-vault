# Blink Dog
*Source: Monster Manual p. 318, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Eberron: Rising from the Last War, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, The Wild Beyond the Witchlight*  

A blink dog takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for displacer beasts and attack them on sight.
