## Traits

***Shapechanger.*** The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

***Magic Resistance.*** The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The slaad's weapon attacks are magical.

***Regeneration.*** The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The slaad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, `dice: d20+7` (+7 to hit) with spell attacks). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: detect magic, detect thoughts, invisibility (self only), mage hand, major image

**1/day each**: cloudkill, plane shift

**2/day each**: fear, fireball, fly, tongues
