# [Rot Monster](compendium\bestiary\monstrosity/rot-monster-griffonssaddlebag2.md)
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 362*

Considered a cousin to rust monsters in behavior if not biology, the rot monster thrives on spoiled, contaminated, or rotting food and drinksâ€”consuming them without suffering any ill effects. Its appearance is not unlike a featherless, scaly-skinned vulture, though its wings are almost vestigial. A vicious scavenger, it is willing to stalk living prey when the pickings are slim. In this instance, it shows a terrifying ability to rapidly putrefy organic material with its talons.

    \ Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rot monster's touch.\n\nIf the object touched\
    \ is either armor made of leather or hide, or a wooden shield being worn or carried,\
    \ it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced\
