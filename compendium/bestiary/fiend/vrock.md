## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

***Beak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+6` (+6 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 3|avg` (`2d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+6` (+6 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 2d10 + 3|avg` (`2d10 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Spores (Recharge 6).*** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). While [poisoned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a target takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of the vrock's next turn.
