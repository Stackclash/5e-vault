## Traits

***Vigilant.*** The defender can't be surprised.

## Actions

***Force-Empowered Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* the summoner's spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. Hit: `1d8 + PB` force damage.

***Repair (3/Day).*** The magical mechanisms inside the defender restore `2d8 + PB` hit points to itself or to one construct or object within 5 feet of it.

## Reactions

***Deflect Attack.*** The defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see that is within 5 feet of it, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the defender.
