Chantelle Redcliff, as the current Guildmaster of The Mercantile Guild, is accurately described as the most influential and powerful person in Antronec. The resources at her command within Antronec's government branches and underbelly are considerable, and she is more than willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that her guild retains its control over the city. She is exceptionally resourceful, and not to be underestimatedâ€”she has risen to her current role by proving herself the most capable politician and mage in The Mercantile Guild.
