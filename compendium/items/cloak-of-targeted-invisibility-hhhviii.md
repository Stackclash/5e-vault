# Cloak of Targeted Invisibility
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this cloak, you may spend your bonus action to force one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, magic clouds its senses and you become [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) to that creature for the next minute. This invisibility ends if you damage that creature in any way or you target another creature with this ability.
