This bone sickle has rows of teeth along its top and bottom edges. When you hit a target with the sickle, you can choose to speak its command word to cause the weapon to magically bite down, as if it were a voracious beast. You then let go of the weapon, and the target immediately takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage from the bite. The sickle remains held in place until it's removed, to a maximum of 1 minute. For the duration, the target takes another `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, removing the sickle from itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Once the sickle bites down on a target, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
