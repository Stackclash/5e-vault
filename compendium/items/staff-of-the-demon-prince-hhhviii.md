# Staff of the Demon Prince
*Melee Weapon, artifact, Crafted Artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVIII/StaffoftheDemonPrince.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Crafted Artifact](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20Artifact), [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

It is the belief in several demonic sects that [Demogorgon](compendium/bestiary/npc/demogorgon-mpmm.md) is fated to die upon the end of the Blood War and the resulting desolation of both devil and demon society. From the ashes of these realms will rise two twins, both of them immensely powerful warlords who shall raise armies against one another and start the war anew. They shall war over a magical Y-shaped staff crafted from the Prince of Demons themselves, with whoever holds it claiming dominion over the other and ushering in a new age of madness.

In order to attune to this item, you must hold it while killing someone you deem an ally, for it is the nature of the [Demogorgon](compendium/bestiary/npc/demogorgon-mpmm.md) to trust only themselves. When you become attuned to this item, your appearance becomes more vicious as your eyes turn bloodshot, your body quivers with restlessness, and you constantly foam at the mouth. If you end attunenement to this item, you revert to your original appearance immediately.

Whenever you cast a spell above 2nd-level while holding this staff, you have a 50% chance chance to create an illusory duplicate of yourself in your own space that lasts until the end of your next turn. On your turn, you may move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to your walking speed (no action required). The duplicate has your AC and disappears early if it suffers any damage or if a creature physically interacts with it in some way. The duplicate is otherwise indistinguishable from the real you and can only be identified as an illusion by a creature that uses its action to perform a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check against your spell save DC.

You may also use the staff as a [quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md) with a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. If you hit a creature with it, they must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take an additional `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage.

## Random Properties

The Staff of the Demon Prince has the following random properties:

- 2 [major beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) properties  
- 2 [minor beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) properties  
- 2 [major detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties.md) properties  
- 2 [minor detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) properties  

## Spellcasting

While holding this staff, you may use it to cast the [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), and [major image](compendium/spells/major-image.md) spells at will. You may also cast the [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md), [fear](compendium/spells/fear.md), and [telekinesis](compendium/spells/telekinesis.md) spells up to 3 times each and the [feeblemind](compendium/spells/feeblemind.md) and [project image](compendium/spells/project-image.md) spells once each. All expended uses are restored upon the next dawn.

## Beguiling Glare

As an action, you may target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the start of your next turn or until you are no longer within their line of sight. Unless the target is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see you until the start of your next turn. If the target looks at you in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

## Hypnotic Glare

As an action, you may target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you until the start of your next turn. On their turn, you choose how the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target uses its actions, reactions, and movement (no action required by you). Unless the target is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see you until the start of your next turn. If the target looks at you in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

## Insanity Glare

As an action, you may target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you, blasting them with a dazzling beam of light that assaults their mind. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effect of the [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md) spell. The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. You do not need to concentrate on the spell. Unless the target is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see you until the start of your next turn. If the target looks at you in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

## Twinned Glare

When you use this staff to use its Beguiling Glare, Hypnotic Glare, or Insanity Glare abilities, you may choose to use one of the other two glares on another target within 30 feet of the first as a free action. You may use this feature up to 3 times, regaining all expended uses upon the next dawn.

## Curse

When you become attuned to the staff, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [Madness of Demogorgon table](compendium/bestiary/npc/demogorgon-mpmm.md)* ^[See the info tab] and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Staff

This staff can only be destroyed if the creature attuned to it is slain by a creature attuned to an item made from a material harvested from another Demon Lord. If this occurs, the staff splits down its length into two parts and loses its power. However, if these two parts are thrown together into the waters of the Gaping Maw, the pieces will disappear and then reappear `dice: 1d100|avg` (`1d100`) years later in a random place in the multiverse, fixed and restored to full power.
