*Light armor ([leather armor](compendium/items/leather-armor.md)), uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 11 + Dex modifier
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this jerkin you become particularly sensitive to the vibrations and electrical currents around you. So long as you are [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) (including if you just have your eyes closed), you have [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) with a range of 60 feet.
