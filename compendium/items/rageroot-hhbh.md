# Rageroot
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

I never thought that anger could be expressed in vegetable form, but I stand corrected when I hold a rageroot. This distinctive, carrot-sized tuber is bright red and shaped into three branching prongs as if it is trying to stab the earth itself. Its taste is no less fierce as it packs a strong acrid punch followed by a prolonged spiciness that invigorates the senses and energises the mind in a way similar to a powerful adrenaline rush.

## Effect:

As an action you may eat this root. If you do so, you become immune to the [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned), [fear](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened), and [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) conditions for the next 10 minutes as you become filled with a manic rage.
