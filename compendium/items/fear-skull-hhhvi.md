# Fear Skull
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While holding this item, you may cast the [fear](compendium/spells/fear.md) spell, requiring no other components. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Furthermore, anytime a creature within 30 feet of this skull makes a saving throw to avoid the [fear](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition, they make that save at disadvantage.
