# Potion of Stamina
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, you gain a sense of inner strength and vitality. For the next 24 hours, whenever you roll a saving throw to resist an effect that causes [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion), you may make that roll at advantage. This potion is a bright blue with what looks like electricity running through it occasionally.
