# Torchbearer's Reach
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Torchbearers-Reach.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 F
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This weapon has the light property and deals fire damage instead of slashing. When held, a magical flame forms at the top of the whip's handle. The flame gives off bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. You can stretch the flame to form a 10-foot long coil of fire by snapping the handle and flame down as if to crack the whip (no action required). The flame doesn't hurt you while you hold the whip. You can snuff the fire out with your hand or blow it out to extinguish it using a bonus action.

The whip's flame is intangible and can't be used to bind a creature or retrieve objects from afar, but can be used to light other fires.
