# Doodle Ring
*Ring, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Doodle-Ring.webp#right)  


This magic wooden ring is always covered in splotches of charcoal, ink, or paint, regardless of how well or often it's cleaned. While wearing the ring on a finger, you can touch that finger to a solid surface and begin to draw. The drawing uses your finger to make marks as if it were a piece of charcoal, ink quill, or paintbrush (your choice). The marks you make can be in any color. Any drawing made by the ring can be easily smudged or washed away without leaving any marks behind. The ring can have up to a total of 5 square feet covered with drawings in this way at any time. Drawing more than that begins to erase the previous marks, and any mark left after 24 hours of being made is magically erased.
