# Potion of Puddle Scrying
*Potion, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Potion-of-Puddle-Scrying.webp#right)  


This potion is filled with a silvery solution. When you use an action to drink this potion, your eyes become as clear as water for 10 minutes. For the duration, whenever you open your eyes underwater, you can see and hear any recent event that's occurred from the water's perspective, up to 24 hours ago, reviewing the entirety of those events over the course of 1 minute. When you do, you relive these events as if you were just below the water's surface in the same space your head is in. You can only review events that occurred since the pool of water first appeared. You are deaf and blind to your surroundings while reviewing the events in this way.
