# Owl Helm
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Owl-Helm.webp#right)  


This helm is designed in the likeness of an owl. While wearing it, you can magically turn your head completely around to face behind you. If the helm is removed, your head returns to a normal position.

When you make an ability check to interact with an owl or related creature, such as a giant owl or owlbear, and are wearing this helm, you can roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and add the number rolled to the check. Once you do, this property of the helm can't be used again until the next dawn.
