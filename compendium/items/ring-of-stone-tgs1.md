# Ring of Stone
*Ring, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Stone.webp#right)  


This ring is made of magical stone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the [wall of stone](compendium/spells/wall-of-stone.md) spell (spell save DC 15).

When cast from the ring, the wall must be in a circle centered on you. The *wall of stone* is 10 feet tall and 6 inches thick.
