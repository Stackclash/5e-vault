# Hurricane Lance
*Weapon ([lance](compendium/items/lance.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Hurricane-Lance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 P
- **Properties**: [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [special](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Special%20Weapons)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The lance has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges each day at dawn. You can expend 1 charge as an action to surround yourself with a flurry of wind that lasts for 1 minute. While surrounded by this wind, you can take the [Disengage](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action using a bonus action. You can expend a second charge of the weapon (no action required) while surrounded by the wind to extend the effect to any mount you're currently riding. If you dismount or are forced off your mount, the effect fades from it. The effect ends early if you fall unconscious or are no longer wielding the lance.

In addition, you can use the lance to cast the [thunderwave](compendium/spells/thunderwave.md) spell at 3rd level (save DC 16). Once this property of the lance has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

## Special

You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
