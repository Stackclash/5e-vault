This heavy crossbow is painted a brilliant red and ornamented with golden flames and dragon horns. A dragon's fiery maw glowers from the weapon's front. The weapon has a magically rotating barrel, which easily holds and reloads up to six of your bolts for you. You can use an action to load the barrel with up to six bolts. The barrel spins and automatically reloads the crossbow with the next bolt from the barrel after you make a ranged attack with it, allowing you to ignore the weapon's loading property while it has any loaded bolts.

When you take the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action while holding the crossbow, you can forgo one of your attacks to lob an explosive orb of fire from the weapon's maw. The orb flies out to a point of your choice on a solid surface that you can see within 60 feet of you. The orb explodes on impact, creating a 10-foot-radius sphere of flame where it lands. Each creature within the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried within the area are ignited. The crossbow has 3 orbs and regains all expended orbs daily at dawn.
