# Fourarm Bracers
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Fourarm-Bracers.webp#right)  


These bracers can summon another pair of spectral arms below your existing ones. These arms can be summoned as an action and last for up to 1 minute before disappearing. While active, you can use the arms to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. Each arm can carry up to 10 pounds. The arms stay attached to your torso at all times and cannot be moved to other parts of your body, but can be turned around to face the opposite direction.

In addition, the gems adorning the bracers can amplify the arms' strength for short bursts. The gems have a total of 5 charges and recharge `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges each day at dawn. By uttering the bracers' command word using a bonus action and expending 1 charge, you can empower the arms to immediately make two unarmed melee attacks. The arms have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls and use your proficiency bonus when making the attacks. Each strike does `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) magical bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge to double the arms' carrying capacity and increase their duration to 5 minutes instead.
