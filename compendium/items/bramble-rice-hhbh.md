# Bramble Rice
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

While most grains hope to be consumed by animals so that their seeds will be spread as far as possible, bramble rice picks a much more ambitious target: monsters. The spiky husks around the rice grains prevent them from being eaten by lesser creatures, but seem to have no effect on the digestive systems of larger monsters who regularly forage for this herb and then spread it to their protected lairs and dens.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) charges. As an action, you may use a charge to scatter a pouch of this herb in a 5-foot-square area in front of you. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take `dice:1|noform|avg` (`1`) piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.
