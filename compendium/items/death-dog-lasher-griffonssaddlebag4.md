# Death Dog Lasher
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Death-Dog-Lasher.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This twin-lashed whip was made from the fur and hide of a death dog. A target hit with the whip takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) slashing damage from the attack.

When two of the whip's slashing damage dice roll a 4, the target of the attack must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the end of your next turn. For the duration, this property of the whip ceases to function.
