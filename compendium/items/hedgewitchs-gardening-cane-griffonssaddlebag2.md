This wooden walking stick has a silver flower at either end. The flower is blooming on the handle, but merely a bud towards the bottom. While holding the cane, you can use an action to tap it against the ground and mentally command the bottom portion to magically transform into a broom, a hoe, a rake, a shovel, or back into a normal cane.
