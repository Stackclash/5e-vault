# Scroll of Proclamation
*Scroll, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scroll-of-Proclamation.webp#right)  


This long magic scroll is empty when found. You can hold the scroll in front of you and read anything written on it aloud using an action. When you do, each spoken word is magically projected outward and is clearly audible out to a range of 300 feet. Up to 250 words can be spoken aloud from the scroll in this way, reading up to 25 words from it on each of your turns. You can continue to read aloud from the scroll on each of your consecutive turns, using an action each time. When you stop, deduct the number of spoken words from the scroll's total, rounding up to the nearest 25.

Once the 250th word has been projected from the scroll, its magic is lost.
