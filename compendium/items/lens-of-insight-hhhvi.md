# Lens of Insight
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this lens, you may target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You make a Wisdom ([Insight](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check contested against the target's Charisma ([Deception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Deception)). If you win, you magically learn one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed).

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
