# Death Mask
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this mask, you have advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks and anyone attempting to read your emotional state has disadvantage on their Wisdom ([Insight](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. In addition, you may spend your action to release a paralyzing gas in a 30-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in that cone must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 minute. A [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Each time you use this ability, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 1, the internal mechanism of this item breaks and cannot be used to release the paralyzing gas anymore.
