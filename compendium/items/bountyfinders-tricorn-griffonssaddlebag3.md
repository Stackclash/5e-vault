# Bountyfinder's Tricorn
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*

You're proficient with water vehicles while wearing this hat, and you have advantage on ability checks made to navigate them. A spade-shaped pin is magically clasped to the hat's edge; you can use an action to touch it and speak the name or description of an object you're looking for. When you do, you cast the [locate object](compendium/spells/locate-object.md) spell from the pin, targeting that object, and the pin transforms into a magic shovel. This version of the spell doesn't require [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) and has a duration of 30 minutes.

If you tap the shovel to the targeted object before the end of the spell's duration, the shovel then transforms back into the pin on the hat, which can then be used to cast the spell again. Otherwise, the shovel loses its magic and becomes a normal shovel.
