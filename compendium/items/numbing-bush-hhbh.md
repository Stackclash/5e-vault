# Numbing Bush
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

An ubiquitous bush long sought by creatures of all kinds due to its anaesthetic properties. Unfortunately, its numbing effects do result in a loss of coordinationâ€”something that trappers have taken advantage of by turning the leaves into bait that makes their quarry easier to hunt.

## Effect:

As an action, you may use this herb by rubbing it on your body and wounds. For the next hour, you gain 8 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns, but have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity ability checks.
