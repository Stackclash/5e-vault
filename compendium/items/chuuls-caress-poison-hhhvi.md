# Chuul's Caress Poison
*Poison (injury), uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Poison](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)

This poison can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. While [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the creature is [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.
