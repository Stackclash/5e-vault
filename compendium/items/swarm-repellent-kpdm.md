# Swarm Repellent

- **Cost**: 40 gp

This slimy yellow paste can be smeared over exposed parts of the body to protect against attacks by insect swarms. A swarm of ants, beetles, biting flies, wasps, or similar insects that enters your space while you're protected by swarm repellent must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be unable to attack you. A repelled swarm can repeat this saving throw at the start of its next turn; most swarms prefer to seek out an unprotected target.

A jar of swarm repellent costs 40 gp and holds enough paste to protect two Medium or four Small creatures. Applying the repellent takes 1 minute, so it's not a good option in the middle of combat, but it's effective for 1 hour or until you're immersed in water.
