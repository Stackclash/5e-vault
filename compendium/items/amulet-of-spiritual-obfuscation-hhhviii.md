*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVIII/AmuletofSpiritualObfuscation.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This gold framed amulet has a large red stone in its center, inside of which, is a swirling vortex that resemble souls chasing each other for eternity. The spiritual chaos inside this amulet is capable of masking its wearer's spiritual presence, among other protections. While wearing this amulet, you gain the following benefits:

- You act as if you are under the [nondetection](compendium/spells/nondetection.md) spell.  
- You, and everything you carry, are immune to the effects of [truesight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#truesight). Anything attempting to view you with [truesight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#truesight) simply sees you as if they were using any of their other senses (if any).  
- You cannot be subjected to any magical effect that would attempt to possess your body or remove your soul against your will.  
- Undead, celestials, and fiends have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks to find you, as your chaotic spiritual energy partially masks you from their senses.
