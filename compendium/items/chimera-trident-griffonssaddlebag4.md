This dark silver trident is decorated with the sculpted busts of three creatures: a dragon, a goat, and a lion. Each head gives way to one of the trident's three prongs. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you make a ranged attack using this weapon, it flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to release a fiery breath from the trident's heads in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within that cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:7d6|noform|avg` (`7d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn or until you hit a hostile creature with the trident and roll a 6 or higher on the damage die, whichever comes first.
