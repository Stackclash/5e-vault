# Chain of Entanglement
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVI/ChainofEntanglement.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

You may use this weapon instead of your free hand when you make [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) checks. While you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) this way, you cannot make [attacks](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) with this weapon.

Additionally, while holding this item, you may spend an action to speak this item's command word and throw it into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. At this point, this weapon becomes magically animate and may attack and move freely for the next minute. As a bonus action on your turn, you may either mentally command the chain to move up to 20 feet in any direction or make an attack against a target within 10 feet of it. At the end of the minute or if you drop [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), the chain drops to the ground and this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.

While animate, treat this weapon as if it had 14 Strength and a +2 proficiency bonus for the sake of attack rolls, damage rolls, and grapple checks.
