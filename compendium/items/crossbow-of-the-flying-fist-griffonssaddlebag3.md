The front of this weapon is carved in the likeness of a wooden fist. Crossbow bolts fired from this weapon deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage on a hit (your choice). If you deal bludgeoning damage to a target in this way, the crossbow bolt impacts the target without piercing it, leaving only a sizable welt or bruise behind. When this happens, you can also choose to have a mage hand appear at the target's location, as if you had cast the spell, provided the target was within 30 feet of you. You can use a bonus action immediately after the attack to control the hand.

This version of the [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) spell can be used to punch a target within 5 feet of it whenever you control it, using a spell attack bonus of +5. On a hit, the hand deals 1 force damage.
