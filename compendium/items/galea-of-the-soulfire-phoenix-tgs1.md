# Galea of the Soulfire Phoenix
*Wondrous item, major, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Galea-of-the-Soulfire-Phoenix.webp#right)  


This magical helmet once belonged to the Soulfire Phoenix Fara, a paragon to the citizens of the Elemental Plane of Fire who led her people to victory during the Savrayan Wars. While some believe that her ferocity and heroism were a result of [phoenix](compendium/bestiary/elemental/phoenix-mpmm.md) blood running through her veins, others claim that a hero will always rise from the ashes when the time is right.

A spark of this heroism resides within the helmet, imparting its passion and phoenix-like properties to you. While wearing the helmet, you have resistance to fire damage, and while you're in combat, magical flames erupt from it. The fire is harmless and casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

## Fiery Spirit

While wearing the helmet, you and friendly creatures standing within its bright light have advantage on saving throws against becoming [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). In addition, you and friendly creatures within the bright light regain 1 hit point on a roll of 19 or 20 on death saving throws.

## Ignite

While wearing the helmet, you can use a bonus action to cast the [fire shield](compendium/spells/fire-shield.md) spell (warm shield only) from it, requiring only verbal components. When you do, you also sprout a pair of flaming wings that last for the duration of the spell and give you a flying speed of 30 feet. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Call of the Phoenix

This helm has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d4+3|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the helmet, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it, requiring only verbal components to do so (save DC 18): [death ward](compendium/spells/death-ward.md) (3 charges), [flame strike](compendium/spells/flame-strike.md) (4 charges), or [healing word](compendium/spells/healing-word.md) (2nd-level version, 1 charge; +5 spellcasting ability modifier).

## From the Ashes

If you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright while wearing the helmet, you can use your reaction to call upon the spark of heroism that resides within the galea to drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do, you immediately regain 14 hit points, and each creature within 10 feet of you must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, two flaming wings unfurl from your back and carry you to an unoccupied space of your choice up to 60 feet away from you, without provoking opportunity attacks. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. If you die while attuned to this helmet, it vanishes in a cloud of embers and smoke and reappears somewhere in the Elemental Plane of Fire.

## Random Properties

The Galea of the Soulfire Phoenix has the following random properties:

- 1 [major beneficial property](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md)  
- 2 [minor detrimental properties](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md)  
- 1 [major detrimental property](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties.md)  

## Destroying the Helmet

The only way to destroy the helmet is to feed it to an ancient phoenix. The phoenix dies and is immediately reborn as a result of the intense magic stored within the artifact. When it's reborn, the phoenix has a pronounced crown of golden feathers upon its head. Regardless of how many times it's reborn, the phoenix retains this crown of feathers.
