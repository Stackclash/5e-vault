# Mordenkainen's Mint
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

Named for the famous mage that first discovered them, these arrow shaped mint leaves glow with a pale blue light that fades as soon as they are plucked from their stem. Spellcasters traditionally sew them (stems and all) into the lapels of their clothes and then simply tilt their heads and tear a leaf off with their teeth whenever they need its powers. The sharp flavour of the mint aids concentration and the elimination of distractions, something spellcasters take advantage of in order to maintain the stability of their magic.

## Effect:

As a bonus action, you may begin chewing this herb. While chewing this herb, you have advantage on any Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell. This herb may be chewed for up to 10 minutes, which must be done consecutively.
