# Comet Ballista
*Weapon ([heavy crossbow](compendium/items/heavy-crossbow.md)), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Comet-Ballista.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 B
- **Range**: 100/400
- **Properties**: [Ammunition](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Ammunition), [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Loading](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Loading), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 18.0 lbs.

This crossbow is partially covered in cold shards of stone and metal and uses [sling bullets](compendium/items/sling-bullet.md) as ammunition instead of [crossbow bolts](compendium/items/crossbow-bolt.md). When you fire a sling bullet from this magic crossbow, it flashes with blue light and leaves behind a brief, glimmering trail of cold, sparkling dust. Ranged attacks with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage, instead of piercing damage, and any target hit by it takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage. In addition, the first time you hit a target on each of your turns with a ranged attack using this weapon, each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage.

## Hailing Comets

You can use an action to fire the crossbow into the air and speak its command word, choosing a point that you can see within 120 feet of you when you do. The sling bullet scatters into icy dust and is destroyed, but magically conjures a barrage of miniscule falling comets above the point. The comets fall in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder centered on that point and disappear once they hit the ground. Each creature within the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:8d6|noform|avg` (`8d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
