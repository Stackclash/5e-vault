# Eaglereign
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Eaglereign.webp#right)  


This thick glove is ornamented with eagle feathers and fitted with an enchanted silk lining. You can use the glove to cast the [find familiar](compendium/spells/find-familiar.md) spell as an action instead of its normal casting time. When you do, the familiar takes the form of an [eagle](compendium/bestiary/beast/eagle.md). The familiar disappears if you are no longer attuned to the glove. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

You can focus on the glove for 1 hour to summon a [giant eagle](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-eagle.md) that magically appears in an empty space within 30 feet of you. The giant eagle is considered to be a fey creature and disappears after 12 hours, when it drops to 0 hit points, or if you dismiss it as an action. Once the eagle disappears, it can't be summoned again until 2 days have passed.

The giant eagle is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the giant eagle, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue (no action required). If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no action.

The giant eagle has a carrying capacity of 480 pounds and can fly at up to 8 miles an hour. It must rest 1 hour for every 3 hours it flies, and it can't fly for more than 9 hours.
