This pair of twin scimitars features draconic guards and winglike blades. Despite there being two weapons, they are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. While holding one of the swords, you always know the general direction and distance of the other.

## Chromatic Change

Each of the swords is associated with a damage type: either acid, cold, fire, lightning or poison. Any target hit by one of the scimitars takes an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) damage of its associated type. While one of them is in your hand, you can use a bonus action to change its damage type to a different one. When you do, the color of its metal changes to reflect the new damage type.

## Draconic Riposte

While holding each of the swords in either hand, you can use your reaction when you're hit by a melee attack to gain a +4 bonus to your AC against the triggering attack, potentially causing it to miss you. If the attack misses as a result of this reaction and the attacker is within 5 feet of you, you can immediately make an opportunity attack against the attacker using one of the scimitars.

## Winged Rush

While you're holding the two swords in either hand, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed whenever you take the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action. You lose this speed at the end of your turn, falling if you are in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.
