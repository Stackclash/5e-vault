# Chain of Command
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

While holding this weapon, you may use this weapon to make [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) checks instead of using a free hand. While you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) this way, you can't [attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) with this weapon.

If you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by this weapon, you may spend your action to force that creature to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for 24 hours. While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), the creature obeys your verbal or telepathic commands to the best of its ability. If the creature suffers any harm or receives a command that would be hazardous to itself, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the creature successfully saves against this effect, or if the effect on it ends, it becomes immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

You may only have one creature [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) at a time. If you charm another, the effect on the previous creature ends.
