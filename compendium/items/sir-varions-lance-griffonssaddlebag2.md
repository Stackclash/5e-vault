# Sir Varion's Lance
*Weapon ([lance](compendium/items/lance.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Sir-Varions-Lance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 P
- **Properties**: [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [special](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Special%20Weapons)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This weighty lance was originally designed for Sir Varion, a brave knight with a famous disregard for horses. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has the heavy property, but is uniquely balanced to function well in close-quarters combat. Attacking a target within 5 feet of you with this weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

If you are attuned to [Sir Varion's shield](compendium/items/sir-varions-shield-griffonssaddlebag2.md), you can wield this weapon with one hand, instead of two, while also holding the shield.
