# Wand of Gilding
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, sorcerer, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wand-of-Gilding.webp#right)  


This golden wand is a classic royal family heirloom and has a delicate lily at its end that flowers when held. While holding the wand, you can use the following properties:

## Enhance Beauty

You can use an action to point the wand at a living target you can see within 30 feet of you and magically enhance its beauty for 1 hour. If the target is a creature, its eyelashes may become thicker, its skin more radiant, and its hair more luscious. If it's a plant, it may grow more vibrant, smell more fragrant, and look visibly healthier.

## Gild

As an action, you can touch the wand to a target no larger than 1 foot in any dimension to cause it to appear to be made of gold for 1 hour. Its appearance and texture change to reflect the new appearance, but its weight remains the same. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals that the effect is illusory. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into dirt and is destroyed.

## Spells

While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15): [alter self](compendium/spells/alter-self.md) (Change Appearance only), [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md) (2nd-level version), [enthrall](compendium/spells/enthrall.md), or [hypnotic pattern](compendium/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md).

## Silver Tongue

While holding this wand, when you make a Charisma check or saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend 1 of its charges to make the roll with advantage.
