# Fragments of Chaos
*Wondrous item, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Fragments-of-Chaos.webp#right)  


When found, this necklace has `dice:1d3+2|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) glass beads hanging from it. Each bead contains a small amount of energy from the plane of chaos. While wearing the necklace, you can use an action to wrench off one of the beads and throw it at a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The bead shatters upon impact, and a random effect occurs, centered at that point. Each time you throw a bead, roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) and use the table below to determine what effect occurs (save DC 16).

`dice: [](fragments-of-chaos-griffonssaddlebag4.md#^1-effect)`

| dice: 1d8 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | A dense thicket of trees erupts from the ground in a 20-foot-radius circle. Each creature within the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted 60 feet in the air, up to the space available, as the trees ensnare it and lift it up. Medium and smaller creatures can squeeze between the trees in the thicket; such a creature also has three quarters cover against ranged attacks. The trees vanish after 1 hour. |
| 2 | Shards of volcanic glass explode from the point, slicing and burning creatures within 20 feet of the point. Any creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 slashing damage and 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 3 | A roiling whirlpool replaces the ground in a 20-foot-radius circle. The whirlpool creates its own extradimensional space that's 100 feet deep. Creatures within the area when it appears or who enter it for the first time on their turns must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pulled 10 feet towards the center of the pool and 20 feet down, pulling it towards the bottom of the pool. The area of the whirlpool is also considered difficult terrain, even for creatures that have a swimming speed. The whirlpool rages for 1 hour, after which time the ground returns to normal. Any creatures within the whirlpool when it ends are shunted back to the nearest unoccupied space on the ground. |
| 4 | Lightning strikes out from the point, striking creatures within 20 feet. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature makes the save with disadvantage if it's made of metal or wearing metal armor. A creature takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 5 | The ground within 20 feet of the point of impact turns into quicksand. The sand extends 60 feet down from the point, creating a cylinder of quicksand, or until it reaches an open space below. As such, a creature can sink into the quicksand and fall into a room below it. A creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns or sink 10 feet into the sand; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw. If it moves, it moves 1 foot through the area for every 5 feet of movement it spends. A creature in the sand can move horizontally or vertically in this way. The ground returns to normal after 1 hour. |
| 6 | A sudden blizzard is released from the point of impact. The blizzard creates a 20-foot-radius cylinder of hail that's 60 feet tall (up to the available space). The area within the blizzard is heavily obscured and slick with ice, making it difficult terrain. A creature that moves into the blizzard for the first time on its turn or that starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 cold damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage damage and isn't knocked prone. The blizzard dissipates after 1 hour; a moderate or stronger gust of wind disperses the blizzard early. |
| 7 | A cloud of choking ash fills the air in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The cloud moves around corners and heavily obscures the area. A creature that enters the cloud for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 poison damage and begins to suffocate. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison damage and doesn't suffocate. A suffocating creature can't speak and must spend its action coughing and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. The cloud dissipates after 1 hour; a moderate or stronger gust of wind disperses the cloud early. |
| 8 | Roll two d8s, rerolling any 8s, and choose which order to apply the resulting effects from this table in. |
^1-effect
