# Hide of the Wild Guardian
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement by a druid)*

This well-worn gray bearskin cloak has been passed down from druid to druid for generations. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

You gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.

You can use your Wild Shape feature up to three times between rests, instead of twice, unless you can already use it more.

The maximum challenge rating beast you can transform into with your Wild Shape increases by 1.

While transformed into a beast, you gain a +3 bonus to AC, as well as to attack and damage rolls with natural weapons, even if the cloak merges into your new form.
