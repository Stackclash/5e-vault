# Charlatan's Wardrobe
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Charlatans-Wardrobe.webp#right)  


This set of plain clothes is exceptionally comfortable and easy to wear. They are always clean and smell freshly washed and lightly perfumed. You can change the appearance of the outfit as an action by twirling in place and speaking the clothes' command word. The outfit's appearance is illusory. Physical interaction with the clothes reveals their appearance to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the clothes can determine that it is an illusion with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Regardless of their appearance, the clothes offer no additional protection from the elements, and can only appear to be clothes.
