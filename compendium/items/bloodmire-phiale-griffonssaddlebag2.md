# Bloodmire Phiale
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bloodmire-Phiale.webp#right)  


This shallow, ceramic drinking bowl is enchanted to repurpose spilled blood into new life. The bowl holds up to 8 ounces of blood. Once filled, the blood begins to slowly swirl on its own. If left to sit for 1 hour without spilling, the blood in the bowl becomes a gruesome tonic that pulses with a faint, internal glow.

Drinking the entire bowl of still blood causes one of two effects. Roll a `dice:d12|noform|avg` (`d12`). On a 12, you take 12 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you are stable. On a roll of 11 or lower, you instead regain a number of hit points equal 4 + the number rolled. The blood is thick and sweet, but leaves a bitter aftertaste.

The blood's magic fades if it's poured from the bowl without being drunk. Once the bowl has been used in this way, it can't be used again until `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) days have passed.
