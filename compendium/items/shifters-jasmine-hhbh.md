# Shifter's Jasmine
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

A jasmine flower with a pearlescent lustre that changes colour with the light. When burnt and inhaled as incense, this highly sought after but incredibly rare herb is able to completely change one's body based on the user's own mental image. These plants have a strong presence in the culture of changelings who believe that they were the result of an ancient civil war amongst their people, with the flowers growing wherever their blood was spilled.

## Effect:

While preparing this herb, you must mentally picture a humanoid form. This form does not need to share the same race, sex, dimensions, or age as your current one, but must be within the realistic bounds for a humanoid of that race (e.g. you cannot picture a 12 foot tall dwarf or an elf with four arms). After using the herb, your body permanently changes to match the form you pictured. Your stats do not change, and you keep all racial abilities you had originally.
