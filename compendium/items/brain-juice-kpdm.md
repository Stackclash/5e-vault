# Brain Juice
*Potion, very rare*  


This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures such as [aboleths](compendium/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md). Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the drinker is infused with magical power and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended spell slots. On a failed save, the drinker is afflicted with a form of [short-term madness](compendium/tables/short-term-madness.md) lasting for 1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws, it gains a form of [long-term madness](compendium/tables/long-term-madness.md) permanently and automatically fails all further saving throws brought about by drinking brain juice.
