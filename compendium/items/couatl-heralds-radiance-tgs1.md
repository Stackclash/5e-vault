# Couatl Herald's Radiance
*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster of good alignment)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Couatl-Heralds-Radiance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic wooden staff was enchanted by a powerful [couatl](compendium/bestiary/celestial/couatl.md). The staff has 5 charges. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spellcasting ability modifier and spell save DC: [create food and water](compendium/spells/create-food-and-water.md), [cure wounds](compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md) (2nd-level version), [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [protection from poison](compendium/spells/protection-from-poison.md), [sanctuary](compendium/spells/sanctuary.md), or [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md).

The staff regains `dice:1d3+2|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.

## Flight of the Couatls

While you're attuned to 3 items with this property, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, your flying speed increases by 30 feet instead.
