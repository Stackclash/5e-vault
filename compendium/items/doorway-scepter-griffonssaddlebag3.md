# Doorway Scepter
*Rod, minor, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Doorway-Scepter.webp#right)  


A silver and brass door knocker hangs from the top of this rod. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast either the [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md), [knock](compendium/spells/knock.md), or [passwall](compendium/spells/passwall.md) spell from it. Once a spell has been cast in this way, that spell can't be cast from the rod again until the next dawn.

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to minimize and transform the rod into a lockpick, which functions as a set of [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) and grants a +2 bonus to any ability check you make that uses it. The rod remains in this form until you use a bonus action to return it to its normal form or until you're no longer holding it.
