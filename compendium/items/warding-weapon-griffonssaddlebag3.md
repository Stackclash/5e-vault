# Warding Weapon
*Major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Warding-Weapon.webp#right)  


You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which is inlaid with Celestial runes of ivory.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to speak its command word and slam it onto the ground at a point within 5 feet of you. When you do, a holy warding beacon erupts from the ground, centered on that point. The beacon is a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder. The beacon lasts for 1 minute and sheds bright light from its edge in a 20-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is sunlight. For the duration, any creature within the cylinder is considered to have half cover against ranged attacks. Friendly creatures within the area when it appears gain 15 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute. Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
