# Great Owl's Staff
*Staff, weapon, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Great-Owls-Staff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

While holding this staff, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear.

The staff has 5 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [darkvision](compendium/spells/darkvision.md) (2 charges), [enhance ability](compendium/spells/enhance-ability.md) (2 charges; "owl's wisdom" only), or [vicious mockery](compendium/spells/vicious-mockery.md) (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level).

The staff regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff vanishes in a puff of downy feathers and is destroyed.
