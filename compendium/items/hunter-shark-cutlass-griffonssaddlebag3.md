- **Damage**: 1d6 S

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The blade of this sword is carved from the tooth of a giant shark. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If the target is a creature that's missing any of its hit points, it takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) slashing damage from the attack. You have advantage on any Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check made to track a creature you've hit with the sword within the last hour.

In addition, while the sword is on your person, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and can breathe underwater. Further, sharks are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
