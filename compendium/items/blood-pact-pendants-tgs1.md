# Blood Pact Pendants
*Wondrous item, major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Blood-Pact-Pendants.webp#right)  


These iron pendants come in pairs and are connected by a powerful bond of self-sacrifice. In order to create this bond, you and a friendly creature with whom you are close perform a brief, 1-minute ritual to connect your destinies and forge a blood pact. When you create this blood pact, you must each agree on a number of hit points to permanently sacrifice and reduce your total maximum hit points by (minimum 1). Once a pact has been forged, trickles of the bound creatures' blood are absorbed into the normally clear gems adorning the faces of these pendants. While the gem is filled in this way, it seems to gently swirl and pulse in time with your heartbeat.

While the bound creatures are wearing their respective pendants and are on the same plane of existence, they're protected by this pact so long as one creature is still conscious. When a bound creature dies, it's immediately revived with `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) hit points plus twice the number of hit points it had sacrificed. When a creature is revived in this way, the other bound creature immediately falls to 0 hit points and is knocked [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), ending the blood pact and restoring both creatures' hit point maximums to normal. This property ignores any effect that would normally prevent a creature from falling to 0 hit points. Once the pact is ended in this way, the gems and pendants crack and are no longer magical.
