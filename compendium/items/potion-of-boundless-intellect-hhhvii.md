When you drink this potion, your Intelligence score increases to 21 if it was lower than that before, and you gain proficiency in the [History](/compendium/rules/skills.md#History), [Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [Nature](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Nature), [Religion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Religion), and [Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation) skills if you were not proficient in them before. This effect lasts for 24 hours, after which you suffer 2 levels of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) as your brain attempts to process the mental surge it just experienced. This potion is a dull grey color with chunks of partly solidified matter floating in it.
