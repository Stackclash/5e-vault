# Sea Serpent Hairpin
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Sea-Serpent-Hairpin.webp#right)  


This golden, twisting hair pin wraps around a tiny silver sword and gives your fingers and skin a slight grip while underwater. While wearing this pin, you have advantage on Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks you make in order to grapple another creature while you are either submerged or swimming in water.
