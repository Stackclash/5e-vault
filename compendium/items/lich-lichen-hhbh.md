# Lich Lichen
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A pale white lichen resembling bone dust, found growing in dark areas of extreme desolation like battle sites or dark magical rituals. It carries a peculiar odour reminiscent of a mummified corpse that has been known to both attract carrion as well as mask one's presence from the undead. The term "ghostwalker" has arisen in some cultures to refer to individuals that cover themselves in powders made from this lichen and are thus able to walk through legions of the undead as if they were taking a stroll through a leafy lane.

## Effect:

After using this herb, any creatures with the undead creature type have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to detect you.
