While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a damage die of `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`).

## Curse

Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
