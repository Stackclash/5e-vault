# Basilisk Tongues
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A plant with drooping purple-grey flowers, resembling those of a basilisk's tongue. Indeed, the resemblance is more than superficial, as the petals secrete a magical oil that can transform flesh into stone much like its namesake's gaze. It has long been debated as to whether this is a mere coincidence, or if perhaps the basilisk gained its signature ability through a long coexistence with the plant. Unfortunately, no conclusive evidence has so far been found.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition, covering it in a petrifying oil for 10 minutes. A creature hit by this weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or gain one level of the following effects as they begin to turn to stone. The affected creature's movement speed is halved. The affected creature is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). The affected creature is [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) as it turns to stone. The creature may make the Constitution saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, reducing their effect level by one on a success. A [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic cast on an affected creature instantly removes all levels.
