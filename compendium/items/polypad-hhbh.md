# Polypad
*Herb, unknown (magic), Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

These massive colonies of coral grow on top of floating platforms of seaweed, creating something that resembles a lilypad on the ocean covered in mineral growths. Most polypads have existed for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and it is believed by some that they were spawned on the border between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Water. Coastal tribes have been found to keep pieces of polypads, calling upon its energy to conjure elemental servants to protect them in times of emergencies.

## Effect:

After using this herb, you conjure a [water elemental](compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) and an [earth elemental](compendium/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of you. The elementals disappear when they drop to 0 hit points or after 4 hours, whichever comes first. The elementals are friendly to you and your companions and act on their own initiative orders. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to an elemental, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.
