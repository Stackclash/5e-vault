# Wand of Confusion
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This wand has 4 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md) spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 4th-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you spend.

The wand regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
