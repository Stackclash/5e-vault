# Wavebender's Leiomano
*Weapon ([glaive](compendium/items/glaive.md)), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Wavebenders-Leiomano.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)

This long wooden oar is ornamented with burnt designs and has a line of shark teeth along its edge. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the leiomano, you can use an action to cast the [control water](compendium/spells/control-water.md) spell (*Redirect Flow* only) from it. The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the weapon. Once the weapon's been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

In addition, if you use this weapon as an oar when rowing a ship, that ship's rowing speed is increased by 5 feet for each wavebender's leiomano being used to row it.
