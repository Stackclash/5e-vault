# Whiffwater Potion
*Potion, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Whiffwater-Potion.webp#right)  


This small glass bottle is in the shape of a nose. The potion inside is a tasteless, gelatinous goo. When you use an action to drink the potion, your breath becomes visible for 1 hour. During that time, you can change what color your breath appears to be. In addition, when you describe a smell using sensory language, your breath's smell changes to reflect the smell you're describing.

If a described smell would normally cause a creature to retch or have a magical property (such as the [stinking cloud](compendium/spells/stinking-cloud.md) spell or hezrou's Stench trait), your breath has a smell reminiscent of such an effect, but is otherwise harmless.
