# Headband of the Sweatless
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Headband-of-the-Sweatless.webp#right)  


These vibrant silk headbands come in a variety of colors and patterns. While wearing the headband, you magically don't get wet when you perspire, but are still naturally cooled as if you had. In addition, the first time you make a Constitution saving throw to resist the effects of extreme heat, add `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) to the total of the roll. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
