# Bloodhunter's Lens
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this crimson monocle lens, you may activate it by spending your action to speak its command word. While activated, the blood of all creatures within 60 feet of you appear as an extremely bright, red light. You can see this blood even if it is fully obstructed (such as from being within a creature's body or behind a wall), in darkness, or [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible). You may deactivate the lens at any time by speaking its command word again as an action.

The lens can be activated for 1 hour, all at once or in smaller increments, using a minimum of 1 minute each time it is activated. The lens regains 10 minutes of use for every 6 hours it is not in use.
