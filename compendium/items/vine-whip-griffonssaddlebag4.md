Tightly braided living vines have been rooted to the end of a branch to make this magic whip. The whip adds 10 feet to your reach when you attack with it, instead of 5 feet; if you're a druid or ranger, it instead adds 20 feet to your reach. If you're a druid, you're proficient with the vine whip. This whip can be targeted by the [shillelagh](compendium/spells/shillelagh.md) spell.

When you hit a Large or smaller target with the whip, you can choose to pull it up to 10 feet towards you, or 20 feet if you're a druid or ranger. Unless you're a druid, this property of the whip can't be used again until the next dawn.
