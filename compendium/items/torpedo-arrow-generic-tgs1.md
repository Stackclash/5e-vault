# Torpedo Arrow (Generic)
*Minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Torpedo-Arrow.webp#right)  


This unique arrow's spiraling design allows it to travel unimpaired in the water. When firing this arrow underwater, you ignore the normal disadvantages of underwater fighting. When you fire this weapon out of water, the normal and long ranges of the arrow are halved.
