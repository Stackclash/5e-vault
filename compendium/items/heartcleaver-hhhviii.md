# Heartcleaver
*Weapon ([greataxe](compendium/items/greataxe.md)), cursed item, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d12 S
- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items), [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

The exact details differ when describe how [Baphomet](compendium/bestiary/npc/baphomet-mpmm.md) came to own the mighty greataxe, Heartcleaver. Some say he claimed it after slaying the previous Demon Lord that held his seat; others say he stole it from Muradin's forge and as punishment was cursed with his current form; while still others say that he made it himself, quenched in the rivers of boiling blood that run through the Abyss. Regardless of its actual origin, it is agreed by the few lucky enough to survive an encounter with it, that Heartcleaver is one of the most dangerous weapons to have ever been created.

To attune to Heartcleaver, you must kill a humanoid without using any tools or weapons, and then drive Heartcleaver through that humanoid's recently deceased heart. Once attuned to Heartcleaver, your appearance becomes more beast-like as you grow shaggy hair over most of your body, your teeth become sharper and more prominent, and your nails transform into claws. You may use these teeth and claws as natural weapons for making unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. These physical changes remain even if you lose attunement to Heartcleaver, but your teeth and claws can no longer be used to make unarmed strikes. If you are no longer attuned to Heartcleaver, a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell, [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, or similar magic cast on you will revert you to your original appearance.

## Magic Weapon

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, this weapon is considered to have the reach property.

## Random Properties

Heartcleaver has the following randomly determined properties:

- 2 [major beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) properties  
- 1 [major detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties.md) property  
- 2 [minor detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) properties  

## Charge

If you move at least 10 feet straight toward a target before immediately hitting with a melee weapon attack, the target takes an extra `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

## Labyrinthine Recall

While attuned to Heartcleaver, you can perfectly recall any path you have travelled, and you are immune to the [maze](compendium/spells/maze.md) spell.

## Predator's Rampage

If you kill a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use your bonus action to move up to your speed in the direction of a hostile creature. You do not provoke [opportunity attacks](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) during this movement. At the end of your movement, if a hostile creature is within your reach, you may make a melee weapon attack against that creature as a part of your bonus action.

## Spellcasting

Using Heartcleaver, you may cast the [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md), [dominate beast](compendium/spells/dominate-beast.md), [hunter's mark](compendium/spells/hunters-mark.md), and [maze](compendium/spells/maze.md) spells once a day. All casting of these spells are done at their lowest level. If you are attuned to the either the artifact [Helm of the Horned King](compendium/items/helm-of-the-horned-king-hhhviii.md) or the artifact Talisman of the Prince of Beasts ^[This source of this item cannot be discerened and it is deemed to be missing fom this document.], you may cast these spells one level higher than their lowest. If you are attuned to both of these items as well as the Heartcleaver, you may cast all of these spells two levels higher than their lowest level. All uses of spells are recovered upon the next dawn.

## Curse

As the weapon of a Demon Lord, Heartcleaver bares a lingering curse for any mortal that attunes to it. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be overcome by a primal urge to hunt. While overcome in this way, you become obsessed with seeking out a living creature to hunt and kill, regardless of whether that creature is a friend or foe. This urge does not end until you have killed a creature and eaten its heart. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to Heartcleaver and end the urge immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current urge. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must make the saving throw after your next long rest as usual.

## Destroying Heartcleaver

The only way to destroy Heartcleaver is to build a labyrinth around it that measures no less than 10 miles in diameter. If Heartcleaver is left completely untouched and unattuned for 100 years at the centre of this labyrinth, it corrodes into a useless hunk of rust and loses all power. Be warned though, that such labyrinths will naturally attract the attention of monsters such as [minotaurs](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md), as well as mortals seeking the hidden treasure inside. If Heartcleaver is disturbed during the 100 years, it must be moved, a new labyrinth built around it, and the process must begin again.
