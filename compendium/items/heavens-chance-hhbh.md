# Heaven's Chance
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

An unquestionably magical herb found only on remote mountainsides, untouched by general society. With a checkered pattern resembling that of the fritallary but burnished with a radiant gold colour, this herb is believed to have been created directly by the gods as a method to test their faithful, and to push the boundaries of fate that even they are beholden to. Indeed, burning this herb and inhaling the resulting smoke results in a feeling of pure euphoria and otherworldly power that manifests as breaking through limits that would otherwise be impossible.

## Effect:

Whenever you roll the maximum value on a damage dice, you may reroll that dice and add the new result to your total damage dealt, repeating this process if you roll the maximum value again. There is no limit to the number of times you may do this on a single instance of damage.
