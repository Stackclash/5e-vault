# Coil Crook
*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Coil-Crook.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This smooth red staff is actually made from a rigid length of rope. You can speak the staff's command word as a bonus action to cause it to magically loosen and turn into a 10-foot length of decorative [silken rope](compendium/items/silk-rope-50-feet.md). You can speak the staff's command word again as a bonus action to cause the rope to untangle itself and become the solid staff form once more. It can be used as a spellcasting focus in either of these forms.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the [rope trick](compendium/spells/rope-trick.md) spell from it, using it as the rope required for the spell. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
