![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mourningsteel-Half-Plate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 15 + Dex modifier (max of +2)

- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

This dark armor has been made from mourningsteel, a metal refined from ore found beneath the battlefields of particularly vicious wars. Steeped in the blood from relentless battles, this metal carries with it a magical aversion to all things holy. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to radiant damage. While you wear it, you gain the following benefits:

## Death Transference

Whenever you are subjected to necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage and instead gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dusk.

## Spells

You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from the armor: [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md), [divine word](compendium/spells/divine-word.md), or [nondetection](compendium/spells/nondetection.md). Once the armor has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dusk.

## The Battlefield Remembers

You can use an action to touch a weapon, piece of armor, or similar object that's seen blood and battle to recreate the effect of the [legend lore](compendium/spells/legend-lore.md) spell, using the touched object as the subject of the effect. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

## Unholy Aura

As a bonus action, you can speak the armor's command word to surround yourself with an aura of grim blasphemy. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you are [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or die. For the duration, celestials have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and the first time that a celestial moves within 5 feet of you on its turn or starts its turn there, that creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) necrotic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. In addition, once before the aura ends, if you fail a saving throw against an effect from a celestial (such as a [solar](compendium/bestiary/celestial/solar.md)'s Slaying Longbow), you can choose to succeed instead. Once the aura ends, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
