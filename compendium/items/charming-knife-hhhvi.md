As an action, you may speak this weapon's command word to activate its ability for the next minute. While this dagger's ability is active, any damage it deals to a creature that is [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you does not count as damaging it or doing anything harmful to it for the sake of potentially ending the [charm effect](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed). Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
