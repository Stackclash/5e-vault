# Nithing Pole
*Wondrous item, rare*  


A nithing pole is crafted to exact retribution for an act ofcowardice or dishonor. It is a sturdy wooden staff, 6 to 10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored target of the staff's curse. The carved shaft is draped in horsehide, topped with a horse's skull, and placed where its target is expected to pass by; typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot, where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late.

A pole is created to punish a certain person for a specific crime. The target must be named on the pole; a description such as "the person who blinded Lars Gustafson" isn't precise enough. The moment the target approaches within 60 feet, the pole casts [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md) (with a range of 60 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. On a successful save, the pole recasts the spell every round until the target's saving throw is a failure, the target retreats out of range, or the nithing pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down a nithing pole is also targeted by a [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md) spell, but only once.

You determine the effect of the curse when the pole is created. The pole becomes nonmagical only after it has laid its curse on its intended target; an untriggered and forgotten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries. The curse, once activated, lasts for 8 hours and doesn't require concentration.
