# Eclipse Spear
*Weapon ([spear](compendium/items/spear.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Eclipse-Spear.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 P
  - Two-handed: 1d8 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown), [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

When in moonlight, this magic spear casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. This spear pierces through darkness to find its marks, allowing the attacks you make with it against targets obscured by magical darkness to be made without the disadvantage normally imposed by magical darkness. Attacks made with this weapon deal either piercing or slashing damage (your choice).

In addition, while holding the spear, you can use a bonus action to cast the [branding smite](compendium/spells/branding-smite.md) spell from it. Once cast in this way, this property can't be used again until the next dusk.
