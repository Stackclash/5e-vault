# Mindwipe Lenses
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

These lenses have 10 charges. While wearing and attuned to these lenses, you may expend those charges to do any of the following.

## Devil's Sight

You may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to enhance your vision with fiendish energy. For the next hour, you have [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet, and magical darkness doesn't impede your vision.

## Spellcasting

You may spend your action and a number of charges to cast any of the following spells: [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md) (1 charge), [command](compendium/spells/command.md) (1 charge), [dominate person](compendium/spells/dominate-person.md) (5 charges), [dominate monster](compendium/spells/dominate-monster.md) (8 charges), [feeblemind](compendium/spells/feeblemind.md) (9 charges). These spells are cast using your spell save DC. If you do not have one, the DC is set to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.

## Poison Mind

You may use an action to expend 3 charges to target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you or expend 5 charges to target two creatures instead. Targeted creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:4d12|noform|avg` (`4d12`) necrotic damage and be [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the start of your next turn.

## Forgetfulness

You may use an action to expend 4 charges to target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or become [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 minute. A [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours.

These lenses recover all expended charges daily at dawn.
