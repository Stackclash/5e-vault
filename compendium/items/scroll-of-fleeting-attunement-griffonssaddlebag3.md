# Scroll of Fleeting Attunement
*Scroll, minor, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scroll-of-Fleeting-Attunement.webp#right)  


You can use an action to read this gilded scroll. To do so, you must also be holding a magic item that requires attunement but with which you're not attuned. When you do, make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. The DC of this check depends on the rarity of the held magic item: 10 (common), 13 (uncommon), 15 (rare), or 16 (very rare). On a success, you forge a brief attunement to the magic item, which remains for 1 hour or until you're reduced to 0 hit points. You can attune to an item in this way even if you normally wouldn't meet its attunement requirements, and becoming attuned to it doesn't end any other creature's attunement to it. Your attunement to this item does not count toward the total number of items you can normally be attuned to. The scroll then self-immolates in a sparkle of blue flames and is destroyed. If you fail the check to attune to an item in this way, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that the scroll self-immolates. Otherwise, you can attempt to use the scroll to attune to the item using another action.

The check automatically fails if you attempt to attune to a legendary magic item, a cursed one, or an artifact using the scroll.
