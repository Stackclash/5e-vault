# Ring of Solar's Sight
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Ring-of-Solars-Sight.webp#right)  


This gilded ring has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [hunter's mark](compendium/spells/hunters-mark.md) spell from it, which lasts for 1 minute. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls made against any target you mark with the spell in this way, and on a hit, the attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage type.
