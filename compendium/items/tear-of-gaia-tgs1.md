# Tear of Gaia
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Tear-of-Gaia.webp#right)  


As an action, you can crush this small, green gem underfoot to activate its magic. Plants within a 10-foot radius of you immediately become healthy and full. Fruit and vegetable-bearing plants begin to grow their produce, which grow ripe over the course of 1 hour. If there are no plants within range or you crush the gem against an inorganic material, fertile topsoil 1 inch deep spreads across the area. Healthy green grass immediately grows from the new soil.
