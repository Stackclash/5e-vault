# Ice Sickle
*Weapon ([sickle](compendium/items/sickle.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ice-Sickle.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magic sickle from the Everglacier is perpetually covered in tiny, needle-like icicles along its edge that reform almost as soon as they're gone. The first target hit by this weapon on each of your turns takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage from the attack.

> *"Really? You're going to name it that?"*
