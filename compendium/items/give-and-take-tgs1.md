# Give and Take
*Weapon ([scimitar](compendium/items/scimitar.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Give-and-Take.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This pair of mithral *(Give)* and obsidian *(Take)* scimitars are connected by a sturdy chain. When you engage in two-weapon fighting using both scimitars, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

The scimitars have a collective 10 charges and regain `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at midday. When you hit a creature with one of these magic weapons, you can expend 1 of their charges to create an effect based on the blade used in the attack:

## Give

When you hit a creature with *Give* and expend 1 charge, you and all other creatures within 5 feet of the target (other than the target) gain `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) temporary hit points that last for 1 minute.

## Take

When you hit a creature with *Take* and expend 1 charge, that creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage, and you and all other creatures within 5 feet of the target take half as much necrotic damage.
