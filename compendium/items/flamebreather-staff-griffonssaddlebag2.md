# Flamebreather Staff
*Weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Flamebreather-Staff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This red, hollow quarterstaff releases a plume of fire when spun. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) fire damage.

In addition, while holding the quarterstaff, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to release a gout of flame from its end, duplicating the effect of the [burning hands](compendium/spells/burning-hands.md) spell (save DC 13). This property of the quarterstaff can't be used again until the next dawn.
