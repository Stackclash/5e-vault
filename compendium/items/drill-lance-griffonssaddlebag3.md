# Drill Lance
*Weapon ([lance](compendium/items/lance.md)), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Drill-Lance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 P
- **Properties**: [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [special](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Special%20Weapons)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a hit, the lance's point whirs as it rapidly spins. When you attack a creature or object made of stone or wood with this magic lance and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

## Overcharge

The lance magically stores your movement into its own, spinning faster as you charge forward. Once per turn, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then attack it with the lance on the same turn, the weapon releases a superheated line of energy from it in the direction of the target. The line is 15 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage. If the triggering attack also hits, this fire damage is in addition to the weapon's damage against the target.
