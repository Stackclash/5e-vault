# Stylus of Draconic Influence
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This stylus has 8 charges. While holding this stylus, you may spend 1 minute and a number of charges to cast the [glyph of warding](compendium/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) spell, choosing the Spell Glyph option and infusing it with a spell chosen from the following list: [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md) (1 charge), [fear](compendium/spells/fear.md) (3 charges), [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md) (4 charges), [dominate person](compendium/spells/dominate-person.md) (5 charges), [mass suggestion](compendium/spells/mass-suggestion.md) (6 charges). All spells are cast at their lowest possible level and all spells use your spell save DC. If you do not have a spell save DC, the DC is set to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.

This item recovers `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) charges at dawn. If you use the last charge, there is a 10 percent chance that it crumbles into dust and becomes useless.
