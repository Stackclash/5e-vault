# Sword of the Spelldrinker
*Weapon ([longsword](compendium/items/longsword.md)), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Sword-of-the-Spelldrinker.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This sword seems to absorb any light that touches it, making it appear darker than the deepest midnight. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you hold this sword, you treat any magical light, darkness, or atmospheric effect within 30 feet of you as if it were nonmagical and breathable.

In addition, this sword has 2 charges and regains `dice:1d2|noform|avg` (`1d2`) expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the sword, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [counterspell](compendium/spells/counterspell.md) spell (5th-level version) from it. If you successfully interrupt a spell in this way, you can choose to absorb it into the sword instead of countering it. If the triggering spell was cast at 6th level or higher, your *counterspell* automatically fails. The absorbed spell must have a casting time of one action or bonus action. The sword can have only one absorbed spell at a time.

You can use an action while holding the sword to release an absorbed spell. When you do, the spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell.

The interrupted spell remains absorbed by the sword for up to 8 hours or until released. Absorbing a new spell replaces the one stored within the sword.
