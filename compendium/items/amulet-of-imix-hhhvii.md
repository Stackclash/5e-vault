# Amulet of Imix
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain 5 temporary hit points whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points. In addition, any time you are forced to roll a Constitution saving throw to maintain control of a fire elemental or maintain concentration on a spell that deals fire damage, you do so at advantage.
