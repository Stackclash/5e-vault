# Devil-Beating Brush
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Devil-Beating-Brush.webp#right)  


Many temple murals depicting great gods and deities have been painted by artists wielding devil-beating brushes, which are blessed by divine magic. While the brush is being held, a constant stream of paint coats its pegasus-hair tip. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to change the paint's color. You gain a +5 bonus to any ability check you make with the brush to paint. The paintbrush counts as a set of [painter's supplies](compendium/items/painters-supplies.md).

You can use an action to paint on a devil. Make a Dexterity or Charisma check using the paintbrush against the devil's AC. On a success, the devil takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) radiant damage. If you roll a 20 on the ability check, the devil must also succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to its home plane of existence, unless it's already there.
