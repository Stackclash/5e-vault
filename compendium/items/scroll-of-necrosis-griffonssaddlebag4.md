# Scroll of Necrosis
*Scroll, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Scroll-of-Necrosis.webp#right)  


The parchment of this scroll feels meat-like and is wrapped around a set of bones. You can use an action to read this grisly scroll aloud, causing nearby creatures to become plagued by necrotic magic. Each creature that can hear you within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become cursed. A creature cursed in this way has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls using Strength, and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with disadvantage; the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage and ending the curse on itself on a success.

Undead creatures that hear the curse make the saving throw with disadvantage. If an undead creature fails the saving throw and has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower, it falls apart into a heap of rotting carnage and is destroyed.

When the last word of the scroll is read aloud, the parchment sloughs off the bones and is destroyed, leaving only an unidentifiable mush behind.
