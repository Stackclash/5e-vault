- **Damage**: 1d10 P
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) expended charges daily at dusk. While holding this pike, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md) (1 charge), [phantom steed](compendium/spells/phantom-steed.md) (1 charge), [speak with dead](compendium/spells/speak-with-dead.md) (1 charge), or [spirit guardians](compendium/spells/spirit-guardians.md) (2 charges).

## Spectral Warrior

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this pike, you can choose to summon a spectral warrior from the weapon. Until the start of your next turn, that creature is haunted by the warrior. While haunted, a creature has disadvantage on weapon attacks against you. This property has no effect against undead creatures.

## Haunting Phalanx

You can use an action while holding this pike to expend 3 of its charges and point it forward commandingly. Five spectral, pike-wielding warriors appear before you and march in a 25-foot by 50-foot line in a direction you choose. Any creature within that line's area must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) necrotic damage and `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) psychic damage and is affected by the weapon's *spectral warrior* property. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't affected by the spectral warriors. Undead creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw.
