- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)

You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. As a bonus action, you may cause the stinger on the end of this whip to exude a noxious poison. The next creature you successfully hit with this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). While [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the target is also [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used this ability cannot be used again until you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack.
