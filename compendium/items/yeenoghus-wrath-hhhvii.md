# Yeenoghu's Wrath
*Melee Weapon, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVII/YeenoghusWrath.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. As a bonus action, you may cause the stinger on the end of this whip to exude a noxious poison. The next creature you successfully hit with this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). While [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, the target is also [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used this ability cannot be used again until you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack.
