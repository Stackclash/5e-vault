# Mummy Rot Juice
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

A noxious potion brewed from the corpse dust of a mummy. It carries much of the lethal mummy rot that the cursed creatures are known for. This potion has a murky brown colour and smells roughly like an opened tomb; however, the smell can be covered easily enough with an overpowering scent.

When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. While cursed, you cannot regain hit points, and your hit point maximum decreases by `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces your hit point maximum to 0, you die, and your body turns to dust. This curse lasts until removed by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or other magic.
