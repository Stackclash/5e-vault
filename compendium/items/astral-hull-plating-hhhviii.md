# Astral Hull Plating
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

> [!note]
> This item is also available as a Astral Hull Plating.

This hard plating is surprisingly light, buoyant, and specially tuned to the Astral Plane, allowing ships outfitted with it to sail through that Astral Sea with little effort.

A ship that has been appropriately outfitted by this plating gains a +1 bonus to AC and may sail through the Astral Plane as if it were water. Piloting and sailing the ship like normal allows it to travel as if it were subjected to an average travel wind on the Material Plane, and it moves at the appropriate speed. The ship may also angle itself up or down to achieve the same freedom of movement that creatures enjoy on the Astral Plane; doing so only requires the helmsman of the ship to concentrate on the angle change as they steer.

For a ship to be considered appropriately outfitted, two scales are required for every 10 feet of ship length: one on each side.
