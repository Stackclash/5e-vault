# Stunning Lens
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this item, as an action, you may target a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If it can see you, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the start of its next turn. Once this ability has been used once, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
