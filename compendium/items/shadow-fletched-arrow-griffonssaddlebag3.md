# Shadow-Fletched Arrow
*Ammunition ([arrow](compendium/items/arrow.md)), minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Shadow-Fletched-Arrow.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

This arrow is barbed with unforgiving spikes and releases a plume of magical shadow when shot. When a creature is hit by the arrow, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature's Strength score is reduced by `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) for 1 hour on a failed save, or by half as much on a successful one. This effect can't reduce a creature's Strength score below 6. The arrow then becomes nonmagical.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as shadow-fletched bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
