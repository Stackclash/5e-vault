# Frostburn Blade
*Major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mirrorlight-Stinger.webp#right)  


This sword's blade is made entirely of ice and remains perfectly frozen regardless of temperature. A single flame licks at the ice from above the weapon's hilt. While holding the sword, the fire expands to cover the weapon's edge with flame, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage and `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage.

When you take the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action using this weapon, you can choose to forgo one of the attacks to sweep the blade in front of you, causing a wave of either cold or fire to erupt from the blade in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) cold or fire damage (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
