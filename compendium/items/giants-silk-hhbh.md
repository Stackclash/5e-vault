# Giant's Silk
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

Although they appear to be massive vines, these tendril-like herbs are actually the roots of ancient trees that once grew before the shifting of landmasses caused them to die off. Although they look like they are made of stone, they are actually incredibly light and flexible, making them very useful as cabling for the hard-working adventurer.

## Effect:

This herb may be used in place of 60 feet of rope. You make any Strength ability checks at advantage when using this rope to perform any pushing, pulling, lifting, or climbing.
