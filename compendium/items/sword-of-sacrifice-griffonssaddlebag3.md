# Sword of Sacrifice
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Sword-of-Sacrifice.webp#right)  


You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you take the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can forgo one of your attacks to wound yourself with the sword instead. When you do, you take `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) necrotic damage, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Then, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature becomes cursed by the sword for 1 minute or until your [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) ends (as if [concentrating](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell). The curse ends early if you end one of your subsequent turns without attacking the creature with the sword. Whenever you hit the cursed creature with the sword, it takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage from the attack. If you slay a cursed creature with the sword, you regain `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) hit points. Dying doesn't end your attunement to the sword.

## Sacrifice

As an action, or when you're reduced to 0 hit points (no action required), you can use the sword to end your life in an act of total sacrifice. When you do, you are killed outright, but the sword becomes a [dancing sword](compendium/items/dancing-sword.md) that you magically control on your initiative count, as if you were alive and not [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). The sword uses your attack bonus and ability modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and it has a +1 bonus to those rolls. The sword drops to the ground next to you and becomes a normal sword of sacrifice after 1 minute or if you're returned to life. Making more than four attacks with the [dancing sword](compendium/items/dancing-sword.md) doesn't end the effect early. The sword deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage to any target it hits for the duration. Once you've used this property of the sword, you can't do so again.
