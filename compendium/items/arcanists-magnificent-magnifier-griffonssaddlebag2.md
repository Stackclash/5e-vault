# Arcanist's Magnificent Magnifier
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*

This magical magnifying glass helps deduce the arcane nature of items. While looking through the glass at an object within 1 foot of you, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check you make regarding that object's magical properties. In addition, you can speak the glass's command word as an action to cast the [identify](compendium/spells/identify.md) spell from it, targeting an object with the spell that you can see through the glass within 1 foot of you. Each time you do, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance that the glass shatters and is destroyed after casting the spell.
