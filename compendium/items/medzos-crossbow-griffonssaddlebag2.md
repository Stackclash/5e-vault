This crossbow once belonged to a savage gambler. Scoring a critical hit with this magic weapon doesn't double the weapon's damage dice, and when you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with it, the weapon jams and can't be used again until the end of your next turn.

A target hit with a ranged attack from this crossbow takes `dice:3d4|noform|avg` (`3d4`) piercing damage, instead of its normal damage. When you hit with an attack using this weapon and roll three of the same number on its damage dice, use the matching number to determine what effect occurs using the table below. When this happens, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage.

| Matching Number | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | You can reroll one of the weapon's damage dice, even if it was a matching number. You must use the new roll. |
| 2 | The next attack roll made against the target before the end of your next turn has advantage. |
| 3 | The target has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes until the end of your next turn. |
| 4 | If the target is a hostile creature, 30gp magically appears at your feet. |
