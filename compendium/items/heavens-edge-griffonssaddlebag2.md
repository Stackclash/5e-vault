# Heaven's Edge
*Weapon ([dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md)), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Heavens-Edge.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This ornate dagger is made of multiple pieces that magically hover together, but move as if they were solidly connected. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) radiant damage to any creature it hits. This extra damage increases to `dice:4d4|noform|avg` (`4d4`) radiant damage if the creature is a fiend or undead.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a fiend, the target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is banished, as if by the [banishment](compendium/spells/banishment.md) spell. This version of the spell doesn't require concentration but ends early if you become [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or die within the next minute. On a successful save, the creature is [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the start of your next turn and isn't banished.
