# Soul-Searing Scythe
*Weapon ([halberd](compendium/items/halberd.md)), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Soul-Searing-Scythe.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This brass weapon was forged in the heart of the Elemental Plane of Fire. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the scythe, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing soul-rending flames to erupt from the holes in the blade. These flames are harmless to you and shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the scythe.

While the scythe is ablaze, it deals an extra `dice:3d4|noform|avg` (`3d4`) fire damage to any target it hits. This damage ignores fire resistance and immunity, and it becomes necrotic damage when it hits a creature with the Fire Absorption trait.

In addition, when you score a critical hit with this weapon against a creature that is not a construct or undead, the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:3d4|noform|avg` (`3d4`) necrotic damage and is [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much necrotic damage and isn't [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, its body and soul are immolated and destroyed unless it is a construct or undead. A creature whose body and soul have been destroyed by the soul-searing scythe can be restored to life only by a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention.
