# Shamisen of the Changing Winds
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Shamisen-of-the-Changing-Winds.webp#right)  


This shamisen has a tiny cherry tree growing along its base. When played, the tree's leaves rustle in a magical breeze. You must be proficient with a string instrument to use this shamisen.

You can use an action to play the instrument and release a flurry of cutting wind from it. When you do, you can choose to make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 60 feet of you, using your spell attack bonus, as part of that action. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) + your Charisma modifier.

When you score a critical hit with a ranged attack using the shamisen, make a Charisma ([Performance](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check using the instrument. If the total of the roll exceeds the target's AC, the target is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until the end of your next turn, as it's transfixed by the music. A [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) creature or creature that can't hear is immune to this effect.

Whenever you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, you can magically change the instrument's tuning. Whenever you use an action to play the instrument, you also gain a benefit associated with its tuning, which lasts until the end of your next turn. Alternatively, you can spend 1 minute to retune the instrument. When found, the instrument is set to a random tuning.

## Honchoshi

While set to this tuning, the summoned wind swirls around you in a protective breeze, granting you a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks.

## Ni Agari

While set to this tuning, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

## San Sagari

While set to this tuning, your spell attacks with the shamisen score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

Alternatively, you can spend at least 1 minute playing the instrument. When you do, the air around you in a 40-foot radius grows still. The atmosphere within that area becomes comfortable and dry (regardless of the weather), and any creature that isn't [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) and can hear the instrument that starts its turn within the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature is indifferent about targets of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the creature is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. The effect lasts until you move, stop playing, or lose [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) (as if [concentrating](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell). When the effect ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise. A creature is immune to this effect if it can't be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed). Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
