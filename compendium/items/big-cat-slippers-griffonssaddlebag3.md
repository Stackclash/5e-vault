# Big Cat Slippers
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Big-Cat-Slippers.webp#right)  


These slippers come in pairs of one of four patterns. Each pattern resembles a type of cat found in a different environment. While wearing the slippers, you gain a benefit determined by their pattern.

| Pattern | Appearance | Benefit |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Arctic | All white and silver with leopard spots | Difficult terrain caused by snow and ice doesn't slow your movement and can't cause you to fall prone. |
| Jungle | Orange and white with black stripes | You gain a +3 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks in heavily forested areas. |
| Mountain | A mix of brown, tan, and white | You gain a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed, and it increases by 10 feet when climbing on cliffs and other natural rock surfaces. |
| Savannah | Dull yellow with cheetah spots | You can move an extra 10 feet when you take the Dash action. |
