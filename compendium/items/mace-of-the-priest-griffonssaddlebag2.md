# Mace of the Priest
*Weapon ([mace](compendium/items/mace.md)), major, rare (requires attunement by a cleric)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mace-of-the-Priest.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic mace is carried by priests and is a symbol of their devotion to ridding the world of evil. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to adjust its telescoping haft, changing it from a [mace](compendium/items/mace.md) to a [quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md), and vice versa. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast either [cure wounds](compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md) (3rd-level version) or [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier.

Alternatively, you can use an action to speak the weapon's command word to cast the [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md) spell from it. When you do, the weapon releases a flash of light and is destroyed.
