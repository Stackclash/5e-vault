# Attack-In-The-Box
*Weapon ([flail](compendium/items/flail.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Attack-In-The-Box.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

A colorful box sits at the top of this weapon's wooden handle. Within the box is a coiled spring beneath the flail's spiked head. The head springs out from the box the first time you make an attack with it, granting you advantage on the attack roll and creating a random effect. Roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) and refer to the table below to determine the effect. You can use an action to stuff the head back into the box, or use a bonus action to cause the head to harmlessly spring from it.

`dice: [](attack-in-the-box-griffonssaddlebag3.md#^effect)`

| dice: d6 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The target is covered with magical confetti and can't benefit from being invisible for 1 minute. On a hit, the target's face is also covered with the confetti, causing any attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn to be made with disadvantage. The confetti vanishes after 1 round. |
| 2 | The head is replaced with a comical boxing glove. On a hit, the target takes the weapon's damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. The head then returns to normal. |
| 3 | The box erupts with a chorus of music. You gain a d6. You can choose to roll the die and add the result to any ability check or attack roll you make in the next minute. When you do, the die is lost. |
| 4 | On a hit, the target must also succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the hideous laughter spell. This version of the spell ends at the start of your next turn or when the creature takes any damage. |
| 5 | A second flail head springs from the box after the first. You can use a bonus action immediately after the attack to make one additional attack with the flail against the same target. On a hit, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. The head then returns to normal. |
| 6 | The flail's head is comically large. On a hit, the target takes an extra 6 bludgeoning damage. The head then returns to normal. |
