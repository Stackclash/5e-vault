# Circlet of the Sharpened Mind
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement by a creature with an Intelligence score of 17 or higher)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Circlet-of-the-Sharpened-Mind.webp#right)  


This iron circlet has a magical pearl at its center and can hold up to 4 gemstones. When found, the circlet has 2 gemstones. A gemstone worth at least 5,000 gp can be added to the circlet over the course of 1 minute as it's magically drawn and fastened into place. While wearing the circlet, you can take a special [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn to summon a number of floating, spectral swords equal to the number of gemstones in the circlet and make one melee spell attack with each of them against a target within 10 feet of you. You are proficient with these attacks and use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for them. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) + your Intelligence modifier. The swords appear at your side and remain there until you dismiss them as a bonus action or until you fall [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) or remove the circlet. While the swords are summoned, you can take this special [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action once on each of your turns. The spectral swords shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

You can replace one of these melee spell attacks with a weapon attack as part of this special Attack action. If you're able to make multiple attacks when you take the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can instead replace a number of these spell attacks up to the number of weapon attacks that you can normally make as part of the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action.

When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to make one melee spell attack with one of the summoned swords against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.
