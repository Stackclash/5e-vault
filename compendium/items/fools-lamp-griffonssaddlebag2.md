# Fool's Lamp
*Wondrous item, major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Fools-Lamp.webp#right)  


This brass lamp is decorated with flowing patterns around a blue, glass chamber at its center. Swirling, magenta clouds drift within the lamp and billow eagerly whenever it's held. Created as a grim sculpture by a spiteful djinni, this lamp offers no benefit to those foolish enough to encounter it.

An [identify](compendium/spells/identify.md) or [legend lore](compendium/spells/legend-lore.md) spell correctly reveals the lamp to be empty, as well as its true nature. However, identifying the lamp by any other means will reveal that the lamp has a [djinni](compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) trapped inside it, allowing it to function as a [ring of djinni summoning](compendium/items/ring-of-djinni-summoning.md) while held and without requiring attunement. It also reveals that the only way to summon the djinni is to ask it for a wish (such as a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell or general command), treating the wish as a command phrase.

When a creature holding the lamp speaks such a phrase using an action, the GM uses the table below to choose the outcome or determine it randomly:

`dice: [](fools-lamp-griffonssaddlebag2.md#^effect)`

| dice: d10 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | You're shunted to a harmless demiplane inside the lamp for 1 hour, during which time you can see as if you were in the lamp's space, but are otherwise [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened). At the end of each of your turns while you're in the demiplane, you can make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, ending the effect early on a success. At the end of the duration, you return to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the lamp. |
| 2 | A [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) (5th-level version, save DC 16) erupts, centered on you. |
| 3 | You're unintelligible for `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`) hours, during which time you only speak in nonsensical sounds. |
| 4 | You're under the effect of the [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md) spell for 24 hours. |
| 5 | A hostile [air](compendium/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) (40%), [earth](compendium/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) (20%), [fire](compendium/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) (20%), or [water](compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) (20%) elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. |
| 6 | Your legs become unstable for `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) hours, during which time you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws, and if you move your full speed on a turn, you must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity check or fall [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). |
| 7 | You're affected by the [levitate](compendium/spells/levitate.md) spell for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, flip a coin and roll a `dice:d4\|noform\|avg` (`d4`). If it's heads, you float up a number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled on the `dice:d4\|noform\|avg` (`d4`). If it's tails, you float down the same number of feet. |
| 8 | You are under the effect of the [suggestion](compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spell for `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) hours. If you are asked to do something that isn't harmful, accompanied by the word "please" or a similar phrase, you are compelled to obey. |
| 9 | You age 1d10 years, taking 5 necrotic damage for each year that you age in this way. Your age returns to normal when you finish a long rest. |
| 10 | Roll twice on the table and use both effects, rerolling any 10s. |
^effect

If a creature affected by the lamp is targeted by the [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic, one of the lamp's effects on the creature ends.
