# Flight of Fancy Fascinator
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Flight-of-Fancy-Fascinator.webp#right)  


This raven-feathered hat is decorated with a silvery net, which drapes fashionably across your face when worn. While you're wearing it, any beast or monstrosity that has a flying speed must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw whenever it makes a melee attack roll against you. On a failure, the creature makes the attack roll with disadvantage. If the attack still hits, it deals no damage, but the creature steals the hat from your head. When this happens, the creature becomes [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the hat for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. For the duration, the creature is entirely focused on the hat; it can only take the [Dodge](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dodge) or [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action on each of its turns.

Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it's immune to the hat's effects for the next 24 hours.
