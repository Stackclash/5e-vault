# Amulet of the Ocean Lord
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This item has 9 charges. While wearing this amulet, you may spend an action and 1 or more charges to do any of the following:

- You may cast any of the following spells without requiring any components or spell slots: [conjure elemental](compendium/spells/conjure-elemental.md) (1 charge, water elementals only), [chain lightning](compendium/spells/chain-lightning.md) (1 charge), [tsunami](compendium/spells/tsunami.md) (2 charges), or [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) (2 charges). These spells use your spell DC. If you do not have one, the DC is equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.  
- For the next hour, any aquatic creature within 6 miles of you that has an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you and aggressive towards targets of your choosing. These creatures understand verbal commands you give them, and you telepathically understand basic ideas and images from them while they are within 30 feet of you (1 charge).  
- While you are submerged in water, you may emit a magical pulse that allows you to sense the distance, direction, and shape of any solid object and creature that are both within 1 mile of you and within the same body of water as you (1 charge).  

This item regains `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) charges daily at dawn.
