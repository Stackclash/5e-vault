![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Sandstorm-Dancer.webp#right)  


This golden cloak billows illusory sand around you when you walk or cast a spell. The cloak has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the cloak, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it (save DC 15): [blur](compendium/spells/blur.md) (2 charges), [call lightning](compendium/spells/call-lightning.md) (3 charges), [create or destroy water](compendium/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md) (1 charge), or [hallucinatory terrain](compendium/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) (4 charges).
