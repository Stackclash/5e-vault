This chitinous, two-pronged weapon still shudders with predatory instinct, magically biting down on creatures it hits. Once on each of your turns when you hit a Medium or smaller creature with this magic bident with a melee attack, you can force that creature to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by you and is held in place by the weapon. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from this grapple on a success. You can't use the weapon to attack another target while it's grappling a creature in this way, but you can choose to deal `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage to the [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) creature automatically in place of any attack you'd make with it as part of the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, as the weapon's pincers clamp down tightly around the target.

You can release a creature from the bident's grapple on your turn (no action required). The weapon releases a creature from its grasp early if you let go of the weapon or are [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).
