This magic chain shirt is crafted using strange wooden links enchanted by a militant circle of druids. The wooden chain is reinforced with old, natural magic that responds to the wearer's reverent connection to nature. While wearing this armor, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom modifier (max 2) in addition to the armor's normal AC.
