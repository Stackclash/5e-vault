# Ring of the Soul Harvest
*Ring, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Ring-of-the-Soul-Harvest.webp#right)  


This ring has a design of a sickle and wheat at the top. Reversing the ring shows a design of longboats sailing toward a sunset, representing the afterlife. While wearing the ring, you regain 1 hit point whenever a Small or larger hostile creature is slain within 30 feet of you, provided that you're not [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and the creature isn't a construct or undead. You can't regain more than 1 hit point per turn in this way.
