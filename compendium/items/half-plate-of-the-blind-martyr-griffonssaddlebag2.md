![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Half-Plate-of-the-Blind-Martyr.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 15 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

This dark, battle-scarred half plate armor honors the blind valkyrie, a twisted symbol of impartial war, justice, and repentance. You gain a +2 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

## Charges

This armor has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d4+4|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 4`) expended charges daily at midday. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC, spellcasting ability modifier, and spell attack bonus:

- 1 charge: [cure wounds](compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md), [inflict wounds](compendium/spells/inflict-wounds.md)  
- 2 charges: [blindness/deafness](compendium/spells/blindness-deafness.md), [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md)  
- 3 charges: [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md), [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md)  
- 4 charges: [banishment](compendium/spells/banishment.md), [death ward](compendium/spells/death-ward.md)  
- 5 charges: [contagion](compendium/spells/contagion.md), [mass cure wounds](compendium/spells/mass-cure-wounds.md)  
- 6 charges: [harm](compendium/spells/harm.md), [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md)  

## Curse

This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. This curse can only be removed by a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell or similar magic, removing the armor fails to end the curse. While you're cursed, you are [blind](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), but have [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) out to a range of 60 feet while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with an attack or cast a spell that affects a creature other than yourself, you take 3 psychic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity
