# Reap and Sew
*Weapon ([light crossbow](compendium/items/light-crossbow.md)), cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Reap-and-Sew.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 O
- **Range**: 80/320
- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to the weapon, you can cast the [mending](compendium/spells/mending.md) cantrip at will. A special, needle-like bolt is magically bound to the crossbow. When fired, the bolt leaves a faint thread of arcane energy behind it and deals force damage instead of piercing. The bolt returns to the crossbow and loads itself after each attack, ignoring the crossbow's normal loading property.

The crossbow has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges each day at dawn. When you fire the special bolt from this crossbow and hit a Large or smaller creature, you can expend 1 charge to tether that creature to a point on the ground adjacent to it. If the creature attempts to move more than 10 feet away from that point before the end of its next turn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

If the special bolt is somehow destroyed or lost, the bolt reappears loaded in the crossbow after 24 hours. The weapon is considered to be a mundane, nonmagical crossbow while separated from the bolt for longer than 1 minute.

## Curse

Once attuned to this weapon, you must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw whenever you attempt to take a short or long rest. On a failure, you are overcome with the urge to craft and are forced to sew, knit, crochet, or crossstitch feverishly for at least 1 hour before being able to rest. The curse remains even if the attunement ends, but can be undone by any effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell.
