# Bird of a Feather (common)
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bird-of-a-Feather.webp#right)  


This small stuffed roc toy is filled with enchanted down. While holding onto the toy and concentrating, you magically gain a flying speed of 20 feet for up to 1 minute. The stuffed toy's weak magic can carry up to 200 pounds.

If you take any damage while flying in this way, you lose concentration on the toy and immediately start falling.

The common variant of this item is single-use, becoming mundane once the magic has been expended.
