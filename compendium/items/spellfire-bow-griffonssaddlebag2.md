This richly polished wooden longbow is ornamented with a silver trim and bowstring. Even if you aren't attuned to the bow, it creates a special arcane arrow when you draw it back without nocking one. When you fire the bow using one of these arcane arrows, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals force damage instead of piercing damage.

If you're attuned to the bow, you are proficient with it and can use it as a spellcasting focus. While holding the weapon, you gain a +3 bonus to any ranged spell attack you make, as the spell is launched through the bow. When you do, you perform any somatic component for the spell by drawing the bow. In addition, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that has a range of 5 feet or greater, its range increases by 30 feet.
