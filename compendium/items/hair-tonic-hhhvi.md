# Hair Tonic
*Potion, common*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you massage this tonic into a patch of skin for 1 minute, that patch of skin experiences extremely rapid hair growth, even if hair growth in that area is not usually possible. Each day for the next 7 days, roll `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`). You grow that many inches in hair over the course of the day in that area.

This bottle has enough hair tonic to cover 10 square feet of skin.
