# Ringmaster's Top Hat
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Ringmasters-Top-Hat.webp#right)  


This colorful top hat carries a perpetual air of revelry and frivolity with it. While wearing the hat, you can use an action to cast the [thaumaturgy](compendium/spells/thaumaturgy.md) spell from it, and you have proficiency with whips.

While wearing the hat, you can use an action to turn [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), disappearing into a cloud of smoke when you do. The cloud heavily obscures the space you vanished from, and it remains there until the start of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When you vanish in this way, you magically teleport to another space that you can see within 30 feet of you. You remain [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the start of your next turn or until you make an attack or cast a spell. Once this property of the hat has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
