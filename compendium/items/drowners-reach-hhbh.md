# Drowner's Reach
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A horrible variety of sargassum in which each leaf resembles the pale, twisted fingers of a drowned corpse. Even beyond its sinister appearance, these leaves display a rather morbid ability to trap all manner of tiny sea life using the tiny, hair-like cilia that covers its entire being. As the creatures decompose, this plant absorbs nutrients from its body, allowing it to grow quickly despite its lack of supporting root structure.

## Effect:

While you have this herb wrapped around a free hand, you have advantage on any [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) checks made with that hand. Wrapping and unwrapping this herb around a free hand takes an action. Once this herb has been used in 5 successful [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) checks, it deteriorates and becomes useless.
