# Grip of Dendallen
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Grip-of-Dendallen.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

These black leather and bone chain gloves spread sickness and decay to anything they touch. While wearing the gloves, your unarmed strikes deal necrotic damage, and you can roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes. This damage is maximized if you hit a plant or plant creature with the attack.

In addition, while wearing the gloves, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from them (save DC 16, spell attack bonus +8): [blight](compendium/spells/blight.md), [contagion](compendium/spells/contagion.md), or [vampiric touch](compendium/spells/vampiric-touch.md). Casting *blight* in this way uses a range of touch, instead of its normal range. Once the gloves have been used to cast a spell, they can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dusk.

## Curse

When you pull these gloves over your hands for the first time, make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you are aware of the curse's effects and can immediately remove the gloves before they extend it to you. On a failure, the gloves' bone chains pierce your skin and latch onto the bone in your arms. You take `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) piercing damage and can't remove the gloves unless you're targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. While you wear the gloves, the flesh on your hands slowly rots. The stench can't be contained or masked through magical or nonmagical means. While your hands rot in this way, you make Charisma checks with disadvantage and take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage whenever you finish a long rest.

If you fail the saving throw when first donning the gloves and later remove them, it takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) days for the effects of the rotting flesh to fade.
