# Paralyzing Dust
*Wondrous item, poison (inhaled or ingested), uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Poison](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)

You may spend an action to blow this pouch of grey dust into the face of a non-undead creature within 5 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 minute. That creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

If this dust is dissolved into a liquid first and then drunk by a non-undead creature, they automatically fail the save and all subsequent saves for the next minute.
