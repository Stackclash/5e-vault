# Leeching Lash
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Leeching-Lash.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The head of this whip is split into two leech-like heads, each complete with a set of barbed teeth. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a creature with an attack using this whip, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) necrotic damage. If you took damage from a hostile source since the start of your last turn and hit a creature with the whip, you regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, up to the damage you took. You can't regain hit points in this way more than once per turn. If the creature is a construct, ooze, or undead, you don't regain any hit points in this way.
