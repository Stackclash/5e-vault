- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magical lyre's strings reverberate with enchantment magic when you tell lies, allowing you to deceive other creatures more easily. You have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks you make when you spend at least 1 minute attempting to convince a creature of a lie. In addition, if you cast the [vicious mockery](compendium/spells/vicious-mockery.md) cantrip while holding the lyre, the spell save DC is increased by 1. You are proficient with this lyre while you're attuned to it.
