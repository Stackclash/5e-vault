# Camouflage Cloak
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

You may cover yourself with this cloak as a free action while pressing yourself flat against a hard, uniformly colored surface. If you do so, your cloak changes to match the color of the surface you are pressed against, giving you advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks you make while remaining motionless against this surface.
