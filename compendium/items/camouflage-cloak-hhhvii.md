# Camouflage Cloak
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

You may cover yourself with this cloak as a free action while pressing yourself flat against a hard, uniformly colored surface. If you do so, your cloak changes to match the color of the surface you are pressed against, giving you advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks you make while remaining motionless against this surface.
