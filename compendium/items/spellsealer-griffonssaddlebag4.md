# Spellsealer
*Weapon ([war pick](compendium/items/war-pick.md)), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Spellsealer.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This wicked war pick has been used to destroy a powerful wizard's spellbook. The weapon's surface is marked with abjuration wards to contain malevolent spellcraft. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Once per turn when you hit a creature with the war pick, you can choose to use either its Read or Seal property.

## Read

You magically know the names of `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) different spells that the creature can cast; these are chosen at random by the GM, skipping any that you've already learned using this property.

## Seal

You magically prevent the target from casting a spell you name until the start of your next turn. If the creature attempts to cast the spell, it must first make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature casts the spell. On a failure, the spell fails, and the action is wasted. Regardless of whether it succeeds or fails, the creature then takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage.
