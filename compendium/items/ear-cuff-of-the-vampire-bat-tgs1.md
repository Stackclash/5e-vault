# Ear Cuff of the Vampire Bat
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ear-Cuff-of-the-Vampire-Bat.webp#right)  


While wearing this ceramic bat ear cuff, you can mentally command the cuff (no action required) to enhance your hearing when you make a Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to listen. When you do, the bat's eyes flash with a red glow as its ceramic fangs bite down on your ear. You take `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) necrotic damage from the bite and immediately gain a bonus to your listening Wisdom (Perception) check equal to the amount of necrotic damage you took in this way. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. You can decide to use this ability after you roll the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`), but before the GM determines the outcome.
