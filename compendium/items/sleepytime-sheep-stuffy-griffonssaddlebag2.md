# Sleepytime Sheep Stuffy
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Sleepytime-Sheep-Stuffy.webp#right)  


This small, soft stuffed sheep toy is 6 inches from head to tail and smells like lavender. A willing creature holding the stuffy can use an action to speak its command word to immediately fall asleep. This property can't be used again for 8 hours.
