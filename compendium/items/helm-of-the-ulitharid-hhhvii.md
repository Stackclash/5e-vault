# Helm of the Ulitharid
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this helm, you have telepathy out to a range of 120 feet. In addition, you may spend an action to magically emit psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take `dice: 4d12|avg` (`4d12`) psychic damage and be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

While wearing this helm you also mentally receive duplicates of any messages sent or received via telepathy by creatures within 30 feet of you. The original sender and receiver are not made aware of this interception, and you cannot telepathically respond to a duplicated telepathic message.
