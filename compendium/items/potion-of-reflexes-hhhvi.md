# Potion of Reflexes
*Potion, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, you gain one reaction on every turn in a combat. This effect lasts for 1 minute, after which you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). This potion is completely clear except for one cloudy grey portion that darts around in the liquid towards anything holding the bottle.
