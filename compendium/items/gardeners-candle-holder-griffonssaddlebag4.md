# Gardener's Candle Holder
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Gardeners-Candle-Holder.webp#right)  


This candle holder magically changes the light of burning candles into light that's ideal for plants. While a mundane candle is burning within the holder, the radius of its bright and dim light is doubled, and it loses only 1 minute of burn time for every 8 minutes it's lit. Plants grow twice as quickly as those in normal sunlight while they're within the light of a candle burning in the holder.
