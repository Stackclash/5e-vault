# Bracelet of the Shattered Aegis
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Bracelet-of-the-Shattered-Aegis.webp#right)  


A smoldering, defensive insignia burns at the center of the cracked glass sphere that rests atop this woven bracelet. The bracelet has 2 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If the bracelet has at least 1 charge, you gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing it.

While wearing the bracelet, you can expend 1 of its charges as a reaction when a friendly creature that you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack. That creature gains a bonus to its AC equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum +1) until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack, as a shimmering, magical barrier protects it from harm. If the creature is already under the effect of the [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md) spell, this property has no effect, and the charge is wasted. If an attacker hits the creature while it's protected by this barrier, the barrier shatters, and any hostile creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the barrier shatters, the creature loses this bonus to its AC.
