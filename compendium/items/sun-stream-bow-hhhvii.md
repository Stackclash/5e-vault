# Sun Stream Bow
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  


This bow does not require any physical arrows to be loaded in order to make an attack; instead, whenever its string is drawn back, a Sun Arrow made of solid light is formed in the wielder's pull hand which dissipates after either 6 seconds, or when it hits a solid object, whichever comes first.

Sun Arrows deal an additional `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) radiant damage upon a successful hit and leave a trail of sunlight behind them as they fly through the air. This trail of sunlight illuminates everything in a 5-foot radius around it in bright light and dissipates at the start of the wielder's next turn. The sunlight created by these arrows is considered equivalent to a 3rd level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical darkness.
