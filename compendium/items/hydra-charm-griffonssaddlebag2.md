# Hydra Charm
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Hydra-Charm.webp#right)  


This golden talisman is made of five twisting hydra heads and hung from a simple gold chain. While wearing this talisman, you gain the following benefits:

- When you use your reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can make a second attack against that same target as part of that reaction.  
- You can make an opportunity attack, even if you've already used your reaction.  
- When you are forced to make a saving throw against being [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned), or knocked [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), you can use your reaction to make the saving throw with advantage.  
- When you take more than 25 damage from a single attack or effect, you can use your reaction to regain 10 hit points. If this damage would reduce you to 0 hit points but not kill you outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead and do not regain 10 hit points.  
- When your head would be cut off by an effect, such as by a [vorpal sword](compendium/items/vorpal-sword.md), you can use your reaction to negate the effect.  

Once a benefit of the talisman has been used, that benefit can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
