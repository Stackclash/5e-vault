- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This oddly shaped trident is made of hammered mithral and has a strangely short handle. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon can't be wielded with two hands. When you throw this trident, the forked end of the weapon magically splits apart to form three separate spears: allowing you to make 3 attacks with it instead of 1. After the attack, the trident regrows its missing prongs from one of the separated spears, and the other two spears dissolve.
