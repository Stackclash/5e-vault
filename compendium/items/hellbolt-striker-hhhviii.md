# Hellbolt Striker
*Very rare*  


You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. This weapon is lined with a fiendish coil designed to release stored energy once it is charged by a particularly powerful strike. When you make a successful critical hit against a creature with this weapon, up to three other creatures of your choice within 30 feet of your target that you can see must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw as an arc of lightning streaks from the original target towards them. Creatures take `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
