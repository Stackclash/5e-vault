# Gut Rot
*Potion, common, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with the disease [gut rot](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#gut%20rot). While afflicted with [gut rot](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#gut%20rot), any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer `dice: 4|avg` (`4`) necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with [gut rot](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#gut%20rot), a [violet fungus](compendium/bestiary/plant/violet-fungus.md) sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) days.
