# Gut Rot
*Potion, common*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with the disease [gut rot](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Gut%20Rot). While afflicted with [gut rot](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Gut%20Rot), any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer `dice:4|noform|avg` (`4`) necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with [gut rot](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Gut%20Rot), a [violet fungus](compendium/bestiary/plant/violet-fungus.md) sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) days.
