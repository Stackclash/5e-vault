# Scroll of the Skyfallen
*Scroll, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scroll-of-the-Skyfallen.webp#right)  


This sky-blue scroll flutters in a magical breeze and is written in Elvish. Faraway clouds can be seen floating in the background of its parchment and magically sputter into existence upon reaching the edge. Miniscule birds soar through the clouds, both on the paper and off.

By using an action to read this scroll, your words ring out to magically rip the wind out from beneath the wings of creatures around you. Any hovering, levitating, or otherwise flying creature within 120 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A flying creature falls to the ground on a failed save, and its flying speed is reduced to 0 for 1 minute. On a successful save, any flying speed it has (or similar means of flight) is halved for 1 minute instead. If the creature was levitating or can hover, the creature safely descends at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground instead. A creature with legendary actions is unaffected by the scroll. The scroll then vanishes in a plume of vapor, and is destroyed.
