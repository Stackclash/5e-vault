# Bloody Marilith (Very Rare)
*Potion, minor, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bloody-Marilith.webp#right)  


The following [bloody marilith](compendium/items/bloody-marilith-griffonssaddlebag2.md) is a very rare variant with more powerful properties. It uses blood from a fiendish marilith, instead of a magical substitute, and pleasantly burns your tongue when drinking it. It also tastes better.

When you drink this potion, you can take one reaction on every turn in a combat for 1 minute. Unlike its [common](compendium/items/bloody-marilith-common-griffonssaddlebag2.md) variant, this potion's effect does not end when you use an additional reaction.

Drinking additional [bloody mariliths](compendium/items/bloody-marilith-griffonssaddlebag2.md) before you finish a long rest leaves your body feeling worn. When the potion's effect ends, you can't move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you.
