# Firemelon
*Herb, spellcasting focus, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

Despite the rather silly name, the firemelon is a rather powerful and inherently magical herb, coveted by desert-dwelling societies as a portent of good fortune, and it is common to find them firmly attached to the heads of their staves. In some myths, the orange, hand-sized melon is said to be the seeds of the sun itself, lending all of its heat and energy to the mage that wields it.

## Effect:

You may use this herb as an [arcane focus](compendium/items/arcane-focus.md) when casting your spells. While this herb is your [arcane focus](compendium/items/arcane-focus.md), whenever you roll a 1 or a 2 for fire damage that results from a spell you cast, you can reroll that die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
