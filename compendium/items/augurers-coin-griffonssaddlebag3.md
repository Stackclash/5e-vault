# Augurer's Coin
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Augurers-Coin.webp#right)  


This triangular coin depicts a fair-faced goddess on one side, representing "weal," and a grim specter on the other, representing "woe." "Weal and Woe" is written in Common along the coin's topmost edge.

You can use an action to flip the coin and hold a question in your mind, allowing the coin to hit the ground when it falls. The coin then duplicates the effect of the [augury](compendium/spells/augury.md) spell. Depending on the outcome of the spell, the coin lands in one of the following orientations:

- If the coin lands with either the goddess or specter facing you, the answer to your question is "weal" or "woe," depending on the shown face.  
- If "Weal and Woe" is facing you, the answer to your question is "weal and woe."  
- If the coin lands upright on its edge, the answer is "nothing" instead.  

Each time you flip the coin, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1 or lower, the coin shatters and is destroyed. The maximum number that needs to be rolled to destroy the coin in this way increases by 1 each time the coin is flipped after the first. When found, the coin has already been flipped `dice:1d4-1|noform|avg` (`1d4 - 1`) times.
