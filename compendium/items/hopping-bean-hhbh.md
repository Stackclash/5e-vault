# Hopping Bean
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

Easily identified by their striking red exterior, these thumb-sized beans are filled with gases that heat up and then expand under the harsh desert sun. When this happens, the beans proceed to "hop", propelling them a short distance before cooling down and then doing it again soon after. It is believed that this is their main method of propagation as it allows them to be noticed by passing scavengers and then brought to more fertile areas. That said, if the gases within are inhaled, they cause a strange transformation in which the body is lightened, allowing one to leap long distances without any increase in leg strength.

## Effect:

As an action, you may crack open this herb and inhale the gases within. If you do so, your jump distance is tripled for the next hour.
