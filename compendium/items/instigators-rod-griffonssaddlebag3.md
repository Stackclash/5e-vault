# Instigator's Rod
*Rod, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Instigators-Rod.webp#right)  


This rod looks like a normal torch with a brazier made of four metal prongs. While holding the rod, you can use an action to speak either of its two command words.

The first command word causes the torch's brazier to sputter and ignite, creating a small magical flame at its center. The lit torch sheds as much light as a normal torch. Using an action to speak the command word again extinguishes the light.

The second command word causes the rod to transform into a pitchfork, which functions as a magic trident. Using an action to speak the command word again returns the rod to its normal torch form. If the torch was lit when you first spoke this command word, it's extinguished as part of the transformation.

When you make an ability check to intimidate or coerce a creature while holding the rod, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of other creatures within 15 feet of you who are also holding an instigator's rod, up to a maximum bonus of +5. Once you benefit from this bonus, neither you nor any other creature that was involved in determining the bonus of that check can benefit from an instigator's rod again in this way for 24 hours.
