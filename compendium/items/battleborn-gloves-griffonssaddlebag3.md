*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*

- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

These gloves have been worn by generations of great warriors and bear the marks and remembrances of their prowess. While wearing the gloves, your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2 (your choice), up to a maximum of 22. Alternatively, you can increase both your Strength and Dexterity scores by 1. You make this decision when you first attune to the gloves.

The gloves have 10 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more of their charges for the following properties.

## Fighting Style Master

You can use an action to expend 1 charge to gain one Fighting Style option of your choice from the fighter class. If you already have a style, the one you choose must be different. You can use this property to gain up to two Fighting styles; if you use it to choose a third style, it replaces one of the other two (your choice which one). Runes that line the metal cuffs of the gloves indicate which Fighting Styles you've chosen.

## Single-Handed

You can expend 3 of the glove's charges as a bonus action to temporarily bolster your might: you can wield a two-handed weapon with one hand instead for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to make a single attack with a weapon you're wielding with one hand.

## Warrior's Spirit

If you are a fighter, you can expend 2 charges (no action required) to regain a use of your Action Surge or Second Wind feature. Once you do, you can't regain another use of that feature with this property again until you finish a long rest.

The gloves regain all expended charges when you finish a long rest. When this happens, any Fighting Style you gained with them is lost until you expend a charge to select it again. If you use the last charge from the gloves, make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).

## Sentience

The battleborn gloves are a sentient lawful neutral item with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 15. They have hearing and [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The gloves communicate telepathically with their wearer and can speak, read, and understand Common. When the gloves communicate, they speak with a chorus of voices from countless warriors past. While you are attuned to them, the battleborn gloves also understand every language you know.

## Personality

The battleborn gloves are inhabited by the souls of battle from the fallen warriors who once wore the gloves. They share stories, tactics, and skills with the wearer in order to feel a semblance of life even after death.

As a result, the gloves will gently urge the wearer into combat. The longer it's been since they've been in battle, the less gentle the gloves become with their chiding. To the gloves, it doesn't matter if a battle ends in death; it only seeks the thrill of clashing willpower and strength found in combat. If left without battle for long enough, the gloves may prevent the wearer from using their properties.

## Curse

These gloves are cursed, and attuning to them extends that curse to you. You remain cursed until you're targeted by a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic. While cursed, you refuse to remove the gloves, and if you die while wearing them, your soul is immediately drawn into the gloves to join the chorus of other warriors within them. If your body is targeted by a [revivify](compendium/spells/revivify.md) spell or similar magic, you must make a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. On a success, your spirit escapes the gloves' trapped warriors, allowing the magic to resurrect you. On a failure, the spell fails, your spirit is drawn further into the gloves, and the escape DC increases by 5, up to a maximum of 30.
