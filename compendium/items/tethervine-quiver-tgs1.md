# Tethervine Quiver
*Wondrous item, adventuring gear, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Tethervine-Quiver.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This seemingly overgrown quiver keeps a large plant magically concealed inside it. The quiver can store up to 20 arrows or bolts. When you draw a piece of ammunition from the quiver, you can speak the quiver's command word as a bonus action to magically connect the end of the ammunition to the plant inside the quiver. The plant is a rope-like vine that flies effortlessly behind a fired piece of ammunition. While wearing the quiver, you can use a bonus action to magically retract the vine up to 60 feet back into the quiver. Any object weighing less than 25 pounds hit by a connected piece of ammunition is pulled back toward the quiver when its retracted in this way. Despite the quiver's limitations, the rope-like vine can hold up to 250 pounds on its own.

If you hit a creature with an arrow or bolt that was connected to the vine, the vine magically disconnects itself and falls from the ammunition. You can disconnect the vine from the ammunition by speaking its command word again or by severing the vine from the quiver as a bonus action. Once severed, the vine is considered to be a mundane length of [hemp rope](compendium/items/hempen-rope-50-feet.md).

You can only fire a connected piece of ammunition as far as you have the vine to. The plant grows up to 120 feet long and regrows up to 30 feet of vine daily at dawn.
