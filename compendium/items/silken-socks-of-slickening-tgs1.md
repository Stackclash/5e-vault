# Silken Socks of Slickening
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Silken-Socks-of-Slickening.webp#right)  


This pair of magic, smooth socks are iridescent and oily to the touch. While wearing both socks on your feet, you can use them to cast the [grease](compendium/spells/grease.md) spell as an action (save DC 13). When you do, the spell targets a 10-foot square area adjacent to you. The magical oil runs off the socks to the ground at your feet, causing the ground to become slick. Once used, this property of the socks can't be used again until the next dawn.
