# Tlincalli Thorn
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A particularly fierce looking cactus that grows in a hook shape resembling that of a [tlincalli's](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tlincalli-mpmm.md) scorpion-like stinger. In fact, it is this property that makes this herb curious to magi-botanists, as the [tlincalli](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tlincalli-mpmm.md) themselves are instinctively drawn to these plants and will prioritise laying their eggs among themw henever possible. Unfortunately, no scholar has managed to interview a [tlincalli](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tlincalli-mpmm.md) and discover what connection (if any) they have to this plant, but the current theory is that the two specimens shaped each other's developmentâ€”with the [tlincalli](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tlincalli-mpmm.md) protecting the plant from harm, while in exchange, the strange venoms inherent in the needles of the plant are what give the young [tlincalli](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tlincalli-mpmm.md) the hard exoskeletons that protect them in their most vulnerable years.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after preparing this herb, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC as your skin becomes exceptionally hard and scale-like.
