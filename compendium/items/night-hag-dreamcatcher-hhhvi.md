*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

A creature that sleeps with their head under this item only has good dreams and are immune to any magical effect that would affect its sleep in a negative way. If two creatures sleep under this item, there is a 50% chance that they will enter a shared dream in which they may interact with each other freely.
