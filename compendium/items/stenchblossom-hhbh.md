# Stenchblossom
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

They say a rose by any other name would smell as sweetâ€”in the same vein, the stenchblossom would smell just as horrid. Described as a mix between fresh dung and rotting meat, this horrid variety of daisy relies on its stench to attract flies and other insects as a means of spreading its pollen. It is unknown what brave or foolhardy soul first discovered this, but consuming this herb, will cause you to emit the same kind of odour as the herb, thankfully only for a short time.

## Effect:

As an action, you may consume this herb, causing you to emit a debilitating odour for the next 10 minutes. During this time, any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you and that can smell, must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, that creature makes all attacks at disadvantage, and attacks against them have advantage as they wretch. This effect ends if the creature moves more than 5 feet away from you, or loses their sense of smell.
