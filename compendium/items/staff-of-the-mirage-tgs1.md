This magical staff has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff vanishes and is lost.

You gain a +2 bonus to your spell save DC when casting one of these spells from the staff: [disguise self](compendium/spells/disguise-self.md) (1 charge), [hallucinatory terrain](compendium/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) (4 charges), [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) (2 charges), [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md) (2 charges), [mislead](compendium/spells/mislead.md) (5 charges), or [silent image](compendium/spells/silent-image.md) (1 charge).
