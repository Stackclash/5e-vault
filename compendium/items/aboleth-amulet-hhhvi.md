# Aboleth Amulet
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This pale turquoise amulet seems to have a faint flicker of something moving in it, like seeing a creature in murky waters. While wearing this amulet, you gain [telepathy](compendium/spells/telepathy.md) out to a range of 120 ft., can understand and speak Deep Speech, and become proficient in Intelligence ([History](/compendium/rules/skills.md#History)) checks if you weren't proficient already.

You may also spend an action to target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you. This charm persists until either you or the target dies, or if you are on different planes of existence. You and the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target may communicate with each other telepathically over any distance so long as you are wearing and attuned to this item.

You may only have up to 3 targets [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way at a time. If you successfully charm another target while you already have 3 targets [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), the charm effect ends on the creature that you [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) first. Whenever the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from you. If a creature succeeds on either resisting the charm effect or if the charm effect on them ends, they become immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.
