This shimmering silver katana is always cold to the touch, and a flurry of snow and ice trails behind it whenever it's swung. This sword has the finesse property, and when you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) cold damage.

You can use an action to speak the weapon's command word and swing it down in front of you. When you do, a blast of freezing winds erupts in a 30-foot cone from the blade. Each creature within that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as it's struck by the flurry of icy shrapnel. A creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) slashing damage, `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage, and `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
