# Potion of Adaptation
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, your form becomes particularly malleable and you quickly adapt to hazardous environments. For the next 6 hours, you gain the following benefits:

- You have [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet if you had less than that before.  
- You automatically succeed on saving throws against becoming [exhausted](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) imposed by being subjected to the effects of extreme weather.  
- You can breathe underwater and have a swim speed equal to you walking speed.  
- Any transmutation magic cast on you has double its normal duration.  

Due to the dubious origins of this potion's ingredients, when this potion's effects end, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for the next hour. This potion's contents constantly change in hue and colour, ranging from a vibrant red, to a dull blue.
