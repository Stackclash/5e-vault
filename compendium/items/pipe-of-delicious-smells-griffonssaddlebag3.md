# Pipe of Delicious Smells
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Pipe-of-Delicious-Smells.webp#right)  


Smoke from this pipe is normally odorless. While smoking it, you can use an action to exhale a puff of smoke that magically smells like delicious food. You choose what food it smells like, such as a freshly baked pie, stew, or tea. The smell dissipates after a few seconds.
