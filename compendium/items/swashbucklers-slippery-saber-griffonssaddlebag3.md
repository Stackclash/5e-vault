# Swashbuckler's Slippery Saber
*Major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Swashbucklers-Slippery-Saber.webp#right)  


The handle of this well-worn blade looks like a peeled banana made of brass. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon and roll a 6 on its damage die, the target of the attack must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
