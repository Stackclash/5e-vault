# Helm of Abyssal Domination
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This helmet has 11 charges. While wearing this helm, you spend an action to expend 1 or more charges to do one of the following:

- You may cast the spell [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) (1 charge), [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) (3 charges plus 1 additional charge for every level above 3rd), [hold monster](compendium/spells/hold-monster.md) (5 charges plus 1 additional charge for every level above 5th), or [wall of fire](compendium/spells/wall-of-fire.md) (4 charges plus 1 additional charge for every level above 4th).  
- For the next minute, any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of you must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, unless you are [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). On a failed save, the creature is [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours (2 charges).  
- For the next 10 minutes you gain [truesight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Truesight) out to a range of 120 feet (1 charge).  
- For the next hour you gain telepathy out to 120 feet and are able to both understand and speak Infernal (1 charge).  
- For the next hour you gain resistance to cold, fire, and poison damage (2 charges).  
- You may target a devil with a CR less than 20 that you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for 1 hour. While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you, that devil must obey any command you give it that is not directly harmful to it. If a devil succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours (3 charges).  

This helmet regains `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) charges at dawn.
