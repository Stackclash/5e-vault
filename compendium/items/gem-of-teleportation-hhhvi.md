# Gem of Teleportation
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This gem has 5 charges. While holding this gem, you may spend your action and 1 charge in order to teleport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. This gem regains `dice: 1d4 + 1|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) charges at dawn.

Alternatively, you may use 5 charges to cast the spell [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) through the gem with the plane of Gehenna as your destination. If used in this way, the gem dissolves into a useless black ichor and is destroyed.
