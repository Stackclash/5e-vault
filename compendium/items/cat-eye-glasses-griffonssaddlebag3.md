# Cat Eye Glasses
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Cat-Eye-Glasses.webp#right)  


These glasses are incredibly dark. When light hits them at the right angle, they seem to glow with an otherworldly light. While wearing the glasses, anything brightly lit appears dimly lit to you instead. Despite their shadowy lenses, the glasses offer additional clarity when seeing things in darkness: you don't suffer any penalties when perceiving or targeting a creature within 30 feet of you as a result of it being in nonmagical darkness.

If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait while wearing the glasses.
