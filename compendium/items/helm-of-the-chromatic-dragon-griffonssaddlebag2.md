# Helm of the Chromatic Dragon
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement by a dragonborn of evil alignment)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Helm-of-the-Chromatic-Dragon.webp#right)  


This iridescent helmet has been blessed by a powerful, evil dragon. While wearing this helmet, your breath weapon deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage of its type, and you can choose whether it deals acid, cold, fire, lightning or poison damage. You can also choose if your breath weapon affects a 15-foot cone or 5-by-30-foot line, and if creatures affected by it must make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw.

In addition, when you use your breath weapon, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 5 or 6, you gain an additional use of your breath weapon before you need to finish a short or long rest.
