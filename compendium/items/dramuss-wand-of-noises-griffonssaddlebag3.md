# Dramus's Wand of Noises
*Wand, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Dramus-Wand-of-Noises.webp#right)  


This wand has a flared tip that leads down into the center of it. The wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to use one of the following properties:

## Absorb Sound

You point the wand at a non-living object that you can see within 30 feet of you, which can be no larger than 3 feet in any dimension. Until the end of your next turn, that object makes no noise (such as a squeaky door hinge or tumbling boulder), and any noise that it would have made for the duration is stored in the wand. A sound stored in this way can be released by the wand by using an action, without expending an additional charge from it. When you release a sound, you must also point the wand at a point that you can see within 30 feet of you. The stored sound then emanates once from that point for up to 6 seconds, after which the sound is lost from the wand. Unused stored sounds are lost daily at dawn.

## Thunderwave

You cast the [thunderwave](compendium/spells/thunderwave.md) spell from the wand (save DC 13).
