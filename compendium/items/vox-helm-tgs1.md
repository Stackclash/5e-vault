# Vox Helm
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Vox-Helm.webp#right)  


This metal helm has a second guard that rests in front of your mouth and alters your voice. You can raise and lower this guard using an action. While wearing the helmet with the guard lowered, your voice sounds obviously enchanted and can be adjusted to modify its pitch, masculinity or femininity, and reverberation at will (no action required).
