# Gibbering Bell
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Gibbering-Bell.webp#right)  


A piece of gibbering mouther has been latched onto this rusted handbell. When swung through the air, the bell produces a grotesque, fleshy sound instead of a bell's typical metallic clamor. The mouth of the bell also serves as the mouth of the attached monster, biting down on anything that comes too close. As a result, you can use this bell as a makeshift club that deals `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage, instead of its normal damage die, as the mouther bites down on the target as opposed to bludgeoning it.

While holding the bell, you can use an action to speak its command word and vigorously ring it, agitating the gibbering mouther and causing it to emit its infamous babbling sound. Any creature within 20 feet of the bell that can hear it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack. Once this property of the bell has been used, it can't be used again until `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) hours have passed.

If you fail the saving throw against the bell's gibbering effect, you treat a roll of 5 or 6 on the `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) as if it were a 1 to 4, and if you roll a 7 or 8, you ignore the effect and can immediately make a single weapon attack with the bell against a creature of your choice within your reach.
