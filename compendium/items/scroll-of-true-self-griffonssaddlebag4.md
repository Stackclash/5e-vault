# Scroll of True Self
*Scroll, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Scroll-of-True-Self.webp#right)  


This long scroll is covered in writing. It takes 1 minute to read it aloud in its entirety. At the end of the minute, you're affected by the [true polymorph](compendium/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell. This version of the spell can only transform you into a humanoid, and if you concentrate on the spell for the full duration, it can't be dispelled against your will. Your game statistics and worn equipment remain the same, although your racial traits are replaced by the ones of your new form.

This scroll is only destroyed if the spell is concentrated on for the full duration and becomes permanent. The spell ends early if another creature reads from the scroll before then and gains its effects.
