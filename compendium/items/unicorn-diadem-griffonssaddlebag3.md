# Unicorn Diadem
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Unicorn-Diadem.webp#right)  


A unicorn's horn rests at the center of this diadem. While wearing the diadem, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, as if you were holding it. In addition, you have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against poison. When you cast a spell while wearing the diadem, you can change the spell's damage type for that casting to radiant damage, unless its normal damage type is necrotic.

While wearing the diadem, you can use an action to touch another creature and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. That creature then gains a +2 bonus to its AC until the start of your next turn and regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot you expended. If these hit points would cause that creature to exceed its hit point maximum, it gains half of those excess hit points as temporary hit points.
