This magic crossbow has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 of the crossbow's charges to speak its command word and fire a bolt at a point on the ground you can see within the weapon's normal range. The bolt creates a magical vacuum in a 20-foot-radius circle centered on that point, causing strange, spectral tides to pull creatures toward it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. A creature is pulled up to 15 feet toward the point on a failed save, or only 5 feet on a successful one. Until the start of your next turn, the area becomes difficult terrain.

At the start of your next turn, the point erupts, sending out a powerful wave of water in a 20-foot radius that extinguishes all nonmagical flames within the area. The water then vanishes. Any creature in the area when the point erupts must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
