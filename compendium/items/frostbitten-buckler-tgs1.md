# Frostbitten Buckler
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Frostbitten-Buckler.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This icy shield has 3 charges and regains all of them each day at dawn. When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can expend 1 of the shield's charges as a reaction to deal `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) cold damage to the attacking creature. After the attack, you gain that same amount of cold damage as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 minute.
