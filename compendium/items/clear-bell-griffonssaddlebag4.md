# Clear Bell
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Clear-Bell.webp#right)  


When you use an action to ring this all-glass handbell, the sound rings out with perfect clarity. Any creature within 30 feet of the bell that can hear it can immediately make a saving throw to end any one effect on it that's causing it to be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). The saving throw DC is the same as the original effect's.

Once the bell has been rung in this way, it shouldn't be rung again until the next dawn. Each time it's used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and shattering into a fine, nonmagical powder.
