# Potion of Sickness
*Potion, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you become sick with mane disease for `dice: 1d12|avg` (`1d12`) hours. While sick in this way, your nose becomes runny and your eyes watery, causing you to have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. However, your relatively mild sickness also boosts your immune system, giving you advantage on Constitution saving throws against being [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) and other diseases. This potion is a pale grey colour with a string of liquid in it that resembles watery mucus.
