# Potion of Sickness
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, you become sick with mane disease for `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) hours. While sick in this way, your nose becomes runny and your eyes watery, causing you to have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. However, your relatively mild sickness also boosts your immune system, giving you advantage on Constitution saving throws against being [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) and other diseases. This potion is a pale grey colour with a string of liquid in it that resembles watery mucus.
