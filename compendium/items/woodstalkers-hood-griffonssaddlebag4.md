# Woodstalker's Hood
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Woodstalkers-Hood.webp#right)  


This leafy green hood is adorned with a pair of branch-like antlers that grow from either side of it. You gain a +2 bonus to any Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) or Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks you make while wearing the hood. If you're wearing the hood in a wooded area, your face becomes heavily obscured in shadow.

The hood has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action while wearing the hood to expend 1 of its charges to use one of the following properties from it.

## The Eyes That Speak

You gain the ability to comprehend and telepathically communicate with beasts for 1 hour, provided that you and the beast can see each other. When you do, your eyes glow a soft green. For the duration, beasts with a challenge rating of 1 or lower are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

## The Twig That Snaps

You can shift your awareness to a plant that you can see within 300 feet of you. You can use your senses to see and hear as if you were in the plant's location. For the duration, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. Your senses remain in the plant's space for 10 minutes, until you're more than 300 feet away from the plant, or until you end the effect early (no action required).

## The Wind That Howls

You can force up to 4 creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
