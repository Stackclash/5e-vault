# Siphon Boon
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you [cast a spell](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Cast%20a%20Spell), you may instead cast it as if you used a spell slot one level higher than the one you actually used, even if such a level would not normally be available to you. Once you have used this ability once, you may not use it again until you have finished a short or long rest. If you are attuned to this item, you may also use it as a spellcasting focus.
