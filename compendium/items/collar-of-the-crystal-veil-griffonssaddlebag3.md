# Collar of the Crystal Veil
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Collar-of-the-Crystal-Veil.webp#right)  


This platinum collar surrounds a chained web of ornate diamonds with a series of armor-like plates. While wearing the necklace, a translucent, glittering veil surrounds you: your AC is equal to 12 + your spellcasting ability modifier if you are wearing no armor and using no shield. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

## Crystalline Barrier

As a bonus action while wearing the necklace, you can project its magic outward to form a magical barrier. The barrier uses your AC, has 50 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. It extends from you to form a 10-foot-radius sphere. Nothing can physically pass through the barrier, and spells cast from outside the barrier can't target anything within its area. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

The barrier remains for as long as you concentrate (as if [concentrating](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute, or until it drops to 0 hit points. You can designate up to 4 creatures that can pass through the barrier when it appears. The sphere moves with you and remains centered on you. It ends early if you remove the necklace or if you move in such a way that a creature you didn't designate would be forced to enter its area. Once this property of the necklace has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
