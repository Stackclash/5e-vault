# Magentan Sun-Saw (Very Rare)
*Weapon ([scimitar](compendium/items/scimitar.md)), major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Magentan-Sun-Saw.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The typical [magentan sun-saw](compendium/items/magentan-sun-saw-griffonssaddlebag2.md), an uncommon item, is a falchion with a curved metal guard that protects your hand. The sword has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn.

The following magentan sun-saw is a very rare variant with more powerful properties. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you expend 1 of the weapon's charges when you hit with an attack, the light is sunlight (albeit still magenta in color) and deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage to the target, instead of `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`). If the target has the Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity trait, such as a drow or vampire, it's considered to be in sunlight until the end of its next turn.
