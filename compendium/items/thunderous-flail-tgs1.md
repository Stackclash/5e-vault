# Thunderous Flail
*Weapon ([flail](compendium/items/flail.md)), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Thunderous-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This flail has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges each day at dawn. You can expend 1 charge to cast the [thunderwave](compendium/spells/thunderwave.md) spell (save DC 15). The ball of the flail is the origin of the spell. As long as the flail has at least 1 charge, you deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage to the first target you hit with it on each of your turns.

If you make a melee attack using the flail, you can immediately expend 1 charge to cast *thunderwave* as a bonus action in the direction of your last attacked target.

The ball of the flail is attached to the chain with a powerful magnetic connection that can be released at will. You can make a ranged attack using the flail by releasing the ball mid-swing. This attack has a normal range of 20 feet and long range of 60. Strength is your ability modifier for this attack. While the ball is within 60 feet of you, you can magnetically pull it back up to 20 feet towards you as a bonus action. It magically reattaches itself to the chain when it enters the same space as you.

While the ball is detached, you can still use the flail to cast *thunderwave*. When you do, the spell's area of effect becomes a 10-foot radius sphere centered on the ball.
