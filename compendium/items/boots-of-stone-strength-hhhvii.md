# Boots of Stone Strength
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

These hard-toed boots grant their wearer the sturdiness of the earth itself. While wearing these boots and standing on either stone or soil, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain [tremorsense](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Tremorsense) out to a range of 30 feet.  
- If you are subjected to an effect other than gravity that would attempt to move you against your will, you may spend your reaction to instead not move.  
- You ignore any penalties to your movement speed that would be imposed by walking over non-magical stone or soil.
