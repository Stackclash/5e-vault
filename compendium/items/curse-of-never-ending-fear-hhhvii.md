# Curse of Never-Ending Fear
*Curse, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:

## Curse:

> [!quote]-  
> 
> While attuned to this item you become cursed. While cursed, any saving throw you make to resist becoming [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) is done so at disadvantage. Furthermore, if you become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of a creature, that [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition continues indefinitely and only ends if that creature dies, that creature willingly ends the effect on you as a free action, or if the creature remains out of your line of sight for 24 hours.
> 
> This curse ends permanently on both the item and you if the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic is cast on either you or the cursed item.
