*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a human)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mantle-of-Adaptivity.webp#right)  


This cloak brings out the tenacity and adaptivity of any human who wears it. Choose one of the following options daily at dawn. You gain the benefits of that property while wearing the mantle.

## Desert Folk

You gain resistance to fire damage and ignore difficult terrain created by sand or fire (such as lava or a similar hot surface). The cloak's pattern becomes a series of thin white lines dotted across an otherwise plain tan backdrop.

## Forest Folk

You can hide when only lightly obscured by branches, grasses, or similar forest foliage. You also have advantage on Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks to track creatures in these areas. The cloak's pattern becomes filled with amorphous brown and green shapes.

## Mountain Folk

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock you [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). The cloak's pattern becomes a series of gray and brown triangles.

## Prairie Folk

Your walking speed increases by 5 feet. In addition, you have advantage on any Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check made to interact with mounts, and when you mount or dismount such a creature, it only costs you 5 feet of movement, instead of half your speed. The cloak's pattern becomes checkered and orange.

## Sea Folk

You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and can hold your breath for twice as long. The cloak's pattern becomes a shifting gradient of light to dark blue.

## Tundra Folk

You gain resistance to cold damage and ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. The cloak's pattern becomes an icy blue with scattered silver dots.

When found, the mantle's property and appearance are from a random property.
