# Bag of Goodberry Gummy Fish
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Bag-of-Goodberry-Gummy-Fish.webp#right)  


Goodberry gummy fish are gooey sweets that look like Tiny, gelatinous fish. When found, they typically come in bags of `dice:1d6+10|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 10`) gummies, which are almost always red.

A goodberry gummy fish functions like a single berry from the [goodberry](compendium/spells/goodberry.md) spell, except that eating a gummy also grants you a swimming speed of 30 feet for 1 hour.

Alternatively, you can use an action to submerge a gummy in water to magically animate it, using the quipper's statistics. If you submerge 5 or more gummies in water at the same time, they function as a group, using the swarm of quippers' statistics instead. The quippers are friendly to you, but aren't magically compelled to obey any of your commands. After 1 hour, the animated gummies dissolve and are destroyed.
