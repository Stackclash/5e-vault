# Crystal Ball of Storms
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Crystal-Ball-of-Storms.webp#right)  


This [crystal ball](compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) is about 6 inches in diameter. Inside is a perpetual storm that crackles with ferocity. While touching it, you can either cast the [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) or [call lightning](compendium/spells/call-lightning.md) spell with it, using a spell save DC of 17.

If the [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell lasts for the full duration, you can choose to cause a storm to form above the sensor's location at the time the spell ends, as if by the [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) spell. The storm appears outside and in the sky above that point. The spell creates rain, hail, or snow (your choice) in stormy wind conditions; the temperature in the area drops by 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The storm then remains for the next 8 hours, and this property of the [crystal ball](compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) can't be used again until the next dawn.

Alternatively, you can cast [call lightning](compendium/spells/call-lightning.md) from the [crystal ball](compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) while looking through its sensor. The sensor must be outdoors, and it must be in stormy conditions. You don't need to concentrate on this call lightning to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends. When this [call lightning](compendium/spells/call-lightning.md) spell ends, it can't be used in this way again until the next dawn.

If the [crystal ball](compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) is destroyed, the storm appears outside and centered in the sky above that point. The storm recreates the effects of the [control weather](compendium/spells/control-weather.md) spell, as determined by the GM. The storm is permanent; only a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell can dispel it.
