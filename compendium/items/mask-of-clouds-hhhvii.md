# Mask of Clouds
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard or [Trickster Domain](compendium/classes/cleric-trickery-domain.md) cleric)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This two-faced mask has been imbued with divine energy siphoned from a cloud giant smiling one mask.

While wearing and attuned to this mask, your illusion spells gain a particular potency. Whenever you cast an illusion spell that creates an image, that image becomes physical and emulates the feel, texture, and weight of the real object it is imitating; this allows your images to withstand physical inspection. However, if more than 10 pounds of force are applied to your image, it will burst into a thick, cloud-like fog and then quickly dissipate, thus revealing it as an illusion.
