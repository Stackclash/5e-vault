# Rope of Fantasy
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This coil of rope is 30 feet long. Any creature [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by this rope for 1 minute must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed). While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, a creature becomes extremely calm and unaggressive as they receive visions of their deepest wishes. The creature remains [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) until the rope is removed or until they receive damage. Once a creature has become [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by this rope once, or if they passed the initial saving throw, they cannot be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) again by this rope for 24 hours.
