# Titan Ship
*Wondrous item, airship, vehicle (air), artifact*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This ship's hull is formed from the shell of a [tarrasque](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md) and shares much of its properties. The ship is 30 feet wide, 70 feet long, and 20 feet high. It possesses 3 sails and can travel at 2 1/2 mph in a good wind. The ship has 25 AC, 500 HP, can house 60 passengers, carry 200 tons of cargo and has a damage threshold of 20.

In addition, this ship is immune to fire damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. If the [titan ship](compendium/vehicles/titan-ship-hhhvi.md) is targeted by a [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 1 to 5, the ship is unaffected. On a 6, the ship is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the ship, turning the caster into the target.

> [!note]
> Also available as a [vehicle.](compendium/vehicles/titan-ship-hhhvi.md)
