# Shadow Spikes
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

As an action, you can spread this bag of [caltrops](compendium/items/caltrops-bag-of-20.md) to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

When placed in dim light or darkness, these caltrops become [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), even to creatures with [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision). This invisibility lasts until they are exposed to bright light, upon which they return to their normal matte black appearance.
