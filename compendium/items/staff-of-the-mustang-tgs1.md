# Staff of the Mustang
*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-the-Mustang.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This dark wooden staff is carved in the shape of a majestic stallion. The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [phantom steed](compendium/spells/phantom-steed.md) spell from it. Alternatively, while holding the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges and speak the staff's command word as a bonus action to take the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action.

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff breaks in two as if bitten and is destroyed. When this happens, the sound of hooves can be heard galloping away in an indiscernible direction.
