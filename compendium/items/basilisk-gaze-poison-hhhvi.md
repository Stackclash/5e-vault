# Basilisk Gaze Poison
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested), uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Poison](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)

A creature that drinks this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 24 hours. While [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, a creature magically turns to stone and is [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified). A creature remains [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) like this until either the 24 hours have passed, or until freed by the [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.
