- **Properties**: Crafted by

A creature that drinks this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 24 hours. While [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a creature magically turns to stone and is [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#petrified). A creature remains [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#petrified) like this until either the 24 hours have passed, or until freed by the [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.
