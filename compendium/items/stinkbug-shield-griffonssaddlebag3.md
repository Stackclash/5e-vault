# Stinkbug Shield
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Stinkbug-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This shield is designed in the likeness of a brass stinkbug with green accents. While holding it, you can use your reaction when you're hit by a melee weapon attack to release a gaseous plume of stinking fog from the shield. The attacker must immediately succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or spend the rest of its action and bonus action retching and reeling. A creature that doesn't need to breathe is immune to this effect, but a creature with a trait that grants it advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell has disadvantage on the saving throw. This property of the shield can't be used again until the next dawn.
