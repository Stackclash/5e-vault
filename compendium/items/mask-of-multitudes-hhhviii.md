# Mask of Multitudes
*Wondrous item, cursed item, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted Artifact](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20Artifact), [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

This mask is a treated leather on top of a dark wooden backing. Despite these relatively mundane materials, the mask is incredibly life-like, and it is common for casual observers to believe that it watches them as they travel around the room. It is said that within this mask is every disguise that the demon prince [Fraz-Urb'luu](compendium/bestiary/npc/fraz-urbluu-mpmm.md) ever took, of which there are many. As its hollow eyes gaze upon new visages, it memorizes them and adds them to its evergrowing bank of identities.

Some legends state that this mask is in fact how the mortal that would become [Fraz-Urb'luu](compendium/bestiary/npc/fraz-urbluu-mpmm.md) became a demon prince. The belief is that long ago, this mortal found a mask that had seen the very act of creation and then donned it on themselves, granting them the ability to become anything that had ever lived. This is of course, unverifiable.

In order to attune to this mask, you must place it on your own face and leave it there for the duration of the normal attunement process. At the end of this time, the mask fuses with your face, granting you an eerie visage that resembles your own face, but with minor changes that seem offputting and unnatural to most people. These changes include a paler/waxier skin, eyes that do not catch the light properly, and stiff facial features that do not emote properly. If you are killed or end your attunement to this mask, it unfuses from your face and drops to the ground in front of you.

While wearing and attuned to this mask, you can't be targeted by divination magic against your will or perceived through magical scrying sensors. In addition, your Charisma score and your Charisma score maximum increase by 2.

## Spellcasting

You may use the mask to cast the [alter self](compendium/spells/alter-self.md), [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md), and [phantasmal force](compendium/spells/phantasmal-force.md) spells at will. In addition, you may cast the [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md), [dream](compendium/spells/dream.md), [mislead](compendium/spells/mislead.md), [programmed illusion](compendium/spells/programmed-illusion.md), and [seeming](compendium/spells/seeming.md) spells 3 times each and the [mirage arcane](compendium/spells/mirage-arcane.md), [modify memory](compendium/spells/modify-memory.md), and [project image](compendium/spells/project-image.md) spells once each. All expended uses are restored upon the next dawn. The DC for all spells cast in this way is 18.

## Lord of Deception

As an action you may shapeshift into any humanoid that you have seen before. Your stats remain the same in your new form, except for your size which changes to match your new form. Your equipment does not change with you.

While shapeshifted in this way, your mannerisms and voice match the chosen humanoid perfectly and you give no reason for casual observers to question your disguise.

## Master of Puppets

As an action, you may choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you and instantly create a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the [simulacrum](compendium/spells/simulacrum.md) spell). This simulacrum obeys your commands, acts immediately after you on the initiative order and is destroyed at the start of your next turn.

## Curse

When you become attuned to the amulet, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu table](compendium/bestiary/npc/fraz-urbluu-mpmm.md)* ^[See the info tab] and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Mask

This item can only be destroyed if it is kept below Castle Greyhawk undisturbed and unused for 100 years, after which the mask will dissolve into dust and become useless.
