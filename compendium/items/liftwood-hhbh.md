# Liftwood
*Herb, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHbH/Liftwood.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

There is a legend of a magical tree that once rose out of the world's oceans, floating above its roiling surface as its long roots snaked onto tiny islands to seek solid ground. What exactly befell this tree differs in each telling, but the only agreed upon fact is that it was destroyed and shattered into countless pieces that now float throughout the ocean, occasionally washing up on shores. These fragments carry the same magic of the great tree they were once a part of however, and maintain a much weaker power of levitation to any creature that taps into it.

## Effect:

This herb is a piece of magical wood, measuring roughly 6 feet in length and the thickness of an average human's forearm. While holding onto this herb, you may focus on it as an action, giving you a flying speed of 5 feet until the end of your turn. Once used, this herb cannot be used again until the next dawn.
