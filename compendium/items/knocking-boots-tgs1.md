# Knocking Boots
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Knocking-Boots.webp#right)  


These steel-toed boots of dwarven make are adorned with an embossed key on the toe. As an action, you can kick an object that contains a mundane or magical means of preventing access to cast the [knock](compendium/spells/knock.md) spell on it using the boots. Once this property of the boots has been used, they can't be used again in this way until the following dawn.
