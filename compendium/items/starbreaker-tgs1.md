- **Damage**: 1d8 P

This glowing morningstar casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet while you hold it. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Targets hit by the weapon take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) radiant damage. In addition, you can use an action to cast the [daylight](compendium/spells/daylight.md) spell using the weapon. Once the weapon has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the following dawn.
