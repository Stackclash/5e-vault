# Vineyard Amulet
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Vineyard-Amulet.webp#right)  


This necklace is a sprig of an enchanted grapevine that magically grows in a loop. A small grape cluster hangs from it like a pendant, which carries `dice:1d12+10|noform|avg` (`1d12 + 10`) grapes on it when found. You can pull one of the berries from the necklace using an action, which magically transforms the grape into a bottle of fine wine worth no more than 10 gp. You choose the color and kind of wine each time.

When the last grape is removed, the bundle's stem falls off and is destroyed. The amulet loses its magic, but can still be planted to sprout a new, nonmagical grape vine.
