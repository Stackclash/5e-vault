# Pipe of the Mermaid
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Pipe-of-the-Mermaid.webp#right)  


This pipe is carved in the shape of a wooden mermaid holding a silver pitcher. You can smoke the pipe as normal using pipe tobacco. When you do, smoke pours from the pitcher before eventually rising. When the pitcher is filled with water, such as when it's submerged, it produces bubbles with each puff; you can breathe underwater through the pipe for as long as you smoke it in this way.
