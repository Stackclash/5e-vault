# Staff of Favorable Winds
*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-Favorable-Winds.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

While you hold this staff, areas affected by strong winds do not count as difficult terrain for you.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it using the required casting time as well as your spell save DC: [cone of cold](compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md) (5 charges), [feather fall](compendium/spells/feather-fall.md) (1 charge), [gust of wind](compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md) (2 charges), or [wind wall](compendium/spells/wind-wall.md) (3 charges).

In addition, while holding the staff, you can create a harmless sensory effect using the air. You can cause leaves to rustle, slam shutters closed in a sudden gust, or cause your clothing to billow dramatically.

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff turns to dust and is blown away by a sudden flurry of wind.
