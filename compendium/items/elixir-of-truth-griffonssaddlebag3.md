# Elixir of Truth
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


FOR [HEDGE MAGE](compendium/classes/wizard-hedge-mage-griffonssaddlebag3.md#Hedge%20Mage%20(Level%202)) USE ONLY

Ingredients: A sprig of cherry, a mockingbird feather, and fleck of fools gold.

Command: Two truths and a lie, each one said when adding an ingredient

When a creature drinks this elixir, it must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. A creature can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failed save, the creatures eyes become pale and it can not speak a deliberate lie for the next 10 minutes. An affected creature is aware of the elixirs effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
