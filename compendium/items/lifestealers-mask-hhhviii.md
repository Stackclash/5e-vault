# Lifestealer's Mask
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this mask, if a creature you can see within 60 feet of you attempts to regain hit points, you may spend your reaction to force it to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, that creature gains no hit points, and any that it would have gained is instead restored to you as temporary hit points.
