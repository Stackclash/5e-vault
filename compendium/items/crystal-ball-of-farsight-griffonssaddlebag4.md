# Crystal Ball of Farsight
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Crystal-Ball-of-Farsight.webp#right)  


This [crystal ball](compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [arcane eye](compendium/spells/arcane-eye.md) spell with it. The spell ends early if a creature touches the magical eye; the creature then knows that it had been observed by divination magic. For the duration of the spell, you are [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), and the crystal mimics the appearance of one of your eyes.
