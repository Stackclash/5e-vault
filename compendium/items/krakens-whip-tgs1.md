# Kraken's Whip
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Krakens-Whip.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This whip is made using the shrunken tentacle of a great sea creature. It still writhes slightly on its own.

As an action, you can force a creature you can see within 10 feet of you to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (their choice). On a failure, the creature is grappled by the whip's tentacle and takes `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage. The affected target or another creature can use an action to reattempt the saving throw, escaping the grapple upon a success. While grappled, the creature takes `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage at the end of each of its subsequent turns.

You can't use the whip to attack while grappling a creature with it in this way. While holding the whip, you can end the grapple at any time (no action required), and your movement speed is halved when you move more than 10 feet away from the grappled creature as you drag it along behind you.
