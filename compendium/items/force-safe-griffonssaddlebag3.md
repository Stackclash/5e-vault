# Force Safe
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Force-Safe.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

When not in use, this device appears like a square metallic tile. It's 6 inches on either side, 2 inches deep, and weighs 2 pounds. An indentation at the center of the tile opens into a small hole. When you use an action to place a finger in the indentation, the tile magically pricks it to extract a drop of blood.

If the tile isn't activated when it draws blood, it magically activates and creates a small, 1-foot cube of magical force below it, which can be used to contain objects for safe keeping. You can tap the tile to an object small enough to fit inside the cube that isn't being worn or carried as part of this action to specify that the cube encompass only that object. The cube is immobile and impenetrable, as if by the resilient sphere spell. Its walls emit a dim green light and hum with electrical power. A creature that touches the walls of the cube takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage.

The tile remains active until the same creature's blood is dropped into the hole, at which point the walls of force vanish. A [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) spell destroys the walls and deactivates the tile immediately.
