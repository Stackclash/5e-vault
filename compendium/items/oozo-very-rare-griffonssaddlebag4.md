# Oozo (Very Rare)
*Potion, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Oozo.webp#right)  


The typical oozo, an uncommon potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes you to become slightly gelatinous and translucent. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, creatures that make a Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to search for you while you're hiding must roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from the check. If you haven't moved since the start of your last turn, they must roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) instead. The drink is gelatinous and is more accurately slurped than drunk. Despite its questionable texture, it tastes light and refreshing, with a hint of licorice and orange. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.

The following oozo is a very rare variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.

For 1 hour after drinking this potion, whenever you remain perfectly still for 1 minute, you and anything you wear or carry becomes [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until you move. In addition, if a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, it immediately takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) acid damage.
