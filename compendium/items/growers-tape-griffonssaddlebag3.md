# Grower's Tape
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Growers-Tape.webp#right)  


This roll of tape is 1 inch wide and 60 feet long. You can use an action to cut off a length of tape and apply it to a surface. The tape immediately decomposes and turns into fertile soil once it's stuck to a surface. Plants rapidly grow from the soil, becoming fully ripe after 1 hour.

Roll on the table below once for every 1 foot of tape used to determine what grows from that stretch of soil.

| dice: d6 | Grown Plant |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | A sickly mushroom. Boiling three of these for 1 hour renders one vial's worth of basic poison. |
| 2-5 | A cluster of random crops, which yield either 1 pound of wheat (30%), 1 pound of ginger (30%), 1 pound of cloves (30%), or 1 pound of saffron (10%). |
| 6 | A vine grows from the ground to produce 1d4 berries, which function as if created by the [goodberry](compendium/spells/goodberry.md) spell. |
^grown-plant

If you use one or more strips of tape to enclose an area, the tape recreates either version of the [plant growth](compendium/spells/plant-growth.md) spell (your choice) for all plants within that area. For example, you can use 20 feet of tape to enclose a 5-foot square, or 30 feet of tape to enclose a 5-foot-radius circle.
