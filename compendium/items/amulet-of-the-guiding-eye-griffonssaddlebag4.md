# Amulet of the Guiding Eye
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Amulet-of-the-Guiding-Eye.webp#right)  


This amulet features two eye-like pendants: one humanoid and one bestial. If you're within 5 feet of a friendly beast, such as a beast companion or familiar (including one created by the [find familiar](compendium/spells/find-familiar.md) spell), you ignore the effects of being [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), provided the beast isn't also [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded).

You can use an action to charm a Small or smaller beast that you're touching or that you can see within 30 feet of you, provided that it isn't hostile towards you. The beast is [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for 24 hours, and it is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. This effect ends early if you use this feature again or if you or your companions do anything harmful to it. You can use an action to see through the beast's eyes while it's within 30 feet of you, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal sight. While seeing through the beast's eyes, you gain the benefits of any special senses that rely on sight possessed by that creature, though you are [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) to your own surroundings. Unless you have another way to command or control the beast, it shares your initiative in combat and uses its movement to remain within 5 feet of you. On its turn, it takes either the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) or [Dodge](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action.
