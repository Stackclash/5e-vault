# Shadow Dye
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

You may spend your action to pour this dye on yourself. If you do so, you take on a semi-corporeal shadowy form for the next hour. During this time, you gain a vulnerability to radiant damage and resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. In addition, so long as you are within dim light or darkness, you may take the [Hide](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action, and you make Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks at advantage.
