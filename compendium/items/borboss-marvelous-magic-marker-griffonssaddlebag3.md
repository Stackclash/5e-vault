# Borbos's Marvelous Magic Marker
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Borboss-Marvelous-Magic-Marker.webp#right)  


This quill-like tool has a narrow brush that extends from its end, which produces its own ink. You can use this marker in place of ink and a quill as [calligrapher's supplies](compendium/items/calligraphers-supplies.md). While holding it, you can use a bonus action to mentally change the color of the ink that flows from the brush. Decorating the marker's metal casing is a dazzling spectrum of colors, which move and shimmer while the marker is being used. The brush can be retracted into the metal casing to keep it from leaving errant marks by clicking a button at the top of the marker.

While holding the marker, you can use a bonus action to triple-click its button. For the next minute, the marker magically erases any ink it's brushed across without a trace, instead of leaving ink behind. This effect ends early if you use a bonus action to triple-click the button again. For the duration, you can erase up to 1 square foot of ink, containing no more than 150 characters or 25 words. Once this property of the pen has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
