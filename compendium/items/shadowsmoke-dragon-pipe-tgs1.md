# Shadowsmoke Dragon Pipe
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shadowsmoke-Dragon-Pipe.webp#right)  


This magic pipe leaves behind odorless smoke that dissipates quickly. Its head easily detaches, allowing you to refill it. The pipe has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to blow a small, condensed smoke ring at a friendly creature (including yourself) that you can see within 30 feet of you.

A creature can immediately turn invisible when it's affected by the smoke (no action required) or choose to wear the smoke as if it were a physical ring. This ring lasts for 1 minute or until the creature uses a bonus action on one of its turns to turn invisible. A creature turned invisible by the smoke ring reappears at the start of its next turn or when it attacks or cast a spell. A creature can only have 1 smoke ring at any time.
