# Wand of Stars
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Warding-Staff.webp#right)  


This antiquated, dark blue wand is adorned with a glowing star at its tip. When it's swung, small specks of starlight drift from its end.

The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand scatters into glittering dust and is destroyed.

## Spells

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15) from it: [color spray](compendium/spells/color-spray.md) (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), [daylight](compendium/spells/daylight.md) (3 charges), [hypnotic pattern](compendium/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md) (3 charges), [light](compendium/spells/light.md) (no charges), [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), or [prestidigitation](compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md) (no charges).

## Starlight Wayfinder

While you can see stars in the sky and are holding the wand, you can use an action to call out a cardinal direction and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, stars in that direction appear brighter to you for 1 hour or until you use the wand again to call out a new direction.
