# Bangle of Sun and Moon
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Bangle-of-Sun-and-Moon.webp#right)  


This bangle features a personified sun and moon, transitioning from gold to silver midway through the band. Three small diamonds mark their eyes. While wearing the bangle, you always know how long it is until sunrise, sunset, midday, and midnight.

The bangle has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 2 of the bangle's charges to cast the [daylight](compendium/spells/daylight.md) spell from it. Alternatively, you can expend 1 or more of the bangle's charges to cast the [moonbeam](compendium/spells/moonbeam.md) spell from it (save DC 13). For 1 charge, you cast the 2nd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. When you expend 2 or more charges to cast [moonbeam](compendium/spells/moonbeam.md) in this way, you can choose whether the spell's damage type is cold, fire, or radiant.

If you have 11 or more levels in the druid class and are wearing this bangle, you can expend 3 charges from the bangle to cast the [sunbeam](compendium/spells/sunbeam.md) spell from it (save DC 13). When you do, there is a permanent and cumulative 25 percent chance that the bangle is destroyed when the spell ends.
