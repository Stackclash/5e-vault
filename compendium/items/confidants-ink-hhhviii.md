# Confidant's Ink
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This 1-ounce bottle of ink carries an enchantment that causes an illusion to be placed on whatever message it is used to write. Once you have finished writing the message, you speak a command word of your choosing over it, sealing the magic inside. Any creature that attempts to read this message only sees it as indecipherable gibberish unless they speak the command word within 5 feet of it, at which point the true message reveals itself to them. A creature that is able to see through illusions is immune to the ability of this ink.
