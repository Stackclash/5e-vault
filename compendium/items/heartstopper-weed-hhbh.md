# Heartstopper Weed
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A cousin of chamomile that packs the same calming effect, but amplified to an absurd degree. Identified by its pale-grey colouration, tea made from the roots and stem of this plant cause a creature's central nervous system to stabilise at its most optimal conditionsâ€”and then prevent absolutely any deviation from these levels. The resulting fugue has been described as a dulling of one's feelings and an ultimate calm that is unaffected by any external stimuli. While this dampening effect may sound unpleasant to some, others appreciate the stability it provides.

## Effect:

After preparing this herb, you gain an intense calm for the next hour. During this time, you are unable to gain advantage or disadvantage on any roll.

> Although the plant is useful in tense combat situations, I have often imbibed it for personal use. Such times when an incredible calm has served me in the past include (but are not limited to): talking to my publisher, sitting through a mediocre play written by a friend, being forced to eat a meal with one of my critics, and being cornered in the washroom by one very overzealous fan (for more on that last anecdote, see Hamund's Hilarious Headaches, volume XIV).
