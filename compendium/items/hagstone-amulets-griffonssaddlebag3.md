# Hagstone Amulets
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Hagstone-Amulets.webp#right)  


A hagstone is a naturally occurring stone that's pockmarked with holes and crystalline veins. To be transformed into a magical hagstone amulet, it must be made by a hag. If a hag decides to give away one of these amulets, it always comes at a price.

On its own, a hagstone amulet does nothing. However, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to bind three or more amulets. If three or more bound hagstone amulets are worn by different creatures that are within 30 feet of one another, those creatures can use an action to cast either [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md) or [lightning bolt](compendium/spells/lightning-bolt.md) from their amulet (save DC 13). Alternatively, a creature can cast [counterspell](compendium/spells/counterspell.md) from the amulet as a reaction, using a spellcasting ability modifier of +3.

Once a spell has been cast from an amulet, that spell can't be cast again from it or any other hagstone amulet bound to it until the next dawn.
