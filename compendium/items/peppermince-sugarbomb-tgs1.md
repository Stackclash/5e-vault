# Peppermince Sugarbomb
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Peppermince-Sugarbomb.webp#right)  


This hard, minty sugarbomb slowly dissolves in your mouth over the course of 1 hour. At any point, you can use a bonus action to crunch down and break the sugarbomb into tiny, painful shards. You take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage from the shards, but are temporarily enchanted by the candy. While enchanted, your piercing and slashing weapon attacks deal an extra 2 damage to any target hit by them. After 1 minute, the enchantment fades.

## Upset Stomach

You can only be under the effects of 1 sugarbomb that has this feature at a time. Eating a sugarbomb that has this feature while under the effects of another one causes the effects of the first sugarbomb to immediately end and be replaced by the new one's. This rapid change is difficult to stomach, forcing you to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain the effects of the new sugarbomb, but become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. On a success, you gain the effects of the new sugarbomb and are not poisoned.
