# Flesh of Dendallen
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Flesh-of-Dendallen.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

This patchwork shirt is made of enchanted pieces of stitched-together flesh. This shirt has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing this shirt, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cast [false life](compendium/spells/false-life.md), regardless of its usual casting time. In addition, while you have less than half your hit points left, you regain hit points equal to `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) at the beginning of each of your turns. You do not regain health if you are [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) or have taken fire or radiant damage since the beginning of your last turn.

## Curse

When you attune to the shirt and wear it, you're forced to make a DC 20 Strength saving throw as the fleshy fabric begins to bubble and hiss as it fuses to your skin. On a success, you're able to safely remove the clothing before you attune to the item, but are aware of the curse's effects. On a failure, the shirt attaches to your flesh and destroys any nonmagical clothing covered by it. Magical items worn beneath it rise to the surface as the fleshy shirt seeps through them to attach to your skin. While wearing it, you are considered to be undead in addition to any other creature type you already are and are vulnerable to radiant damage.

Once you are attuned to the shirt, you cannot remove it unless you are targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. When you remove it, you take `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) necrotic damage as the shirt is peeled from your skin.
