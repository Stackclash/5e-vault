# Monster Tamer's Shield
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Monster-Tamers-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This shield punishes certain creatures for their hostility and comes from a culture whose dominion is in direct competition with powerful beasts. While holding this shield, whenever you take damage from a melee attack made by a beast or monstrosity, that creature takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) psychic damage. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks.

## Tamer's Protection

If you are also attuned to the [monster tamer's sword](compendium/items/monster-tamers-sword-griffonssaddlebag2.md) and are holding this shield, any creature captured by the sword gains a +1 bonus to its AC and can't be charmed.
