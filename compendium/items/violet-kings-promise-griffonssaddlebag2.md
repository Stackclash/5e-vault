# Violet King's Promise
*Weapon ([rapier](compendium/items/rapier.md)), major, legendary (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, paladin, or ranger)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Violet-Kings-Promise.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This elegant brass rapier was originally wielded by a beloved king, whose empathy and care for his subjects lives on within the blade. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage. In addition, you can use this rapier as a spellcasting focus.

The rapier has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, a number of gems inside the guard equal to the weapon's remaining charges glow red. When you expend a charge from the rapier, it releases a plume of dark smoke from one of the gems.

If an attacker makes a spell attack against you or a target within 5 feet of you while you're holding the rapier, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses and was a spell of 1st level or higher, the rapier regains 1 expended charge.

While holding the rapier, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to give one of three decrees that affect the flow of magic and battle:

## "Clemency"

When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause a different creature within 10 feet of the original target to regain `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) hit points per spell level. When you do, each creature has advantage on the next ability check or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

## "Condemn"

When you cast a spell that deals damage to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause that target as well as a different creature within 10 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) fire damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much fire damage and makes its next attack roll as normal.

## "Overrule"

After you roll dice to restore hit points to a single creature or roll damage for a spell attack or attack using this weapon, you can expend up to 2 charges (no action required) to change the result of those dice. For each charge you spend, you can use the highest number possible for two of those dice instead of the numbers you rolled.

## Flaw

The Violet King's promise makes its wielder empathic and reluctant to resort to violence. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I am slow to resort to violence, even if it's at the cost of my own safety." In addition, if you are attuned to the weapon for 24 consecutive hours, your soft-heartedness causes you to lose your ferocity and battle-readiness. You have disadvantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks and take a â€“5 penalty to initiative rolls. These effects can be removed with a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell, but not while you are attuned to the weapon.
