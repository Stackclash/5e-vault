- **Properties**: Crafted by

While you are wearing this amulet, you gain a [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet. You may also use the item to cast the [dancing lights](compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md) cantrip, as well as the [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md) and [darkness](compendium/spells/darkness.md) spells. The two latter spells may only be used once each per long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all of these spells.
