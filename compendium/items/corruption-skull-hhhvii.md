# Corruption Skull
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While holding this skull, you may use it to cast the [message](compendium/spells/message.md) spell without using any components.

Once per day, when you cast [message](compendium/spells/message.md) in this way, you may also choose to force your target to succeed a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for the next 24 hours. While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, their alignment changes to evil, and any [Persuasion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) (Charisma) checks you make to convince them to perform an evil act is rolled at advantage. The charm ends after 24 hours, or if you do anything to directly harm the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature.
