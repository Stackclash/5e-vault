# Ring of Roses
*Ring, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Roses.webp#right)  


As an action, you can cause a single rose to grow and appear in your hand. The stem is 1 foot long and has small, dull thorns. The flower is odorless and blooms in a color of your choice, but withers and turns to dust after 24 hours.
