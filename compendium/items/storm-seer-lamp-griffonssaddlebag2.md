# Storm Seer Lamp
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Storm-Seer-Lamp.webp#right)  


This crystal lantern gives off a faint, refreshing smell that reminds you of being near the ocean. As a bonus action, you can touch the crystal to cause it to glow, casting bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. You can alter the radius or cause the light to fade using a bonus action to touch the crystal again. Once the lamp has glowed for a total of 8 hours, it can't be used again in this way until the next dusk.

In addition, the lamp can detect incoming storms up to 3 hours before they arrive. If an approaching storm would affect the area within 1 mile of the lamp, the crystal's light becomes an eerie, cold gray.
