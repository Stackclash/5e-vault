While wearing this armor, you have a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, while wearing this armor in dim light or darkness, you may take the [Hide](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action. If you take the [Hide](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) action in this way, you do not suffer the usual penalty that normally applies to Stealth (Dexterity) checks made in plate armor.
