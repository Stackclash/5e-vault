# Hat Trick
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Hat-Trick.webp#right)  


This gaudy purple hat allows the wearer to perform some minor magical feats. The hat has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While holding the hat, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to cast the [find familiar](compendium/spells/find-familiar.md) spell from it, pulling the familiar from the hat. The summoned familiar must take the form of either a rabbit or dove, using the statistics for a [weasel](compendium/bestiary/beast/weasel.md) or [owl](compendium/bestiary/beast/owl.md), respectively. The familiar remains for up to 1 minute, instead of its normal duration, and cannot be used to deliver spells.

In addition, while wearing the hat, you can use an action to cast the [prestidigitation](compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md) spell from it. When cast in this way, the spell can only be used to create harmless, illusory effects.
