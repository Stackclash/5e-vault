# Mace of the Iron Crown
*Weapon ([mace](compendium/items/mace.md)), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Mace-of-the-Iron-Crown.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This dark iron mace is topped with a ring of menacing spikes. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Whenever you hit a humanoid with this weapon for the first time, an illusory circlet appears atop its head. The circlet has a single spike at its forefront when it appears. Each time you hit that creature with the mace, another spike appears on the circlet. Once the third spike appears, that creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes confused. On a successful save, the creature isn't confused, but must make the saving throw again the first time each turn that another spike appears on the crown. A creature automatically succeeds if it is immune to being [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed).

At the start of each of its turns, a confused creature has a 50 percent chance to be overcome with temporary madness. A creature overcome by this madness considers its allies to be enemies until the start of its next turn; it's friendly to you and your companions for the duration or until you harm it.

The crown vanishes and the effect ends after 1 minute or after the third time the creature has either succeeded on the saving throw or hasn't become maddened at the start of its turn; the creature is then immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
