# Sticky Fig
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A strain of fig identifiable by the way it glistens like a diamond in the desert sun, the shiny veneer of this fruit is actually a hardened, sticky mucus that it produces as a method to reduce water-loss. While it is edible, the fruit is quite unpleasant, due to its interior texture that can be best described as a spider-web covered in snot. Beyond that, the fruit also has an odd effect on creatures that imbibe it, causing them to excrete the same mucus from their lower extremities, giving them a surer grip in treacherous environments.

## Effect:

As an action, you may eat this herb. For the next hour, you produce a sticky mucus that adheres you to the surface you stand on, giving you advantage on any saving throw or ability check to avoid being moved against your will, as well as giving you a climb speed equal to your walk speed.
