# Hour and Minute
*Melee weapon ([dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement)*

These two magical weapons are bound by a powerful force. Despite there being two weapons, you only need to attune to one of them to use their properties. While holding one of the weapons, you can use an action to determine the distance and direction of the other paired weapon as long as you're on the same plane of existence.

If you attune to one of the weapons while another creature is attuned to the other, you are each aware of the other creature's attunement and must make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. The creature that wins the contest remains attuned to the item, and for the next 24 hours, its attunement cannot be broken by another creature attempting to attune to the other weapon. The creature that loses the contest is no longer attuned to the weapon.

While holding both weapons in either hand, you gain several benefits:

- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons.  
- Your perception of time is slightly quickened: allowing you to dodge attacks that would have normally hit you. You gain a +1 bonus to AC.  
- When you roll a 20 on an attack roll using Hour (the [dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md)) against a creature, that creature is subjected to the effect of the [slow](compendium/spells/slow.md) spell until the end of your next turn.  
- When you roll a 20 on an attack roll using Minute (the [shortsword](compendium/items/shortsword.md)), you gain the effect of the [haste](compendium/spells/haste.md) spell until the start of your next turn. When the effect ends, you don't suffer the normal effects of the spell ending.  
- In addition, you can use an action to lay the two weapons down on the ground. When you do, they magically point north before spinning around to align and tell the current time. When they do, 12:00 is always facing north.
