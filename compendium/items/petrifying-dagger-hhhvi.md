# Petrifying Dagger
*Weapon ([dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md)), uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)

If this dagger strikes any non-living organic matter that is smaller than half a cubic foot in volume, it is instantly turned to stone for 24 hours.

If a tiny creature is hit by this dagger, they must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw against being magically [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified). On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 24 hours.
