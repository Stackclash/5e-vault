# Amulet of Dragonkin
*Wondrous item, common*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This amulet is the same color as the [guard drake](compendium/bestiary/dragon/guard-drake-mpmm.md) from whom it was crafted. While wearing this amulet, your appearance takes on a more dragon-like aesthetic. You grow patches of scales over your body (the same color as the amulet), your eyes become lizard-like, your teeth grow sharper and you grow a foot-long, prehensile tail from your back. You gain no other benefits from this amulet, however. All these attributes disappear instantly if the amulet is removed.
