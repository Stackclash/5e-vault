This curved blade was carved from a large viper's fang. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) poison damage. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage and is [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the start of your next turn. The [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison damage and isn't [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned).
