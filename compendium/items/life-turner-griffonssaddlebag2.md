# Life Turner
*Wondrous item, minor, legendary*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Life-Turner.webp#right)  


This tiny, spinning hourglass has six seconds' worth of sand inside it and can be easily held or worn as a pendant. When a creature that you can see within 120 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to speak the hourglass's command word and spin it, allowing you to immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. At the end of your turn, the dead creature returns to life with a number of hit points equal to your current hit point total (up to its hit point maximum), and you die. If the dead creature was prone, it can immediately stand up (no action required). Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 1 year has passed.

When you die as a result of using the hourglass, your body is enchanted by protective magic for 3 hours. During this time, if a spell, such as [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md), has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you. In addition, while you're protected by this magic, you are also under the effect of the [gentle repose](compendium/spells/gentle-repose.md) spell.
