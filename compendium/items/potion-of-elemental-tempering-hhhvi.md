# Potion of Elemental Tempering
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, you become comfortable even if you are in extreme weather. For the next 24 hours, you automatically succeed any saving throw against [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) triggered by being in an extremely cold or an extremely hot environment. This potion is constantly bubbling as if boiling and also has a small shard of ice in it that never melts despite the ambient temperature.
