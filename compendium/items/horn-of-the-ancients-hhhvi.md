# Horn of the Ancients
*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

You may spend your action to blow this horn. If you do, a magical roar is emitted from the horn which can be heard from a distance of 300 feet. Each creature (except the blower of the horn) that can hear the horn is subjected to a certain effect. The effect of the horn changes depending on how many times the horn has been blown that day. Once this horn has been used 3 times in one day, it cannot be blown again for 7 days.

- **First Blow.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#deafened) and [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature is [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 8d10|avg` (`8d10`) thunder damage and is knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).
