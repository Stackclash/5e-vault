# Ashfree Birch
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

While most birch trees are actually renowned for how long and hot they burn, the ashfree birch lives up to its name by actually doing the exact oppositeâ€”it vanishes almost instantly once exposed to heat. This is due to the composition of its bark which contains tiny ice crystals inside each cell. When exposed to heat, these cells rupture and release the trapped ice within, thereby neutralising the flame but also making it look like the bark simply disappeared into a puff of steam. While this may seem useless, the bark is actually quite useful as an insulation material and is often found in arctic villages being used to manage campfires and other open flames.

## Effect:

You may spend 10 minutes placing sheets of this bark to wear underneath your armour and clothes, insulating you against heat and fire. If you do so, whenever you take fire damage, this herb absorbs that damage instead of you. This herb can absorb up to 30 points of fire damage before completely burning away and becoming useless; with any excess damage transferred to you instead. You may remove this herb by spending 1 minute peeling it out of your clothes.
