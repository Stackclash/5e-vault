# Pearl of Wisdom Quiver
*Wondrous item, adventuring gear, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Pearl-of-Wisdom-Quiver.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magical quiver is made from the shell of an enormous oyster. Arrows you pull from it are considered magical and are coated with a pearlescent, hydrophobic coating. Ranged weapon attacks made with these arrows ignore the normal penalties of underwater fighting. These arrows become nonmagical once they hit a target or are held by a creature other than you. In addition, you can speak the quiver's command word to cause it to create a magical pearl. You can hold onto this pearl or give it to another creature. When a creature with the pearl makes a Wisdom ability check or saving throw, that creature can choose to make the roll with advantage. When it does, the pearl turns to dust. The pearl is visibly magical and disintegrates on its own after 24 hours if left unused. Once the quiver produces a pearl in this way, it can't produce another one until the following dawn.
