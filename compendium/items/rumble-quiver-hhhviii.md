# Rumble Quiver
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This magical quiver can store up to thirty arrows or bolts. Ammunition drawn from this quiver is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, so long as it is fired within the same turn as it was drawn. As a bonus action, you may speak the quiver's command word, causing it to enchant the next piece of ammunition that you draw from it. If this enchanted ammunition successfully hits a creature, all other creatures within 5 feet of the initial target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or suffer `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) thunder damage. If the ammunition does not strike a creature by the end of your turn, the enchantment on it ends.
