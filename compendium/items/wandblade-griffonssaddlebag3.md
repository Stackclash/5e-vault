You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls using this magic dagger. Its hollow blade is made of magical glass, and its handle can be unscrewed to reveal a space for a single wand. It takes an action to remove a wand from the dagger or to insert one into it. While a wand is inside the dagger, you can use the weapon as either a dagger or wand while holding it. When you use an action for any of the wand's properties or to cast a spell from it, you can immediately use a bonus action to make a single weapon attack using the dagger.
