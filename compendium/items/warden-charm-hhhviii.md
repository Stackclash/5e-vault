# Warden Charm
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This stone charm contains the remains of an eidolon's spirit which does its best to protect whoever is wearing it. If a creature within 5 feet of you attempts to attack you while you are [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and wearing this item, the spirit within the charm emerges to protect you, forcing the attacking creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacking creature suffers `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) force damage and is forced to pick a new target; wasting the attack if they fail to do so.
