This massive, beast-hunting crossbow is carried with its two handles from above instead of by being held from below. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This crossbow uses twice the normal amount of ammunition each time you fire it and deals an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) piercing damage to any target it hits. The weapon emits a [roc](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/roc.md)-like screech that's audible out to 100 feet each time it's fired.

This crossbow is blessed with the spirits of great ancestral hunters. The weapon has 5 charges and regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you attack a Huge or smaller creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack. If the attack hits, the creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, its speed is reduced to 0 and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
