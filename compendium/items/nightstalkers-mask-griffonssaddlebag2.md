# Nightstalker's Mask
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Nightstalkers-Mask.webp#right)  


This demon-faced mask has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the mask, you can expend 1 of its charges when you take the [Hide](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) action to become [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the end of your next turn. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. If you make an attack against a creature while invisible in this way and hit, the target takes an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage.
