This pair of daggers is made using the harvested fangs of a large, venomous spider. When you hit the same creature on your turn with both daggers, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take an extra `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) poison damage and become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the end of its next turn.
