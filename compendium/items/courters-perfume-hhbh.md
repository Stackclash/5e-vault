# Courter's Perfume
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A cream coloured rose able to attract insects of all kinds by magically adapting its scent to any creature that smells it. Due to this property, it is a popular flower sold during the spring months when a number of enthusiastic young people enter the streets looking to woo the person of their dreams (but whom they have not bothered talking to long enough to actually figure out what kind of scents they like yet).

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, any creature that smells you, perceives you to smell like their favourite scent.
