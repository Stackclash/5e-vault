# Dress of Defense
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Dress-of-Defense.webp#right)  


This dress has several decorative armor plates adorning it, but is otherwise made of layers of lush and sheer fabric. While wearing this dress, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wearing no armor. You can use a [shield](compendium/items/shield.md) and still gain this benefit. As a bonus action, you can speak the dress' command word to cause its armored plates to emit a protective magical force, causing the bonus to increase to +3 for 1 minute. Once this property of the dress has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
