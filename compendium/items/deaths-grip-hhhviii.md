# Death's Grip
*Weapon ([pike](compendium/items/pike.md)), very rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d10 P
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. When you hit a target with this weapon on your turn, you may immediately use your bonus action to attempt to [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) them, using this weapon instead of a free hand. If your target is a creature with less than half of its maximum hit points, your [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) check is made with advantage, and if it is successful, your target is considered [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) as well.

While you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) in this way, you may not make attacks with this weapon.
