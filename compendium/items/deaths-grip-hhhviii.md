# Death's Grip
*Melee Weapon, very rare, Crafted by*

- **Properties**: Crafted by, [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. When you hit a target with this weapon on your turn, you may immediately use your bonus action to attempt to [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#grapple) them, using this weapon instead of a free hand. If your target is a creature with less than half of its maximum hit points, your [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#grapple) check is made with advantage, and if it is successful, your target is considered [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) as well.

While you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way, you may not make attacks with this weapon.
