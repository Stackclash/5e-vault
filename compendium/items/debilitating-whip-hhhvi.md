# Debilitating Whip
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This whip has 6 wicked tails made from a roper tendril that still had its hair-like growths intact. The wielder of this whip may choose to make a [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) check using the whip instead of their free hand.

A creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by this whip is considered [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) on top of being [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) and has disadvantage on all Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
