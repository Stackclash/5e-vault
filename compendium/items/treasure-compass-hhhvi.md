# Treasure Compass
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This compass possesses three unblinking xorn eyes embedded in a wooden disk. The eyes look in the direction of the closest source of metal or precious gems within a 20-foot radius. This range is doubled for any magical metal, magical stones, adamantine, and mithral. By holding the compass, you may mentally command it to ignore certain metal and gem sources, such as your own armor.
