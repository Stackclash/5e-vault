# Lenses of Hypnosis
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing these lenses, you may spend an action to project a 30-foot cone of magical energy. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for 1 minute. While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, the target tries to get as close to you as possible, using its actions to [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) until it is within 5 feet of you. A [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
