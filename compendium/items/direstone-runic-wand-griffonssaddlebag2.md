# Direstone Runic Wand
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Direstone-Runic-Wand.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A rigid stone wand used by the arcane dwarves of the Direstone mines. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to trace one of the following runes in the air to invoke its properties (spell save DC 15):

## Algiz

You can expend 3 charges to grant 1 creature you can see within 10 feet of you resistance to fire damage for 1 hour.

## Eihwaz

You can expend 2 charges to cast the [arcane lock](compendium/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell. When you use this spell to lock a second object, the spell ends on the first one.

## Hagalaz

You can expend 2 charges to cast the [shatter](compendium/spells/shatter.md) spell.

## Kenaz

You can expend 1 charge to cast the [burning hands](compendium/spells/burning-hands.md) spell, or 2 charges to cast the [heat metal](compendium/spells/heat-metal.md) spell.

## Raidho

You can expend 4 charges to cast the [stone shape](compendium/spells/stone-shape.md) spell. This version of the spell can alter the form of either stone or natural metal (such as iron or silver).

Alternatively, you can use the wand to cast the [illusory script](compendium/spells/illusory-script.md) spell over the course of 1 minute by expending 1 of its charges, but can only use it to write on stone or metal surfaces.

The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into stone dust. If you are not a [dwarf](compendium/races/dwarf.md) when this happens, you must also succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) until freed by the [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.
