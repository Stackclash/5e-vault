# Staff of the Four Seasons
*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-the-Four-Seasons.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magical staff changes with the seasons. You can spend 10 minutes concentrating on the staff to change it to a different season. It remains in this new form for the next 8 hours before reverting to the current season again.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, your melee attacks with the staff deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold (Winter), radiant (Spring), fire (Summer), or necrotic (Autumn) damage based on its season as long as there is at least 1 charge remaining on the staff.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (depending on its season) using your spell attack modifier and spell save DC:

## Winter

[Color spray](compendium/spells/color-spray.md) (1 charge), [darkvision](compendium/spells/darkvision.md) (2 charges), [sleet storm](compendium/spells/sleet-storm.md) (3 charges)

## Spring

[Guiding bolt](compendium/spells/guiding-bolt.md) (1 charge), [moonbeam](compendium/spells/moonbeam.md) (2 charges), [plant growth](compendium/spells/plant-growth.md) (3 charges)

## Summer

[Burning hands](compendium/spells/burning-hands.md) (1 charge), [spike growth](compendium/spells/spike-growth.md) (2 charges), [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) (3 charges)

## Autumn

[Inflict wounds](compendium/spells/inflict-wounds.md) (1 charge), [pass without trace](compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md) (2 charges), [vampiric touch](compendium/spells/vampiric-touch.md) (3 charges)

The staff regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff loses all foliage and vitality, becoming a gnarled, nonmagical quarterstaff.
