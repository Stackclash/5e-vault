# Circlet of Blasting
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](compendium/items/img/circlet-of-blasting.webp#right)  


While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the [scorching ray](compendium/spells/scorching-ray.md) spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)`. The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
