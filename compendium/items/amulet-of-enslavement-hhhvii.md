# Amulet of Enslavement
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While you are wearing this amulet, any [charm](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) effect that currently afflicts you is considered to have an infinite duration instead of its usual duration. Once this amulet has been worn for a cumulative total of 24 hours, it crumbles into dust and becomes worthless.
