- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This stony staff has been carved into the shape of a castle tower. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties, which use your spell save DC and spell attack bonus, and regains `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, a the staff crumbles into rubble and is destroyed.

## Battering Strike

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. When you hit with a melee attack using this staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the target to take an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it's also pushed 5 feet away from you. In addition, when you attack an object with the staff and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

## Fire Pot

While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast the [grease](compendium/spells/grease.md) spell from it. You can increase the size of the square covered by the spell by 5 feet for each additional charge you expend in this way (up to a 20-foot square). When you expend 2 or more charges to cast the spell in this way, creatures also take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Trebuchet

While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 3 charges to magically create and fling a boulder at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Any target within 5 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) bludgeoning damage, and if it's Medium or smaller, it is also pushed 10 feet away from the point. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. Maximize the bludgeoning damage dice against any object or structure hit by the boulder. After it lands, the boulder disappears.
