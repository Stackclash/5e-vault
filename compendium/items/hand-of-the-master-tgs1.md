# Hand of the Master
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Hand-of-the-Master.webp#right)  


This satin glove has no visible seams and can be easily flipped inside-out to wear on either a left or right hand. While attuned to the glove, you can fit it over a hand that is either missing fingers or missing entirely and have it function as a normal body part.

In addition, you can cast the [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) cantrip at will using the glove. When you do, the spectral hand originates within the glove instead of at a point of your choosing. The glove covers the spectral hand as it carries out your commands, leaving your hand or limb uncovered while it does so. Casting *mage hand* using the glove doesn't require any verbal components and doubles both the duration and carrying capacity of the hand.
