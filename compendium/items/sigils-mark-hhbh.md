# Sigil's Mark
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

A type of gorse identified by the copper-brown flowers, shaped into a ring resembling the wards of the cosmic plane of Sigil. Found only on the edge of beaches in which the sand turns to soil, it is said that they were planted by the neutral judges of the cosmos as part of a demarcation of territory in a long forgotten judgement between sea and land. Regardless of its origin, this plant certainly embodies the neutrality of Sigil, as the oil within them contains a magical neutralising agent that seems to stabilise the random whims of fate, reducing all actions to simple, fair outcomes.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) seeds. As an action, you may crush a seed and rub the resulting oil on yourself, or you may use a seed to make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 20 feet of you, destroying it and releasing the oil upon impact. Either way, a creature covered by this oil becomes insulated from the winds of fate for the next hour. During this time, whenever the covered creature would make a roll using a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`), they instead skip the roll and act as if they rolled a 10 instead.
