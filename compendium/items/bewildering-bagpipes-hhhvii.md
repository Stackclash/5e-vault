# Bewildering Bagpipes
*Wondrous item, instrument, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This set of [bagpipes](compendium/items/bagpipes.md) creates a sound similar to that of a grung's chirr when used. If a bard uses this instrument as a spellcasting focus while attempting to [cast a spell](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Cast%20a%20Spell) that would impose the [charm](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition on a target, the range of that spell is doubled.
