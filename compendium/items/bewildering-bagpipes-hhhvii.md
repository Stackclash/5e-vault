# Bewildering Bagpipes
*Instrument, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This set of [bagpipes](compendium/items/bagpipes.md) creates a sound similar to that of a grung's chirr when used. If a bard uses this instrument as a spellcasting focus while attempting to [cast a spell](/compendium/rules/actions.md#cast%20a%20spell) that would impose the [charm](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition on a target, the range of that spell is doubled.
