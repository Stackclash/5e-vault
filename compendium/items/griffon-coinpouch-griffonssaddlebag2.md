# Griffon Coinpouch
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Griffon-Coinpouch.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This stylized purse is sewn and stitched in the style of [the griffon's saddlebag](compendium/items/the-griffons-saddlebag-tgs1.md), a classic treasure and character from children's stories and legends. The purse is 6 inches across and holds up to 1,000 coins. Coins taken from the purse are miraculously clean and shiny, as if freshly minted. The bag always weighs 1 pound, regardless of the number of coins within it.

At the GM's discretion, a small slip of parchment can be found folded among the coins inside. The parchment can have anything on it, although it usually carries enigmatic warnings or peculiar words of guidance. The GM can write their own notes, or you can roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) and consult the table below to determine what the parchment says:

`dice: [](griffon-coinpouch-griffonssaddlebag2.md#^message)`

| dice: d8 | Message |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Falling rocks play to the rhythm of catastrophe. |
| 2 | Whether or not you succeed, you can certainly try. |
| 3 | Draughts are meant to be drunk. |
| 4 | Strength in numbers. |
| 5 | Acid, fire, and diamonds can solve most problems. |
| 6 | Not all strangers are trustworthy. |
| 7 | Asking for directions is not a sign of weakness. |
| 8 | Keep on adventuring. |
