This hand crossbow has a small spring-loaded case of 6 bolts attached to its side that automatically reload the crossbow whenever it's fired. While the case has bolts in it, the crossbow ignores its loading property. Once the case is empty, a creature can use an action to reload it with another 6 bolts.

As an action, you can unfurl the crossbow's three collapsible legs and plant it firmly on the ground to become a Small defensive construct. Once deployed, the crossbow magically draws itself and loads the next bolt in its case, if any. While you're within 30 feet of the crossbow, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to command it to attack a target you can see within 30 feet of it. The crossbow uses your attack roll and ability score modifier for its damage rolls. The first time an invisible creature enters a space within 30 feet of the crossbow on its turn, the crossbow emits a small chirping sound audible out to 100 feet.

The deployed crossbow has 30 hit points, AC 12, and automatically fails Dexterity and Strength saving throws but passes all others. If it's reduced to 0 hit points, it falls over and can't be deployed again in this way for 1 minute. You can quickly retrieve the deployed crossbow using a bonus action when you enter the same space as it.
