# Cloak of the Boundless Spirit
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Cloak-of-the-Boundless-Spirit.webp#right)  


This swirling, translucent cloak bolsters the fighting spirits of friendly nearby creatures. The cloak has 3 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. When an ally you can see within 15 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and reduce that damage by `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`).

In addition, friendly creatures within 15 feet of you regain consciousness on a roll of 19 or 20 on death saving throws. When a creature within range regains consciousness in this way, you can use a reaction to expend 1 charge to grant them `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) temporary hit points. Once a creature regains consciousness by rolling a 19 or 20 on a death saving throw in this way, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.
