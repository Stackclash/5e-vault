# Leeching Whip
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

When you hit a Huge or smaller sized creature with this weapon, you may make a [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) check against them as a free action, using this whip to [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) instead of your free hand. While you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) in this way, you may not attack with this weapon. If you have a creature [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by this weapon, you may spend an action to force that creature to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) necrotic damage. In addition, if a creature fails their saving throw, a vial's worth of their blood becomes stored in the whip, which you may harvest as an action without requiring a check. This whip can only store one vial's worth of blood at a time.
