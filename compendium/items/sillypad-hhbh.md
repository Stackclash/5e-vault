# Sillypad
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A magical type of lilypad that is indistinguishable from its mundane counterparts apart from a faint sound of whimsical music that seems to emanate from it at all times. It is undoubtedly the product of a trickster god, as its effects when applied to the skin can be described as nonsensical at best.

## Effect:

As an action you may rub this herb on your skin. If you do so, you undergo a random, harmless transformation determined by rolling on the table below. This effect lasts for 4 hours or until a [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic is cast on you, after which you revert back to your normal form.
