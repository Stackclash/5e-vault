The blade of this longsword seems to glow white, like it is a beam of light hammered into the shape of a sword. Its hilt is gold-plated and has three embedded sapphires. This longsword has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Additionally, it gains one charge whenever an attack made with it deals more than 20 damage in a single blow. It can hold up to 3 charges, but all unused charges disappear when you take a long rest.

While the sword holds any charges, it radiates bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an extra 20 feet. As an action, you can expend any number of charges to restore hit points to a creature you can touch with the sword's blade. Expending 1 charge restores 10 hit points, expending 2 charges restores 20 hit points, and expending 3 charges restores 40 hit points.
