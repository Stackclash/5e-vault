# Moon Muzzle Mixture
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

Drinking this potion completely cures a creature of [Player Characters as Lycanthropes](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/player-characters-as-lycanthropes.md) if taken before that creature experiences its first full moon as a lycanthrope. If drunk after that, or if drunk by a natural born lycanthrope, a lycanthrope is able to ignore the usual transformative effects of the full moon for the next 28 days.
