# Armor of the Infernal Enforcer
*Light armor ([studded leather armor](compendium/items/studded-leather-armor.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + Dex modifier
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

You gain a +3 bonus to AC while wearing this armor and you gain resistance to cold, fire, and poison damage. In addition, when you take damage you may use your reaction to cause an infernal sound to bellow forth from the armor, forcing all creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that saves against this effect is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Once you use this ability once, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
