# Anti-Magic Crystal
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This roughly basket sized crystal radiates a field of energy that disrupts the normal flow of the multiverse and prevents magical forces from acting in its proximity. This crystal creates an area of antimagic around itself, as in the [antimagic field](compendium/spells/antimagic-field.md) spell, in a 150-foot radius. This field passes through all solid objects except a layer of lead that is at least 1 inch thick.

This crystal cannot be deactivated (including in other antimagic fields) and only stops functioning if it is destroyed. The crystal has 30 hit points, 15 AC and is immune to poison and psychic damage.
