*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Retaliating-Bloom-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This steel shield hides a slim chamber in its center where magical flora grow and release toxic pollen. The chamber is covered with an intricate, interlocking series of metal plates and flaps that, once released, resembles a flower.

While holding the shield, you can use your reaction when a Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack to release the chamber's mechanism and fire the toxic pollen into the face of the attacker. When you do, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk, when the flowers release another wave of pollen.

Curious, whirring mechanisms inside the shield automatically retract the chamber's unfurled metallic plates at dusk. Alternatively, you can manually collapse the shield's plates over the course of 1 minute.
