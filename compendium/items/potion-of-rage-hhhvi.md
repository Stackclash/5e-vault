# Potion of Rage
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, any Strength melee weapon attack you make gains a +2 bonus to its damage roll and is rolled at advantage, however any attack made against you is also rolled with advantage. In addition, anytime you are damaged by a creature you can see, you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to spend your next action making a melee weapon [attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) against the creature that damaged you, using your movement speed to get as close to them as possible, including any potential [dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action. This potion is a bright red with angry bubbles constantly rising to its surface.
