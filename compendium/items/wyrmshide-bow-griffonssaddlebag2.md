This bow is crafted with delicate dragon scales and strung with a fiber from a dragon's heart. While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word and channel the energy of the dragon within. When you do, the bow forms a draconic cowl of elemental energy around you. For the duration of the cowl, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain 25 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute.  
- You have resistance to damage of the same type as the elemental energy of the cowl. The type of energy is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the bow's scales, as shown on the table below.  
- On a hit, the bow deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) damage of the same type as the cowl's energy. If the target is a dragon, this extra damage ignores any resistance or immunity it has against that damage type.  

The cowl remains until you lose all these temporary points. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn or until the bow is used to slay or help slay a Large or larger dragon. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.
