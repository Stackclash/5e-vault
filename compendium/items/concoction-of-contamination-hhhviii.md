# Concoction of Contamination
*Potion, very rare, Crafted by*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVIII/ConcoctionofContamination.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This pale green potion constantly appears to form clots of material inside it that quickly turn grey and dissolve back into the liquid. For 1 hour after you drink this potion, your blood becomes a dangerous disease-carrying fluid. This does not harm you, but it does grant you the following abilities:

- You are immune to disease and poison.  
- Any time a creature within 5 feet deals piercing or slashing damage to you, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage as your infected blood splashes onto them.  
- Any creature that drinks at least one ounce of your blood must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). While [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a creature suffers `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) poison damage at the start of each of their turns. A [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature may make the saving throw again at the end of their turn, ending the effect on themselves on a success. Your blood is tasteless, odorless, and mostly colorless when mixed into other fluids and can only be detected in a drink by a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.
