# Turtle Brooch
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Turtle-Brooch.webp#right)  


This gold and amber brooch resembles a turtle that's been flipped on its back. While you're wearing it, standing up from being [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) costs 5 feet less of your movement (to a minimum of 5 feet).
