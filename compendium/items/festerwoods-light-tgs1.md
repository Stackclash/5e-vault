# Festerwood's Light
*Weapon ([rapier](compendium/items/rapier.md)), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Festerwoods-Light.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This festerwood rapier's blade is inlaid with scrapings from the Lightspore, the radiant mushroom growing at the center of the Festerwood. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you're attuned to this rapier, you have advantage on ability checks made to find locations within the Festerwood and are immune to disease. While holding the sword, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet.

You can use an action to raise the blade overhead and speak its command word. When you do, all creatures other than you within 30 feet of you are dusted with a sudden wave of magical spores. A friendly creature affected by the spores is suddenly invigorated, allowing it to immediately use its reaction to either make one weapon attack or move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. A hostile creature affected by the spores must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until the end of your next turn. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

The rapier has 5 charges for the following properties. The weapon regains `dice:1d3+2|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) expended charges daily at dusk.

## Spore Cleansing

As an action, you can touch a willing creature with the rapier and expend 1 of its charges to remove 1 Spore Counter from that creature. (See [risen sporehusk](compendium/bestiary/undead/risen-sporehusk-tgs1.md))

## Spells

While holding this rapier, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 17, spell attack bonus +9): [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md) (4th-level version), [compulsion](compendium/spells/compulsion.md), [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md), [contagion](compendium/spells/contagion.md), [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md), [locate animals or plants](compendium/spells/locate-animals-or-plants.md), or [moonbeam](compendium/spells/moonbeam.md) (4th-level version). In addition, you can use an action to cast the [dancing lights](compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md) spell at will while holding the rapier.
