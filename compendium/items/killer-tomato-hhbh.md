# Killer Tomato
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A herb with a hyperbolic name, the killer tomato is not actually dangerousâ€”not physically at least. Said to have been created by a trickster god in a fit of mirthful cheekiness, this herb is able to sense whenever a bad joke, story, or song is performed around it, and then fly autonomously at the perpetrator to turn their face red with tomato juice. While this is ultimately harmless, the emotional damage this can cause has resulted in the tomato becoming banned from most music halls and taverns.

## Effect:

If a creature fails a Charisma ([Performance](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check within 30 feet of this herb, it automatically flies directly at them and automatically splatters onto them, destroying this herb. This effect also triggers if the herb is on your person and you succeed on a saving throw to resist the effects of a [vicious mockery](compendium/spells/vicious-mockery.md), [Otto's irresistible dance](compendium/spells/ottos-irresistible-dance.md), [Tasha's hideous laughter](compendium/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md), or [danse macabre](compendium/spells/danse-macabre-xge.md) spell, or similar magic based on jokes, music, or performances, with the herb flying at the creature that cast the spell.
