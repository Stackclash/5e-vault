# Tempest Griffon Bracers
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Tempest-Griffon-Bracers.webp#right)  


While wearing these oiled bracers lined with magic griffon feathers, your speed increases by 5 feet.

In addition, you can use an action to speak the bracers' command word to vanish into a plume of sparks and feathers. Choose up to 3 different creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a melee weapon attack against each target, briefly appearing next to each one before making the attack. A target takes an extra `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) lightning damage on a hit, or half as much lightning damage on a miss. You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets or return to your original space, reappearing in a flourish of electricity, feathers, and wind. Once this property of the bracers has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
