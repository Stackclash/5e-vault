# Influential Tunic
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Influential-Tunic.webp#right)  


This shimmering silk tunic creates an air of importance about it. When you make a Charisma check while wearing the tunic, you can roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and add the number rolled to the check; you must decide to do so before the GM determines the outcome. To use this property, you can't be wearing any armor, and you must have led a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle the previous day, as determined by the Lifestyle Expenses table in the Basic Rules. Once this property of the tunic has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
