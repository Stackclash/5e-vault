# Bands of the Found and Lost
*Wondrous item, minor, common*

The compass-like mechanisms on top of these matching leather bracelets remain motionless until each bracelet is worn by a different creature. While they're worn, each compass points in the direction of the other matching band. It doesn't indicate height or depth. The compasses spin wildly if the two bands are worn on different planes of existence.
