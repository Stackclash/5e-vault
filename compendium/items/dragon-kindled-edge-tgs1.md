This magnificent blade is crafted from the remains of an ancient dragon. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns. In addition, while you're attuned to this weapon, you can read and understand draconic.

## Kindled Cleave

When you're affected by a hostile dragon's breath attack, you can use your reaction to hold the blade in front of you. When you do, the sword splits the breath attack and leaves you and any creature in a 30-foot cone behind you unaffected by the attack. Once this features has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

When you use this feature to split a breath attack in this way, the sword gives off an elemental haze like that of the split breath attack. The haze lasts for up to 1 minute and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet. The first creature hit by an attack from the sword while it has this haze takes an extra `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) damage from the attack of the breath attack's damage type. This extra damage ignores resistances and immunity.

## Lesser Draconic Resistance

If you fail a saving throw by 4 or less, you can choose to succeed on it instead. Once this feature of the sword's been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
