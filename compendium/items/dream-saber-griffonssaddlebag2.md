You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and any creature it hits takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) psychic damage. When the damage you deal with this weapon would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to magically cause it to fall asleep, instead of dealing the damage. The sleeping creature is [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for 10 minutes or until it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. When you cause a creature to fall asleep in this way, you can also force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you immediately learn its surface thoughts and can decide what dreams it has while asleep. Once a creature falls asleep in this way, it is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
