# Scorned Heart Breastplate
*Medium armor ([breastplate](compendium/items/breastplate.md)), cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Scorned-Heart-Breastplate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

This brass breastplate is torn apart in its center by a crimson gemstone. You gain a +1 bonus to AC for every two allies within 10 feet of you (up to a maximum of +2) while you wear this armor. In addition, while wearing this armor, you can cast [hellish rebuke](compendium/spells/hellish-rebuke.md) (save DC 15) as a 3rd-level spell from it, using your reaction. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

## Curse

This armor is cursed. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have disadvantage on saving throws to resist becoming charmed, and you have disadvantage on Charisma checks to interact with any creature you find attractive.
