While wearing this dark ceramic mask, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks relying on hearing and smell, as well as on Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks made to interact with dogs and doglike beasts, such as foxes, jackals, and wolves.
