# Spellwoven Robes
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Spellwoven-Robes.webp#right)  


These robes are spun from special, magic-sensitive threads, causing arcane glyphs to appear on the robe while you wear it whenever you cast a spell. While wearing these robes and no other armor, your AC is equal to 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the apparent style, color, and apparent material of the robe. Regardless of its appearance, it is always a robe and its weight remains the same.
