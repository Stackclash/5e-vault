# Guardian Mask
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this mask, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you may use your reaction to cause that attack to hit you instead. In addition, if a creature within 5 feet of you fails a death saving throw, you may use your reaction to turn that failure into a success.
