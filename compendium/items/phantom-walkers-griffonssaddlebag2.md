# Phantom Walkers
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*

While wearing these boots, the DC of any ability checks made to track your movements using your footprints increases by 5.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to cause the boots to leave behind no footprints for 1 minute. When you do, another set of similar footprints appear on the ground that lead in random directions. These footprints last for 8 hours and travel up to 300 feet. A successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check reveals that the footprints are magical. Once this property of the boots has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
