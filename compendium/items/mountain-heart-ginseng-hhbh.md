## Description:

Ginseng has been considered a miracle plant for millennia, lauded for its medicinal and healing properties. However, of all ginseng varieties, one type stands above them all as the literal gold standard in potency. The mountain heart ginseng is instantly recognisable for its intense gold lustre, broken up only by glowing red veins that make the root resemble a nugget of gold fished out of the molten heart of a mountain. Its benefits are well known for boosting one's vitality and immune system, almost as if you are gaining the strength and durability of the mighty mountain itself.

You have advantage on Constitution saving throws for 8 hours after using this herb.
