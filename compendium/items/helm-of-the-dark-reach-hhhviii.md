# Helm of the Dark Reach
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

The spatial bending essence trapped in this helm imparts your magic with extra abilities. This helm has 6 charges. Whenever you cast a spell that targets only one creature and uses an attack roll, you may expend a charge to add any of the following effects to the results of your successful hit:

- Your target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you.  
- Your target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet towards you.  
- Your target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have their speed halved until the start of your next turn.  
- Your target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be marked by spatial energy until the end of your next turn. A creature marked by spatial energy is considered a valid target for all of your spells even if they are out of range or not in your line of sight.  

This helm regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
