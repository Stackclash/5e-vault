This magic dagger teleports back to your hand immediately after you make a ranged attack with it. The dagger has 4 charges, and it regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a creature with this dagger, you can expend 1 of the weapon's charges to mark it for death: you sense the general direction of a marked creature's location, as long as it remains within 1,000 feet of you. If the marked creature is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to teleport to a random unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature and immediately make an attack against it using the dagger. The attack roll is made with advantage. If the target is more than 60 feet away from you or if there are no unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of it, nothing happens, and the action is wasted.

A mark lasts for 10 minutes. The mark ends early if you mark another creature, if you're ever more than 1,000 feet away from it, or if you use the dagger to teleport (even if it fails).
