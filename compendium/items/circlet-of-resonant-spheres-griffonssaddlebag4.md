# Circlet of Resonant Spheres
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a bard or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Circlet-of-Resonant-Spheres.webp#right)  


This metal circlet is surrounded by ten circular openings. Each opening holds a floating metal sphere, which rings softly like a bell when held to your ear. While wearing the circlet, the spheres hover just outside of their respective openings.

Once you attune to the circlet, you can interpret the spheres' soft chimes as a sort of musical language. This language expresses the flow of magic around you, and by understanding it, allows you to change the nature of any spell you cast. While wearing the circlet, you can use an action to cast the detect magic spell from it.

## Arcana Musica

When you attune to the circlet for the first time, you can choose three Metamagic options of your choice from the sorcerer class. While wearing the circlet, you can use one of these options whenever you cast a spell.

The circlet has 10 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Whenever you use a Metamagic option from the circlet, you must expend a number of its charges equal to the amount of Sorcery Points normally required by the option. While wearing the circlet, you can use an action to expend 10 charges from the circlet to replace one of its Metamagic options with a different one.

## Commune with Weave

Alternatively, while wearing the circlet, you can expend 5 of its charges to cast the commune with nature spell from it over the course of 1 minute. This version of the spell allows you to commune with the very magic around you in a 300-foot radius, even in dungeons or towns, instead of the surrounding area's land and flora. As a result, you can ask it up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no and that relate to the magic found within that area. The magic isn't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond its understanding. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead. You must ask your questions within 1 minute of casting the spell.
