Rooting arrows are a type of arrow created by militant druid circles and ranger conclaves. There are multiple types of these arrows, which are described below. After a rooting arrow's been fired from a bow as part of a weapon attack, it continues to grow until its effect occurs at the start of your next turn. Once the effect ends, the arrow withers away and is destroyed. If an arrow hits a target, it remains centered on the target until a creature within reach uses an action to remove it. If an arrow misses a target, it lands in a space at the GM's discretion.

## Floral

This arrow grows into a beautiful, enchanting flower. When its effect occurs, each humanoid within 10 feet of the arrow must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. On a failed save, the humanoid is [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the creature who fired it for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

## Ivy

This arrow grows into a writhing mass of vines. When its effect occurs, each creature within 5 feet of the arrow must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by the vine for 1 minute. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the vine (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the vine. On a successful save, a creature's speed is halved until the end of its next turn as it struggles against the vines.

## Spruce

This arrow grows painful tree needles that burst from it when it finishes growing. When the effect occurs, each creature within 10 feet of the arrow must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
