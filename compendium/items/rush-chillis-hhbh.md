# Rush Chillis
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

A curious, lightning bolt shaped chilli that grows on spindly yellow stalks. Imbibing these chillis gives a creature a greater sense of mental acuity that improves reflexes. This fact, combined with its incredible rarity, has led to its appearance in a multitude of myths and local legends as a plant gifted to heroes by the gods to fulfil their epic quests. Unfortunately, although these chillis are cultivable, only the wild chillis possess the special reaction-enhancing property. The reason for this is yet unknown.

## Effect:

For 1 hour after using this herb, you can perform up to 2 reactions per round that you regain at the start of each of your turns.
