# Scholar's Brush
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A wonderfully thick and luscious variety of rosemary with an attractive, lavender coloured top-brush. The aroma of this herb has a simultaneously calming, yet focusing effect on those that smell it, and it has long been used as a study aid by magical students in order to cram more of their esoteric arts into their heads.

## Effect:

As part of preparing a list of spells during a long rest, you may crush this herb and rub the resulting oil onto your forehead. If you do so, you may prepare one extra spell than you would normally be allowed. This effect lasts until the next time you change your spell list.

Honestly, they should just take a page out of my book and realise that being out in the world is the best way to learn!
