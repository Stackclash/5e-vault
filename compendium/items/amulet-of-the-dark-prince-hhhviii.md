# Amulet of the Dark Prince
*Wondrous item, cursed item, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted Artifact](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20Artifact), [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

The Dark Prince is the master of hedonism, perversion, and twisted indulgences. According to one legend however, the Prince of Pleasure was not always like this. One origin described [Graz'zt](compendium/bestiary/npc/grazzt-mpmm.md) as once having been a mortal man, a prince of legendary beauty, charm, and wit. As the prince aged however, he feared losing these gifts that youth had granted him and so he struck a deal with a dark power to retain his good looks forever. Emboldened by this new sense of immortality, the prince proceeded to indulge in every sensual pleasure he could, further corrupting his heart and soul. Upon his eventual death, he descended to the Abyss where he would go on to charm and manipulate his way until he became the Demon Lord [Graz'zt](compendium/bestiary/npc/grazzt-mpmm.md).

In order to attune to this item, you must wear it while gazing at yourself in a reflective surface. During the time you take to attune to it, you must continue gazing at the reflective surface while also visualizing your ideal form. This form must be the same as your current race, but may possess certain embellishments such as tattoos, markings, and small vestigial body parts like horns. At the end of the attunement, your appearance changes to match that of your ideal form. You remain in this form so long as you are attuned to this item; if your attunement to this item ends, you revert to your original form immediately.

If this amulet imposes a saving throw, it is calculated as 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

## Random Properties

The Amulet of the Dark Prince has the following random properties:

- 2 [major beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) properties  
- 2 [minor beneficial](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) properties  
- 1 [major detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties.md) property  
- 3 [minor detrimental](compendium/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) properties  

## Spellcasting

Using this amulet, you may cast the [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [disguise self](compendium/spells/disguise-self.md), and [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spells at their lowest levels at will. In addition, you may cast the [dominate person](compendium/spells/dominate-person.md) and [dominate monster](compendium/spells/dominate-monster.md) spells at their lowest levels. Both of these spells may be cast once each, after which they cannot be cast again in this way until you finish your next long rest. All spells cast in this way use the save DC of the amulet.

## Dark Trickster

As an action, you may [polymorph](compendium/spells/polymorph.md) into a form that resembles a Medium humanoid of your choice, or back into your true form. Your statistics remain the same in each form and any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. If you are polymorphing into a specific humanoid that you are familiar with, you may also mimic their voice and mannerisms perfectly, preventing anyone noticing that you are not actually them.

## Master of Discord

Whenever you use a spell or feature that allows you to target a creature and inflict the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition on them, you may choose to target up to a number of additional creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). These additional targets must be in range of your spell or feature and each creature makes their saving throw individually.

## Corrupting Charm

While you have a creature [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you, you may use your bonus action to force them to make a saving throw against the save DC of the amulet. On a failure, you may impose one of the following effects:

- The target must roll on [the Madness of Graz'zt table](compendium/bestiary/npc/grazzt-mpmm.md)* ^[See the info tab] and suffer the resulting flaw. This flaw persists until cured as outlined in the [madness](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/madness.md)  
- The target must use its reaction to move up to its speed in a direction you choose.  
- The target enters a trance-like state and drops their guard. Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against that target are made at advantage.  

## Curse

When you become attuned to the amulet, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [the Madness of Graz'zt table](compendium/bestiary/npc/grazzt-mpmm.md)* ^[See the info tab] and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Amulet

This item can only be destroyed by leaving it in a 1-foot cubed lead box lined on the inside with mirrors. The amulet must remain within this box for 100 years, unseen by any creature during that entire time. If the amulet is ever removed from this box or if a creature looks upon the amulet, the process must restart from the beginning. After 100 years, the amulet crumbles into dust and becomes worthless.
