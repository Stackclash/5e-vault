# Wand of the Undergrowth
*Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This wand has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast the [blight](compendium/spells/blight.md) spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 4th-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into compost and is destroyed.

Additionally, you may use an action to plant the wand into soft soil. If you do so, the wand drains the energy of all living beings around it. All creatures and plants within a 30-foot radius of the wand are subjected to a DC 15 [blight](compendium/spells/blight.md) spell (cast at 4th-level). If the total damage dealt to all targets exceeds 65, the wand transforms into a [shambling mound](compendium/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) with the same amount of HP that was just dealt, up to a maximum of 136. This [shambling mound](compendium/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) has no allegiance to any creature around it and will act in its own interest. If the wand did not deal more than 65 damage, the wand simply crumbles into compost and is destroyed.
