# Contagion Plate
*Heavy armor ([plate armor](compendium/items/plate-armor.md)), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVIII/ContagionPlate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, a swim speed equal to your walking speed, you have resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause you to become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). In addition, if you are submerged in a body of water, you may use your bonus action to speak this armor's command word, causing it to emit an aura of contagion for the next 10 minutes that befouls the water 30 feet around you at the start of each of your turns. Befouled water is considered lightly obscured and any creature other than you that consumes or swims in this water must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the effects of this water for 24 hours. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) poison damage and is [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) poison damage and is [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until it finishes a long rest.

You may end this effect early by using your bonus action to speak the command word again, ending the aura and removing any befouling effect on contaminated water.
