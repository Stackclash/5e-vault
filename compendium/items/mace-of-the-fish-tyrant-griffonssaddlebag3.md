# Mace of the Fish Tyrant
*Weapon ([mace](compendium/items/mace.md)), cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mace-of-the-Fish-Tyrant.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

The glass head of this mace is a hollow orb filled with water. Inside the orb is a brilliantly colored fish. Despite the movement of the water sloshing about inside the weapon, the fish remains perfectly still inside it. The fish is immortal while it remains within the mace and can't be affected by magic.

When found, the mace is a very rare magic item with the following properties:

- You have resistance to psychic damage.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  
- Targets hit with the mace take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) psychic damage.  
- If you make an attack with the mace while not attuned to it, you take `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) psychic damage as the fish magically exerts its frustration upon you.  

## Sentience

While the weapon itself is not sentient, the fish within it is lawful evil with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.

The fish can speak, read, and understand Deep Speech, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to the mace, the fish also understands every language you know.

## Personality

While the fish doesn't need to eat, it hungers to be near the minds of intelligent creatures. The more creatures that are near it, the happier it becomes. It speaks with grim certainty of all things and expects to be obeyed. While you are attuned to the mace, the fish knows your greatest desires.

## Curse

This mace is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the mace, keeping it within reach at all times.

You remain cursed until targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or until a [banishment](compendium/spells/banishment.md) spell of 5th level or higher is cast on the mace. When banished in this way, the mace remains, but the fish is returned to its home plane. You can feel a great sense of relief from the fish as it leaves the mace. When this happens, the weapon becomes a regular +1 mace. However, you are granted a permanent boon by the fish as it departs: you gain resistance to psychic damage.
