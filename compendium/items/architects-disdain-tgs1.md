- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This adamantine war pick is specially designed to tear down walls. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever the war pick hits an object or structure, the hit is a critical hit. In addition, if you hit a magically created object or structure, such as a [wall of ice](compendium/spells/wall-of-ice.md), with the war pick, you can choose to dispel the wall or object as if by the [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell (6th-level version). The effect fails if the spell or magical effect that created the object or structure was cast using a 7th-level spell slot or higher. Once the war pick has dispelled a structure in this way, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
