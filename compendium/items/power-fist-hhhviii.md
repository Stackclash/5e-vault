- **Properties**: Crafted by

This iron gauntlet moves with a surprising fluidity and dexterity, despite what its large size would imply. Due to this gauntlet's strength and grip, a hand wearing it is considered to be two hands for the sake of satisfying a weapon's two-handed or versatile properties. In addition, any weapon wielded in that hand is considered to have the light property.
