# Nightflame Seed
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

Scattered on the forest floor are walnut-sized seeds with a distinct purple hue. These are actually immature seeds of the *oleum carealus* tree. While the mature seeds are useful only as a nutritious snack, the prematurely shed ones contain a special oil that causes flames to turn blue and ghostly, as well as lose most of their smoke. While this results in a much more eerie flame, it also becomes much harder to detect from long distances and thus has been used by adventurers that need to travel clandestinely without losing the comfort of a warm campfire in their sleep.

## Effect:

This seed may be thrown into a fire, causing it to turn a dim blue and mostly difficult to see at night without losing any output of heat, as well as preventing it from producing smoke. The flame only produces dim light in a 5-foot radius around it, and any creature attempting a Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to find the flame does so at disadvantage.

> I once had the sublime opportunity to witness the annual backburning of the Ghostwood forestâ€”so named due to the abundance of nightflame seeds that litter its floor. Every year, the local people set fire to the forest to maintain its growth and promote healthy foliage, while simultaneously creating a spectacular and memorably eerie sight as almost-invisible blue flames devour the wood around them. If you can find the opportunity, I highly recommend taking the time to see it for yourself.
