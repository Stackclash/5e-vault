# Gripping Perfume
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Gripping-Perfume.webp#right)  


This 1-ounce bottle of perfume is decorated with a ceramic octopus at its top. Its head is actually a fabric balloon, which allows the holder to spray the perfume through one of the octopus's tentacles. The perfume looks like a dark ink when sprayed, but immediately absorbs into the skin and disappears. It does, however, stain clothing.

You can use an action to spray the perfume on a willing creature within 5 feet of you. For 1 hour, that creature can't be disarmed of any item against its will. For the duration, it also gains a +2 bonus to any ability check it makes to hold onto something, such as pulling an item out of another creature's hands, pickpocketing a key from a guard, or holding onto a stone ledge while climbing.

The bottle has enough perfume for 4 uses.
