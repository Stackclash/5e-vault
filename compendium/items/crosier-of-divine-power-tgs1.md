- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

This staff is enchanted with powerful holy magic that manifests as radiant motes of power during times of need. At the start of each of your turns in combat, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 6, a mote of power appears above the head of the staff. When you hit a target with the staff or heal a creature with a spell or magical effect while holding it, you can expend 1 of these motes to add `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) to the total damage dealt or hit points healed. The extra damage is radiant.

Each mote lasts for 1 minute or until it's expended. When you roll initiative against a hostile creature, the staff creates 2 motes.
