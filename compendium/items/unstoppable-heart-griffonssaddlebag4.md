# Unstoppable Heart
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Unstoppable-Heart.webp#right)  


This smooth, copper device looks a bit like a mechanical heart. Glowing red solution moves through its internal chambers and valves in perfect sequence. As part of attuning to the heart, you must hold it against your chest for the duration. Once you're attuned to it, it magically vanishes within your chest and begins to beat alongside your normal heart.

While inside your body, the heart grants you the following benefits:

- You can move an additional 10 feet whenever you take the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action.  
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist poison and to endure a forced march.  
- You have resistance to poison damage.  
- Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points it restores.  
- You stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn.  
- You reduce your [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level by two whenever you finish a long rest, instead of one.  

If your attunement to the heart ends, it magically appears in your open hand or in the nearest unoccupied space.
