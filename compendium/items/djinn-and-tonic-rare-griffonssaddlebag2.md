# Djinn and Tonic (Rare)
*Potion, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Djinn-and-Tonic.webp#right)  


The following [djinn and tonic](compendium/items/djinn-and-tonic-griffonssaddlebag2.md) is a rare variant with additional properties. It also tastes better. When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [gaseous form](compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md) spell for 10 minutes (no concentration required) or until you end it early using an action. When the effect ends, your form rematerializes in a rush of air, forcing all Large and smaller creatures within 30 feet of you to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
