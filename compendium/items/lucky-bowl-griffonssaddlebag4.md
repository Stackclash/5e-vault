# Lucky Bowl
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Lucky-Bowl.webp#right)  


This bowl is embossed with various laughing monks. A ring is attached to its lip for easy carrying on a belt. When you make an ability check to use the bowl to beg or busk, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll. A creature that drops one or more coins in the bowl magically hears a soft and bell-like laugh from it.

When you finish a short or long rest while holding the bowl, you can make a DC 13 Intelligence ([Religion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check. On a successful check, the bowl is magically filled with a meal's worth of warm and fluffy rice, and this property of the bowl can't be used again until the next dawn.

Alternatively, if you place an object inside the bowl and use an action to offer it as a gift to another humanoid, that humanoid must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for 1 hour. The save DC increases to 14 if the given object was worth 1-10 gp, and 15 if it was worth more than 10 gp. The effect ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to it. For the duration, the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the effect ends, the creature knows it was [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you. Once this property of the bowl has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
