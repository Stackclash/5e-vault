# Verax Weapon
*Major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Verax-Weapon.webp#right)  


A verax weapon has been made by quenching its metal in the blood of a particular creature while being forged, enchanting the weapon with a magic that hunts down creatures of the chosen type. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Use the table below to choose or randomly determine what creature type's blood was used to enchant the weapon. When you use this weapon to attack a creature of the chosen type and are forced to make the attack roll with disadvantage, you make the attack roll as normal instead.
