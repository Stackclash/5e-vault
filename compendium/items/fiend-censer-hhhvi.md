# Fiend Censer
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This censer takes the shape of an imp's head with a groove in the crown of its skull for a candle to be placed in. When a lit candle is placed in the groove, the head becomes animate and begins to magically detect fiends around it in the same manner as if through the spell [detect evil and good](compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md). If the head detects a fiend within 30 feet of it, it will begin to loudly scream the presence of this fiend as well as where it is located. This head will continue to be active until the candle on its head is either extinguished or removed.

If a fiend is aware of the fiend censer when they enter its detection range for the first time, they may make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to avoid detection by the censer.
