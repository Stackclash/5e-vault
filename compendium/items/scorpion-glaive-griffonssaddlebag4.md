# Scorpion Glaive
*Weapon ([glaive](compendium/items/glaive.md)), uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Scorpion-Glaive.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This glaive is gently curved. It magically straightens when you thrust it forward. On a hit, the weapon deals either piercing or slashing damage (your choice each time). When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns; it can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on a success.
