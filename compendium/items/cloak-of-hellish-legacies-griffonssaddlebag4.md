# Cloak of Hellish Legacies
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a tiefling)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Cloak-of-Hellish-Legacies.webp#right)  


This dark leather cloak is inscribed with Infernal script along its hems. Its hood has a pair of holes for your horns to fit through. While wearing the cloak, the range of your [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) increases by 30 feet, and you can see normally in magical darkness (as if it were nonmagical) out to a range of 30 feet. If the cloak's hood is up, your face becomes hidden in pitch-dark shadow. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

The cloak's hue changes to match an associated layer of hell. The color is subtle, and is best seen faintly reflected in its shadows, as if staring into an oil-slicked pool. The first time you attune to the cloak, and then again daily at dawn, you can choose which layer of hell for the cloak to associate with. Use the table below to determine the color and damage type associated with the chosen layer.

| Layer | Color | Damage type |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Coruscating | Orange | Lightning |
| Corrosive | Green | Acid |
| Frozen | Blue | Cold |
| Rotting | Gray | Necrotic |
| Sickly | Purple | Poison |

While wearing the cloak, you gain resistance to the damage type associated with its current layer. Furthermore, if you cast a damage-dealing spell using your hellish Legacy racial trait, you can choose to change its damage type to the one associated with the cloak's current layer.

The cloak has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to change the cloak's associated layer. Alternatively, you can expend 1 or more of its charges when you cast a spell using your hellish Legacy racial trait; the spell's level increases by 1 for each expended charge.

Whenever you change the cloak's color, you can also choose to change the color of your skin to match the chosen layer. This change lasts until you change the cloak's color again, until you're no longer wearing the cloak, or until you end it early (no action required), at which point you return to your normal color.
