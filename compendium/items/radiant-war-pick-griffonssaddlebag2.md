# Radiant War Pick
*Weapon ([war pick](compendium/items/war-pick.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Radiant-War-Pick.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This silver and golden weapon is wrapped in fragments of holy vestments and glimmers spectacularly in sun and moonlight. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this war pick, the target takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage. If the target is a shapechanger or undead, this radiant damage is maximized.

In addition, while holding the war pick, you can use an action to expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast the [moonbeam](compendium/spells/moonbeam.md) (6th-level version) or [sunbeam](compendium/spells/sunbeam.md) spell from it (save DC 16). Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

You can use an action to speak the war pick's command word to cause it to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Speaking the command word again puts out the light.
