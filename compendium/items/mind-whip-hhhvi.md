# Mind Whip
*Weapon ([whip](compendium/items/whip.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

When you make a [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) check, you may choose to do so with this whip instead of using your free hand. If you do so and if you succeed on the [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) check, you may force the [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) creature to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, this whip may not be used to attack another target. Once this ability has been used 4 times in a day, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
