# Nightstalker's Kanabo
*Weapon ([greatclub](compendium/items/greatclub.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Nightstalkers-Kanabo.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This studded greatclub once belonged to a hungering [oni](compendium/bestiary/giant/oni.md) who excelled at subterfuge. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the heavy property. When you hit a sleeping creature with this weapon, that creature takes an extra `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) psychic damage from the attack. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, the target of the attack must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or magically fall asleep until the end of your next turn, the sleeper takes damage, or a creature uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. While the target is asleep, it is [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). Undead and creatures immune to being [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) automatically succeed on the saving throw.

The weapon has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges as a bonus action to cast either the [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) (targeting only yourself ) or [sleep](compendium/spells/sleep.md) (3rd-level version) spell from it.
