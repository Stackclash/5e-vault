# Sea Soap
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

This ubiquitous plant can be found in great clumps of small white flowers dotting a beachside. Adapted to windy, saline environments, the flowers secrete a waxy substance that it uses to protect itself from desiccating winds. Sailors and fishermen have long used these flowers and their wax as a means of protecting themselves from the elements by rubbing it all over their skin. In fact, the wax is so potent that it even provides a meaningful buffer should one ever come under assault by a wave of caustic acid.

## Effect:

You gain resistance to acid damage for 4 hours after using this herb.
