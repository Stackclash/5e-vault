# Magebane Mask
*Wondrous item, major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Magebane-Mask.webp#right)  


This dark iron mask was used in the mage realm during the Upheaval, when arcanists were persecuted for their gifts. While holding the mask, you can use an action to place it on the head of a humanoid (or similarly shaped) creature, whereupon it magically resizes and clasps down. If the creature is unwilling, you must make a Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check contested by the target's Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, the mask is successfully placed on the creature's head. The mask can only be removed by a creature that uses an action to speak its command word or to make a successful DC 30 Strength check. A creature that removes the mask by force with a successful Strength check also destroys the mask.

The mask prevents a creature wearing it from casting most spells and being affected by most beneficial magic. A creature wearing the mask can't speak or cast any spell of 5th level or lower. It also can't speak or be spoken to telepathically, nor can it benefit from any magical effects. While wearing the mask, a creature doesn't need to eat or drink.
