# Warp Anchor
*Rod, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Warp-Anchor.webp#right)  


This pair of batons magically link together to form a complete rod, causing a purple mist to swirl between the two glass orbs on either of its ends. While holding the rod or its batons, you can use an action to speak the rod's first command word to split it into the batons or recombine them again.

While holding one of the split batons, you can use an action to speak the rod's second command word to cast the [teleport](compendium/spells/teleport.md) spell from it, teleporting only yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the other baton, even if it's on another plane of existence. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the batons have spent at least 12 hours recombined as the rod, at which point the swirling mist reappears within the orbs.
