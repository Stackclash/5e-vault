# Wizard's Friend
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A delightfully eye-catching tulip with a violet hue, this flower can be crushed into a beautiful, memorable ink. Because of its high quality, many wizards enjoy inscribing their spellbooks with this ink and it is common in many cultures to gift a bouquet of these flowers to young mages upon the completion of their studies.

## Effect:

Over the course of an hour, this herb may be crushed and mixed in order to create a deep purple ink that can be used to inscribe spells into a wizard's spellbook. When used in this way, the ink replaces the gold piece requirements of the inscription. One herb is capable of creating enough ink to replace up to 100 gold pieces worth of spell inscription components.
