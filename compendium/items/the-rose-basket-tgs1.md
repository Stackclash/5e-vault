# The Rose Basket
*Weapon ([rapier](compendium/items/rapier.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/The-Rose-Basket.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This silver rapier has a rose adorning its crossguard and pommel and has thorns lining its hilt. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage to any shapechanger or fey creature it hits.

## Field of Roses

As an action, you can speak the rapier's command word and touch its point to the ground at your feet. When you do, silver rosebushes sprout from the ground in a 25-foot square, centered on your location. The area becomes difficult terrain, and when a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. While holding this rapier, you can pass through this area as if it were normal terrain, and you don't take damage from moving within it. The rosebushes remain for 1 minute or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
