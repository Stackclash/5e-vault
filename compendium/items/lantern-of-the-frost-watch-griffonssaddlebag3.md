# Lantern of the Frost Watch
*Wondrous item, major, rare*

This dark steel lantern is always cold to the touch, and its cold blue flame releases fine snow instead of smoke. Its magical flame appears over a spike at the lantern's center, which is perpetually covered in ice. While touching the lantern, you can use an action to speak one of the following five command words.

## Aduro

The lantern's flame is ignited or extinguished. The lit lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

## Calidum

The lantern's flame glows orange for up to 10 minutes. For the duration, each creature within the lantern's bright light has resistance to cold damage. Once this command word has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Micare

The lantern's flame glows impossibly bright. Each creature that isn't shielding its eyes within the lantern's bright light must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can shield your eyes as part of the action to use this property. Once this command word has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Revelare

The lantern's flame glows green for up to 10 minutes. Magical objects and effects within the lantern's bright light are outlined with a faint green glow for the duration. Magical darkness and fog within this range is suppressed for the duration. Once this command word has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Vide

The lantern's flame glows magenta for up to 10 minutes. Invisible creatures and creatures on the Ethereal Plane become visible within the lantern's bright light for the duration. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent. Once this command word has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

If you speak one of the lantern's command words in this way while its flame is extinguished, it magically lights itself as part of speaking the command word. If you extinguish the lantern's flame while one or more of its effects are active, those effects immediately end.
