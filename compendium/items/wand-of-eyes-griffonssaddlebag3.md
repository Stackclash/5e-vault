# Wand of Eyes
*Wand, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wand-of-Eyes.webp#right)  


This wand's glistening white haft has eye-like veins tracing down its length. The wand has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [clairvoyance](compendium/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell from it. This version of the spell remains for 1 minute, and can only be used to see through the sensor. The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the wand.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or [truesight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Truesight)) sees a floating, ghostly eyeball.
