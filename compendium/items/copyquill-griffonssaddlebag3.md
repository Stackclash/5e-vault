# Copyquill
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Copyquill.webp#right)  


This quill is made from a single feather that splits into two towards the top. While writing with the quill on a piece of parchment, it magically makes an identical copy on a second paired one, provided that the two are within 30 feet of each other. You can pair up to two pieces of parchment to the quill by tapping one of its feathered ends to either piece and speaking the quill's command word one at a time, using an action for each piece of parchment. Speaking the command word without touching the quill to parchment ends the paired connection.

The quill requires twice as much ink as normal when making a copy in this way.
