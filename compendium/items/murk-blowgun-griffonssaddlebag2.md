A hefty blowgun used by the inhabitants of the Murk: a series of deadly swamps whose waters are polluted with an uncanny poison. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic blowgun, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) poison damage. When you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with the blowgun, the target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the end of its next turn. It is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) while poisoned in this way.

In addition, this blowgun can be wielded as a magic [club](compendium/items/club.md)
