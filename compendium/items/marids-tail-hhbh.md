# Marid's Tail
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

This conical plant is often mistaken for coral due to the ridged, blue shell that it develops on its exterior, as well as the fact that it is found adhered to rocks and other hard surfaces. Inside the shell is actually a highly developed plant vascular system that regulates and cleanses sea water, using the minerals to form its hard shell. However, should this shell ever be broken, the pressurised interior of the plant becomes highly unstable and explodes, violently forcing the stored water to gush in a tremendous burst. It's believed that this is actually by design as wellâ€”as the movement allows the plant to spread and propagate itself once it reaches maturity.

## Effect:

You may make weapon attacks with this herb, treating it as if it was a [dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md). On a successful hit, the herb lodges itself in the target and then bursts, forcing the target to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 20 feet as a strong blast of water gushes out from the ruptured herb. Once this herb has been used once in this way, it is destroyed and becomes useless.
