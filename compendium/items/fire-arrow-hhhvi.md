# Fire Arrow
*Ammunition ([arrow](compendium/items/arrow.md)), uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 F
- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)
- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

These arrows combust upon direct piercing organic material. When you hit a target successfully with this arrow, you deal an additional `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage. These arrows lose this property on hit and become regular arrows afterwards.
