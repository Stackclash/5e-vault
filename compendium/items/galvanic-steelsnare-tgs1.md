# Galvanic Steelsnare
*Weapon ([net](compendium/items/net.md)), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Galvanic-Steelsnare.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown), [special](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Special%20Weapons)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This magic net is made with fine steel chains and has the heavy property. Magic, leaden weights line the edge of the net and send shocking pulses throughout the metal. The net is resistant to slashing damage and has immunity to all other damage types. Regardless of a creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn while it's restrained by the net.

## Special

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
