# Fey's Fear
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

There are legends of a certain type of tree that all fey creatures fearâ€”one cursed in the dying breath of a forsaken kin who wanted to inflict their last moments of spite on all the mercurial denizens of the Feywild. Regardless of the veracity of this legend, it is true that most fey creatures find the branches of the *incarcereta* tree particularly repugnant, as it has the remarkable ability to 'lock' a creature within space and cut them off from any magic that would attempt to shunt their body elsewhere. It is only natural that the fey, who consider teleportation their default mode of transport and who treat the barrier between planes as a formality at best, fear and despise this otherwise useful herb.

## Effect:

You may use this herb as a weapon, treating it as a [dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md). When you successfully hit a creature with this herb, you may choose to leave it embedded in their body, losing the herb in the process. A creature with this herb embedded in its body cannot teleport or enter a different plane of reality. That creature, or a creature adjacent to it, may use its action to remove the herb from their body, breaking it in the process and making it useless.
