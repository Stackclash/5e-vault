This impenetrable armor is made from refined fragments of a tarrasque's armored hide and retains some of its original properties. You have resistance to damage from spells and a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you're targeted by a [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 6, you are unaffected by the spell, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from you, turning the caster into the target.
