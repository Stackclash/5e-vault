A sickly, yellow eye stares unblinkingly from the winged blade of this magic halberd. You can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength, for attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While you aren't missing any hit points, you can use an action to cast the [eldritch blast](compendium/spells/eldritch-blast.md) cantrip from the weapon, using a spell attack bonus of +5. If you're a warlock and holding this weapon, you can always cast the spell from the weapon as if you were casting it. This version of eldritch blast fires beams of purple energy, which look like magical bats streaking through the air.

When you use this weapon to either make an attack or cast [eldritch blast](compendium/spells/eldritch-blast.md) and roll a 10 on a damage die, the attack deals extra psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 0). You can deal this extra damage once per turn.

## Curse

This halberd is cursed, and if you aren't a warlock, becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the halberd, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. While you remain cursed, you can feel the watchful eye of the halberd listening to your thoughts: whenever you take psychic damage, roll a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) and add the result to the total psychic damage taken.
