# Coralshield Golem
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Coralshield-Golem.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This crablike golem is made of a light but resilient magical coral. While wearing it on your back, you can use a bonus action to command it to move along your arm and don itself. You can command the golem to return to your back using another bonus action.

If you don't have a free hand or refuse to drop what you're holding when the golem attempts to don itself, it returns and reattaches to your back.
