# Embergrass
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A short, saffron coloured grass that resembles smouldering embers when viewed from afar. It only grows in extreme heat, which includes areas that have been recently touched by a wildfire. Due to its heat resistant properties, embergrass is used as a basic flame retardant and survivalists have been known to cover themselves in it should they ever find themselves caught in the path of a blazing fire.

## Effect:

For 1 hour after you apply this herb, you have resistance to fire damage and you automatically succeed any skill check or saving throw made to resist the effects of hot weather.
