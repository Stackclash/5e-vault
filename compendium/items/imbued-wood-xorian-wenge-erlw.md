# Imbued Wood (Xorian Wenge)
*Generic Variant, common (requires attunement)*  


An imbued wood focus is a rod, staff, or wand cut from a tree infused with extraplanar energy. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this item as a spellcasting focus.

When you cast a damage-dealing spell using this item as your spellcasting focus, you gain a +1 bonus to one psychic damage roll of the spell.
