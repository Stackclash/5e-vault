# Bowstring Amulet
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Bowstring-Amulet.webp#right)  


This amulet's bow and arrow pendant is strung with a length of well-worn bowstring. Once on each of your turns while wearing the amulet, you can speak its command word as part of making a ranged attack with a bow or crossbow. When you do, the fired arrow or bolt magically creates a length of weightless hempen rope behind it. One end of the rope is tied to the arrow or bolt, and the other end appears in an open hand or at your feet (your choice). The rope remains for 10 minutes, until it's cut or untied, or until you use this property of the amulet again, at which point the rope instantly unravels and disappears. The rope also disappears early if it becomes longer than 300 feet before the arrow or bolt hits a target. For the rope's duration, the arrow or bolt can hold up to 500 pounds without breaking or dislodging from its point of impact.
