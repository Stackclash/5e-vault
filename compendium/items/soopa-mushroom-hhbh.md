# Soopa Mushroom
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A red and white mushroom with small black spots on its stem that are often mistaken for eyes. Named for its discoverer, Soopa Mah'reyo, this mushroom has the curious feature of possessing a magical gas that inflates one's body size upon consumption. Unfortunately, it does nothing to raise one's other physical attributes, and the gas will escape from one's body as soon as any sort of physical trauma occurs, returning the eater to their normal size. Still, it has been described as an overall novel experience, and is often enjoyed by children in playtime and pranks.

## Effect:

As an action, you may eat this herb, causing you to grow one size larger than you normally are; if there is not enough space to accommodate your new size, you revert back to your normal size and this herb is wasted. The effects of this herb lasts for 4 hours, or until you take damage, whichever comes first.
