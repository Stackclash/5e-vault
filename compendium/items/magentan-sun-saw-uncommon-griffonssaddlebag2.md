# Magentan Sun-Saw (Uncommon)
*Weapon ([scimitar](compendium/items/scimitar.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Magentan-Sun-Saw.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The typical [magentan sun-saw](compendium/items/magentan-sun-saw-griffonssaddlebag2.md), an uncommon item, is a falchion with a curved metal guard that protects your hand. The sword has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a target with this magic sword, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack to reach your fingers around the weapon's curved guard and pull it like a trigger. When you do, a line of whirring blades of light springs from the weapon's edge and rips around the length of the sword, rending and tearing into the target to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) radiant damage to it. The light is a vibrant magenta.
