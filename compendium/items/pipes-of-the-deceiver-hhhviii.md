# Pipes of the Deceiver
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This pipe has 10 charges. If you are proficient in a wind instrument, you may expend charges and use your action to play this pipe and use one of the following abilities of your choice:

## Spellcasting

You use the pipe to cast one of the following spells of your choice: [alter self](compendium/spells/alter-self.md) (2 charges), [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead.md) (3 charges), [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md) (3 charges), [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md) (4 chargeS), [major image](compendium/spells/major-image.md) (3 charges), [modify memory](compendium/spells/modify-memory.md) (5 charges), [mislead](compendium/spells/mislead.md) (5 charges), [nondetection](compendium/spells/nondetection.md) (3 charges), or [sending](compendium/spells/sending.md) (3 charges).

## Frightful Word

You expend 2 charges and target one creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. While [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, the target must take the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Twisting Words

You expend 3 charges and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or become [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for 1 minute. The [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target can repeat the saving throw if you deal any damage to it. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If you use this ability on a creature already [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you in this way, that creature must make the saving throw again. On a failure, you decide how that target acts on its next turn.

This pipe regains all expended charges at dawn.
