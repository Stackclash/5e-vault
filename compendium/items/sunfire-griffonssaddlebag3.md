# Sunfire
*Weapon ([hand crossbow](compendium/items/hand-crossbow.md)), major, rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Sunfire.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d8 R
- **Range**: 100/400
- **Properties**: [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This gilded device has an orb at its base with a pair of sunburst pendants. Each pendant is affixed to either side of the orb, which generates a carefully managed and concentrated source of magical sunlight within the orb. From there, the sunlight is channeled through a prismatic barrel into a narrow beam using a series of crystal lenses.

This item is a unique, one-handed ranged weapon, which can be used even if you aren't attuned to it. If you are proficient with hand crossbows or are attuned to the weapon, you are proficient with the sunfire.

The weapon has the light property, and it has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 400 feet. On a hit, a target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage, or `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) radiant damage if you are attuned to it. You don't add your Dexterity modifier to the damage of this attack (unless it's negative), but can add your spellcasting ability modifier if you're attuned to the weapon. If the target has the Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity trait, such as a drow or vampire, it's considered to be in sunlight until the end of its next turn.

If you're not attuned to the weapon and roll a 1 on the attack roll using the weapon, one of the attached sunburst pendants crumbles to dust and is destroyed. For each missing pendant, the weapon's radiant damage is reduced by one damage die. You can use an action to replace a pendant with a new one, which must be worth at least 100 gp.
