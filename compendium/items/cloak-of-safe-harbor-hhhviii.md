# Cloak of Safe Harbor
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this cloak, you may use your action to pull the hood up over your head, transporting yourself and everything you are wearing and carrying to a pocket dimension that resembles a blank void with a breathable atmosphere. You may stay in this pocket dimension for up to 1 hour per day, which you may do so all at once, or in several shorter increments. If your time runs out or if you take the hood off (no action required) you return to your original plane in the space which you disappeared from, or the nearest unoccupied space if that is impossible.

If you receive damage while wearing this cloak, you may use your reaction to pull the hood up, transporting you to your pocket dimension and negating the damage you just took. You automatically return to your original space or nearest unoccupied space at the start of your next turn. The time spent in your pocket dimension in this way does not count towards the overall time spent in your pocket dimension for the day and this ability can be used even if you have already been in your pocket dimension for 1 hour this day. However, once you have used the cloak in this way, it may not be used again like this until you finish a short or long rest.
