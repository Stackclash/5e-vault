# Alchemist's Potion Belt
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Alchemists-Potion-Belt.webp#right)  


This enchanted belt has two stoppers that magically resize to fit the mouth of any kind of bottle. The belt can carry up to two potions in this way. The belt can be worn comfortably around your waist or across your chest as a bandolier. While wearing the belt, any potion carried on it seems to magically unstopper and spring to your hand, allowing you to drink it as a bonus action. You can attach a bottle to the belt using an action.

When you roll a 1 on a Dexterity saving throw or are hit by a critical hit, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, one of the bottles on the belt shatters and is destroyed.
