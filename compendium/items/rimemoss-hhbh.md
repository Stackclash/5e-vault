# Rimemoss
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

A pure white variety of moss unique in that it only grows in frigid temperatures. Found in thick, white, fuzzy sheets on trunks and branches, the moss has a symbiotic relationship with the trees that it grows upon. In exchange for sapping some of the trees vitality and nutrients, the rimemoss provides crucial protection that can keep more fragile trees safe during the winter months. Arctic tribes have long harvested this moss for its insulation properties, even developing techniques to keep it thriving during the warmer seasons.

## Effect:

You may spend 10 minutes lining your clothes with rimemoss. If you do so, you automatically succeed on any Constitution saving throw to resist the negative effects of cold environments and weather.
