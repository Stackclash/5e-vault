![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Death-Knell.webp#right)

This dark metal weapon is grimly ornate. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Once per turn when you reduce a Small or larger creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, a foreboding, gong-like sound emanates from the blade. When this happens, any hostile creature within 15 feet of the target that's missing any of its hit points must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.
