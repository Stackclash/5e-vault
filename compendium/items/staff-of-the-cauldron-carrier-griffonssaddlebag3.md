![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Staff-of-the-Cauldron-Carrier.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This iron and brass staff holds a cauldron at its end. Despite its materials, it only weighs as much as a normal staff. While you're attuned to it, you gain a +1 bonus to any ability check using alchemy supplies, [cook's utensils](compendium/items/cooks-utensils.md), or an [herbalism kit](compendium/items/herbalism-kit.md).

## Spells

The staff has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [burning hands](compendium/spells/burning-hands.md) (1 charge), [create food and water](compendium/spells/create-food-and-water.md) (3 charges), [detect poison and disease](compendium/spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md) (1 charge), [heat metal](compendium/spells/heat-metal.md) (2 charges), or [purify food and drink](compendium/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md) (1 charge). This version of the [create food and water](compendium/spells/create-food-and-water.md) spell grants `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) temporary hit points to any creature that consumes a meal that it creates. The food created by the spell is delicious.
