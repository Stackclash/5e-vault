# Set of Numat's Trick Tubes
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Set-of-Numats-Trick-Tubes.webp#right)  


This drab pair of empty ceramic cylinders are magically linked. Each vessel is 3 inches in diameter and 1 foot tall. Placing an item inside one of the vessels and closing the lid will magically teleport it to the second tube, making a quiet whoosh sound when it does. A similarly quiet thud can be heard when receiving an item. A tube can't send more than 2 pounds of material at a time and can't be used to send a creature. Both vessels must be on the same plane of existence and have their lids closed in order for an item to be teleported between them.
