# Helm of the Illithid
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this helmet, you have telepathy out to a range of 120 feet. In addition, you may spend an action to magically emit psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) psychic damage and be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
