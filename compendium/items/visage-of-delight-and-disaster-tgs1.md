# Visage of Delight and Disaster
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement by a creature with a Charisma score of 17 or higher)*

While wearing this mask, you gain 2 [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) dice, which are `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`)s. These dice are separate from any Bardic Inspiration dice you have from another source. You can use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die. These dice are the same as normal Bardic Inspiration dice, but carry with them additional benefits based on the mood of your performance:

## Delight

If you inspire a creature with a joyful or uplifting performance, that creature has advantage on saving throws to resist becoming [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) for 1 minute following your performance. In addition, when that creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, it gains temporary hit points equal to twice the amount it rolled on the die.

## Disaster

If you inspire a creature with a grim or haunting performance, that creature has advantage on saving throws to resist becoming [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) for 1 minute following your performance. In addition, when that creature hits a target with a weapon attack, it can expend the Bardic Inspiration die to deal psychic damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. This psychic damage is equal to twice the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.

The expression of the mask subtly changes to reflect your expression or mouth's movement behind the mask. You regain all expended Bardic Inspiration dice when you finish a short or long rest.
