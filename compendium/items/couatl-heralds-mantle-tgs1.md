# Couatl Herald's Mantle
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Couatl-Heralds-Mantle.webp#right)  


This magic cloak is given to those deemed kind-hearted and responsible by a celestial. While wearing the mantle, you have advantage on saving throws to resist becoming [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) or diseased. In addition, you are immune to any effect that would sense your emotions.

## Flight of the Couatls

While you're attuned to 3 items with this property, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, your flying speed increases by 30 feet instead.
