# Infernal Aegis
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Infernal-Aegis.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to become wreathed in harmless, magical flames. The flames cast bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. The flames last until you speak its command word again as a bonus action or until you drop or doff the shield.

While holding the shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC as well as resistance to fire damage. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, the shield has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While the shield is ablaze, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [fire shield](compendium/spells/fire-shield.md) (2 charges, warm shield only) or [hellish rebuke](compendium/spells/hellish-rebuke.md) (1 charge, save DC 16) spell from it.
