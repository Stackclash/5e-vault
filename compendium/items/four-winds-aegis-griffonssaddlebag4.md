# Four Winds Aegis
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Four-Winds-Aegos.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This spiraling metal shield is remarkably light. While holding it, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

In addition, you can throw the shield as if it were a weapon. When you do, it's treated as a +1 light hammer for the duration of the attack. The shield returns to your hand immediately after the attack, spinning through the air as if it were buoyed by wind. You can doff and don the shield again as part of any attack you make with it in this way.

## Gale Force Winds

You can use an action to speak the shield's command word while holding it to cause a powerful tornado to erupt from the shield. The tornado appears in a vertical or horizontal cylinder that's centered on the shield (your choice). The cylinder is 40 feet tall and extends 15 feet from you if it's vertical, or in a line extending from you that's 40 feet long and 15 feet wide if it's horizontal. Each creature within the area of the tornado must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 15 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
