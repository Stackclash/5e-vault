# Battlebrew Maul
*Weapon ([maul](compendium/items/maul.md)), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Battlebrew-Maul.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 B
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

The head of this maul is an alchemical keg that generates battlebrew liquor, a favorite among dwarves and half-orcs. The keg holds up to 4 gallons of the liquor and creates 1 gallon each day at dawn and again each time you roll for initiative while holding it. A creature can use its action to remove or reattach the handle of the maul to the keg, and another action to pour out or stopper it.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While held in combat, the hammer heats the liquor inside it. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) acid damage as the hammer buckles from the impact and releases a spray of the volatile liquor.

For 1 minute after a target has been sprayed with acid in this way, the next time that target takes fire damage, it takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage as the liquor ignites.
