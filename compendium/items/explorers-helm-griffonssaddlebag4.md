# Explorer's Helm
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Explorers-Helm.webp#right)  


While wearing this helmet, you're considered proficient with [cartographer's tools](compendium/items/cartographers-tools.md). You also have advantage on Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks, and you always know which way is north if you're outside. In addition, if you've been traveling at a consistent pace for at least 1 hour, nonmagical difficult terrain doesn't slow your travel while you continue at that pace.
