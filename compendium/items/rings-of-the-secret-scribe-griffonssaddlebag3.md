# Rings of the Secret Scribe
*Ring, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Rings-of-the-Secret-Scribe.webp#right)  


This pair of rings only function when worn on adjacent fingers: typically on a thumb and forefinger. While pinching the two fingers together, such as when pantomiming writing with a quill, you can magically write on any surface within one inch of your fingers. The writing itself appears in nonmagical ink in a color of your choice.
