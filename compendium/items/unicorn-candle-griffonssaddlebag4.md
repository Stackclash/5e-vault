# Unicorn Candle
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Unicorn-Candle.webp#right)  


This golden candle is set in a porcelain and gold-leaf holder, which is shaped like a horse's head. The candle sheds candlelight. Undead within the candle's bright light make attack rolls with disadvantage. Other creatures within the bright light are under the effects of the beacon of hope spell. Whenever a creature regains the maximum number of hit points from healing because of the candle, deduct a number of minutes from the candle's total burn time equal to the hit points restored (maximum 10 minutes).

Once the candle is destroyed, you can replace it with a normal candle in the empty porcelain holder. The candle becomes a unicorn candle if it's blessed by a unicorn that touches it with its horn.
