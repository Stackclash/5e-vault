This light hammer was forged using the remains of a comet and is cold to the touch. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and when you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) cold damage. The hammer leaves behind a crackling mist when thrown and immediately flies back to your hand after making a ranged attack with it.
