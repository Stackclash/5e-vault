# Ring of Salt
*Ring, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Ring-of-Salt.webp#right)  


This clear ring is made of crystalline salt. Donning or removing the ring requires an action. While wearing this ring, ghosts can neither move through nor possess you. If a ghost is already in your space or possessing you when you put on the ring of salt, it's forcibly ejected from you to the nearest unoccupied space and takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage. Furthermore, the first time on each of your turns when you move through a ghost's space, that ghost must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed to the nearest unoccupied space and take `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage. Each time a ghost is forcibly ejected or pushed by the ring, the ring has a 10 percent chance of being destroyed and crumbling into a negligible pile of salt.
