*Weapon ([dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Frozen-Dagger.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 C
- **Range**: 40/80
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)

Attacks made with this dagger deal cold damage instead of piercing. If you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) until the end of its next turn, frozen in place and unable to move. If it succeeds, its movement speed is halved until the end of its next turn instead.
