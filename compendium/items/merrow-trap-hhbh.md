# Merrow Trap
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

An extremely common type of seagrass found all over the ocean, this plant unfortunately has very strong ties to the predatory [merrow](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow.md) that utilise its long stalks as both an ambush point and as a disorienting environment to trap their prey. The [merrow](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow.md) have also been known to use the grass as fletching on their weapons, using the grass' natural hydrodynamics to make their projectiles more effective underwater.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice:1d20|noform|avg` (``) charges, with each charge corresponding to a blade of seagrass. You may expend 1 charge and spend 1 minute attaching a blade of seagrass to a [bolt](compendium/items/crossbow-bolt.md) or [arrow](compendium/items/arrow.md). If you do so, that bolt or arrow suffers no penalties associated with being used underwater.
