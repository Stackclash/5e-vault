# Volt Gauntlets
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Volt-Gauntlets.webp#right)  


These metallic gauntlets have several sharp points extending from its knuckles and are lined with an insulating material. Unarmed strikes made with your fists while wearing these gauntlets deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning. In addition, the gauntlets have 6 charges and regain `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike with the gauntlets, you can expend 1 of their charges to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) lightning damage. When you do, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. While the gauntlets hold at least 1 charge, they give off occasional snaps and sparks of electricity.
