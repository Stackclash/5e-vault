# Radiant Oil
*Oil, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

You may spend 1 minute applying this oil to an item no larger than 1 cubic foot in volume. For the next hour, the oiled item shines bright light out to a range of 15 feet and then dim light for 15 feet beyond that, and any damage dealt using that item may be treated as radiant damage instead of its usual damage type.

Alternatively, you may smash this bottle of oil on a hard surface up to 20 feet away from you. If you do so, the oil violently reacts and creates a blinding flash of light, affecting any creature in a 10-foot radius of it. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage and, if the creature can see the light, is [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage and isn't [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded).
