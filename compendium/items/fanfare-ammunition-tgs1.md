# Fanfare Ammunition
*Minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Fanfare-Ammunition.webp#right)  


A favorite among tricksters, this ammunition is intended to distract rather than wound. When you make a ranged attack with this ammunition and hit a target, the attack deals no damage, and the ammunition vanishes and is destroyed on impact. In its place, a noise of your choice erupts from the point of impact, such as the sound of books falling, a dropped coin, or the breaking of glass. You decide the noise and its volume when you fire the ammunition. The sound can be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream. A creature can determine that the sound is an illusion with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.
