# Dryad's Secret
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A deep brown nut roughly the size of a fist, they are found buried underneath the roots of old, healthy trees, but can be noticed by the heart-shaped pattern of clovers that they shoot through the soil. When ground up, the nut produces a fragrant oil that when applied like a perfume, causes anyone that smells the wearer to become more amenable. Their connection to dryads is widely agreed, but their exact relationship is disputed: some believe that the nut is the source of their infamous charms and that digging them up is like plundering their personal stash, while others maintain they leave them behind as a gift to encourage relationships between those that find them.

## Effect:

After using this herb, you produce a pleasant smell for the next 4 hours that causes those around you to become open to suggestion. During this time, you have advantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) made to convince humanoids to trust or befriend you.
