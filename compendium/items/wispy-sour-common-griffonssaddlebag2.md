# Wispy Sour (Common)
*Potion, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wispy-Sour.webp#right)  


The typical [wispy sour](compendium/items/wispy-sour-griffonssaddlebag2.md), a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes you to float harmlessly off the floor. When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet for 1 minute, but can only hover 1 foot above the ground when doing so. The drink is smooth, sweet, and has a slight aftertaste of ash. A tiny, single light from the dancing lights spell is often cast within the drink when served. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
