# Everwort Root
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A golden-hued root that grows twisted into the sideways-eight shape commonly associated with infinity. It is currently unknown how these roots reproduce since they produce no seeds or pollen, and propagating cuttings of it yields little results. Due to this, the supply of the root is incredibly low, especially given its high demand in an adventurer's inventory. Despite growing only in arid areas, the root is constantly filled with an amber liquid that when added to a potion, greatly increases its efficacy.

## Effect:

As an action, you may pour the liquid inside this root into a potion. Any duration associated with that potion's effect is doubled permanently.
