# Living Chalk
*Wondrous Item, common, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

Images drawn by this chalk are capable of small amounts of movement on their drawing surface, resembling a basic flipbook animation. These images tend to act in a manner imagined by the creature that drew them but are otherwise unaware of their surroundings and cannot move more than 1 foot beyond their original placement. These drawings lose their enchantment and freeze into place 10 minutes after being drawn.
