# Moonfallen Maul
*Weapon ([maul](compendium/items/maul.md)), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Moonfallen-Maul.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 B
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This maul's stone head is carved from fallen moon rock. A howling wolf and pockmarked moon are carved into the weapon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, or a +2 bonus if it's between dusk and dawn. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target of the attack must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you until the end of your next turn. The target has disadvantage on the saving throw if it can see the moon or if it's cursed with lycanthropy. A [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature immediately falls [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) as it recoils.
