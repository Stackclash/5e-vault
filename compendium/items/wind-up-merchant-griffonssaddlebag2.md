# Wind-Up Merchant
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wind-Up-Merchant.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This soft toy figurine is 5 inches tall and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to wind up the toy using a crank in the back, causing it to release a thin strip of parchment listing 3 magic items and their costs from the list below. The toy then whirs and animates slowly, walking and bowing slightly, and can't be wound up again until 24 hours have passed.

Roll `dice:3d12|noform|avg` (`3d12`), recording each number rolled, to determine which of the following magic items are listed on the parchment. At the GM's discretion, reroll duplicate results.

`dice: [](wind-up-merchant-griffonssaddlebag2.md#^item-name)`

^item-name

While the toy is animated, you can use an action to deposit any number of coins into the slot on the toy's belly and speak the name of an item listed on the parchment. If the value of the coins deposited in the toy is equal to or greater than the cost of the named item, the item magically appears in your hand or at your feet (your choice) and is removed from the parchment. The spent coins are then lost.

The toy remains animated for 5 minutes or until each item has been purchased from the list. When the toy stops animating, any deposited coins that weren't spent on the listed items clatter to the ground below it, converting them into smaller denominations as needed, and the parchment turns to dust and is destroyed.

An item purchased from the wind-up merchant disappears after 24 hours, or early if you attempt to sell or trade it to another creature.
