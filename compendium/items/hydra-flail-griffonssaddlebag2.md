# Hydra Flail
*Weapon ([flail](compendium/items/flail.md)), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Hydra-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This flail's spiked head is held in the jaws of a metal hydra figurehead. Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon against a hostile creature, the weapon magically grows another spiked head. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls made with this magic weapon for each head the flail has (to a maximum of +6). After 1 hour, any head the flail grows in this way falls off and disappears.
