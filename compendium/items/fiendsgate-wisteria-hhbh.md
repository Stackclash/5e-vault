# Fiendsgate Wisteria
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

A particularly stunning variety of wisteria with a distinctive yellow streak on their petals that pulsates faintly with a calming glow. It is believed that these wisteria only grow in areas that were once the site of some holy event, such as a religious ritual or the death of a blessed figure. Either way, the presence of this wisteria is known to deter fiends, with only the strongest-willed among them able to cross over a line of its petals.

## Effect:

As part of your movement, you may scatter wisteria petals at your feet as you walk. A bag of these petals can make a line of up to 30 feet in length. If a creature with the fiend creature type attempts to crossover a line of petals, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, their speed is reduced to 0 for the rest of their turn.
