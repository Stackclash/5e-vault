# Shield of the Great Badger
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Shield-of-the-Great-Badger.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This dark silver shield is stylized in the striped likeness of a badger's face. While holding this shield, you can't be moved more than 5 feet against your will at a time.

The shield has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield's charges to cause a spectral badger to emerge from the shield and lash back out at the attacker. The attacking creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d4+3|noform|avg` (`2d4 + 3`) slashing damage.
