# Rune-Marked Bracers
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Rune-Marked-Bracers.webp#right)  


These bracers were made by giant stone carvers and enchanters. Five elemental runes are carved into the sides of this pair of stone bracers, which magically loosen or tighten around your forearms to fit. Each bracer weighs 10 pounds, but they miraculously become weightless once you attune to them. While wearing the bracers, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

If you're wearing the bracers, you can use your reaction when a creature hits you with a melee attack to activate one of the runes on the bracers. Once a rune has been activated, that rune can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Cloud

The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away from you.

## Fire

The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage. The creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, taking another `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on a successful one. Alternatively, a creature within reach of the original attacker can use an action to extinguish the flames and end the effect.

## Frost

The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) cold damage and have its speed halved until the end of your next turn.

## Stone

The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become sluggish and stone-like, causing the creature to be [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the end of your next turn.

## Storm

The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) lightning damage and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.
