# Crown of the Cursed King
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Crown-of-the-Cursed-King.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

This tarnished crown was originally worn by a maddened king, whose hunger for power could seemingly not be stopped. Only with old age was his reign brought to an eventual end, at which time all symbols of his power were systematically destroyed, including this crown. However, his malevolent spirit remains in the form of magical strands of force that hold its pieces together a lasting sign of his unwillingness to cede his rule.

The crown has the following properties.

## Curse Bestowment

While wearing this crown, you can use an action to touch a creature and cast the [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md) spell on it from the crown (save DC 16). If you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can cast the spell on that creature in this way (as if you were touching it) before the end of your next turn. You must be able to see the creature.

## Curse Suppression

While wearing this crown, any curse affecting you is suppressed. For each suppressed curse, you gain a +1 bonus to any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make (up to a maximum bonus of +3). Your attunement to a cursed magic item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, even if its effects are suppressed by the crown. Curses from an artifact can't be suppressed in this way.

## Rule of the Iron Fist

While attuned to the crown, your Strength and Charisma scores each increase by 2, up to a maximum of 22.

## Curse

This crown is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. The effects of this curse aren't suppressed by the crown's Curse Suppression, but nevertheless contribute to the bonus you gain as part of that property. You are immune to the effects of remove curse while wearing the crown.

While cursed, you gain the following flaw: "I am always in danger of losing everything. I must ensure my legacy is preserved." In addition, you are unwilling to part with the crown, wearing it atop your head at all times. It can't be removed from your head against your will.
