# Traveller's Clogs
*Wondrous item, common*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this pair of clogs, walking does not tire you as much. You are capable of walking 16 hours per day before being forced to make a Constitution saving throw against [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). After 16 hours, you must succeed on Constitution saving throws again like normal at the end of each hour, with the DC set as 10 + 1, for each hour past 16 hours.
