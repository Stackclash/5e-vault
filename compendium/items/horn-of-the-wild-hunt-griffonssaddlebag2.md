# Horn of the Wild Hunt
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Horn-of-the-Wild-Hunt.webp#right)  


This large, spiraling warhorn has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge and blow the horn, summoning a war elk as if you had cast the [find steed](compendium/spells/find-steed.md) spell. A war elk uses the same statistics as a [giant elk](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-elk.md) with the following changes: its size is Large, it has AC 14 ([hide barding](compendium/items/barding.md)), and has 37 hit points. The steed disappears if your attunement to the horn ends.

Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of the horn's charges to speak its command word and then blow the horn. When you do, a spectral stampede of elk trample the area in a line 60 feet long and 15 feet wide that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) force damage and is knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

When you blow the horn, it emits a deep, rumbling tone that is audible 300 feet away.
