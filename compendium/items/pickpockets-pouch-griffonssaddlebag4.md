# Pickpocket's Pouch
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Pickpockets-Pouch.webp#right)  


This black leather bag sits on your hip to provide easy access when depositing handheld items. It opens and closes silently, and it can stretch to fit about 1 cubic foot of space. You gain a +1 bonus to Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) checks made while wearing this bag. Objects in the bag can't be detected or seen by divination magic, such as by the [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell or locate object.

The bag has a latch that can be opened in one of two ways. Opening it the first way reveals the inside of the bag as normal. Opening it the second way causes an illusion to appear over the objects in the bag; the illusion is of five loose copper pieces, a quill and ink, and a waterskin. To discern that the contents are an illusion, a creature can use its action to inspect the pouch and must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. The illusion also fails to hold up to physical inspection.
