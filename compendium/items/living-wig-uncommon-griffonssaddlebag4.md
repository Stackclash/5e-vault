# Living Wig (Uncommon)
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Living-Wig.webp#right)  


A typical living wig, a common item, resembles a nondescript head covering of hair when found. While wearing it, you can mentally cause its hairstyle and color to change over the course of 1 minute: you must be wearing the wig for the duration. The wig can be used to grow facial hair in this way, although it must be connected to the rest of the hair. The wig produces real hair as short as a quarter inch and as long as 3 feet. Any hair that's cut immediately turns to ash and releases a smell of burnt hair. Wearing or removing the wig requires an action. It reverts to its normal form when removed.
