# Purple Worm Bulb
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

A bulbous mushroom that resembles a miniature version of a [purple worm](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) segment. The resemblance is far from a coincidence however, as the fungus is in fact linked to its namesake creature, as it only appears in tunnels and cave systems that they have burrowed throughâ€”growing inside the sizable droppings left by the gargantuan monsters. By absorbing even the tiniest fraction of the [purple worm](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md), this herb is able to impart some of the strength of the legendary creature to anyone that uses it.

## Effect:

After using this herb, your body undergoes a transformation and takes upon several aspects of a [purple worm](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) for the next 4 hours. During this time, you gain the following features:

- Purple scales grow over your body, raising your AC to 18 if it was lower than that already.  
- Your fingers sprout claws that resemble that of a [purple worm's](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) spikes, granting you a burrow speed of 20 feet. You may also use these claws to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage of a normal unarmed strike.  
- As an action, you may spit acid in a 10-foot cone in front of you. Any creature in this cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) acid damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful one. Once you have used this ability once, you may not use it again until you finish a short or long rest.  
- You gain a [tremorsense](/compendium/rules/senses.md#tremorsense) out to a range of 60 feet.
