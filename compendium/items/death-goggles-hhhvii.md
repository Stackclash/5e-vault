# Death Goggles
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing these goggles, you may spend your action to target a humanoid within 30 feet of you. If that humanoid is unwilling, they may make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effects of this item. If they are willing, or if they fail the saving throw, you immediately gain the targeted humanoid's memory of the most recent time in which they killed another humanoid. If that killing happened within the past 24 hours, they also suffer `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) psychic damage.

If the targeted humanoid has never killed another humanoid, you instead become [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute.
