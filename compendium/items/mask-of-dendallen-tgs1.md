# Mask of Dendallen
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Mask-of-Dendallen.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

This skull mask covers the top of your face and offers several benefits while worn. The mask has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the mask, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md), [fear](compendium/spells/fear.md), [speak with dead](compendium/spells/speak-with-dead.md), or [tongues](compendium/spells/tongues.md). You have advantage on Constitution saving throws you make in order to maintain concentration on a spell you cast in this way. In addition, you can read all writing.

## Curse

When you place this mask over your face for the first time, make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On a success, you are aware of the curse's effects and can immediately remove the mask before it extends the curse to you. On a failure, you take `dice:5d10|noform|avg` (`5d10`) psychic damage as the curse extends to you and magically latches onto your face. As long as you remain cursed, the mask can't be removed unless targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, and the skin surrounding the mask is riddled with blackened veins and sickly gray skin. While wearing this mask, you can't smell or taste anything and automatically fail any check relying on smell or taste. Your voice also changes. Use the table below to determine the new voice. In addition, whenever you roll a 1 on an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, you take `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage.

`dice: [](mask-of-dendallen-tgs1.md#^mask-of-dendallen-effects)`

| dice: d6 | Change to your voice |
|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | Your voice deepens and does not echo. |
| 2 | Your voice becomes raspy and you overly enunciate consonant sounds. |
| 3 | Your voice becomes quiet, almost a whisper, but can still be heard as if spoken at a normal volume. |
| 4 | Your voice becomes high-pitched, and your laugh maniacal. |
| 5 | You slur your words, as if your tongue is suddenly too large for your mouth, and your spit releases a faint hiss as it escapes your mouth. |
| 6 | Your voice becomes that of another ally's and changes each time you complete a long rest. |
