- **Damage**: 1d12 P
- **Properties**: [Reach](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [special](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Special%20Weapons)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This magical, gruesome lance can drain the life force from another creature. The first time on your turn when you hit a hostile living creature with a melee weapon attack using the lance, you deal an extra `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) necrotic damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt, rounded up. Temporary hit points gained from this attack fade after one hour.

## Special

You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
