# Staff of the Reverent Warrior
*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-the-Reverent-Warrior.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff was made as a means of worship rather than war by a retired warrior using the weapons he'd once wielded. The staff is adorned with blades and channels the inner focus of a warrior. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, attacks made with this weapon can deal either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).

This staff has 10 charges. While attuned to the staff, you know the [true strike](compendium/spells/true-strike.md) cantrip and can cast it at will. When you cast this spell while holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to enhance the spell in one or more of the following ways:

- You can expend 1 charge to reveal the target's weaknesses to your allies instead of merely yourself, causing the next attack roll made against the target to have advantage instead.  
- You can expend 1 charge to cast the spell as a bonus action, instead of as an action.  
- You can expend 1 charge to cast the spell without it requiring concentration.  
- You can expend 1 charge to cause the target to take an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) damage from the next attack that hits it.  

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff, but can still be used to deal either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage with its attacks.
