# Helm of the Cryptkeeper
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVII/HelmoftheCryptkeeper.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this helm, you may spend your action to target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you that has an Intelligence score of less than 10. That undead creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become your servant for 1 minute. While an undead creature is your servant, you may issue simple commands to them while you are conscious through a telepathic link you share (no action required), so long as you are both on the same plane of existence. A simple command is a general course of action such as "Attack that creature", "Run over there", or "Fetch that object". If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time your servant takes damage, it may make a new Wisdom saving throw against this effect, ending it on a success. You may only have one servant at a time. Attempting to make another undead creature your servant instantly causes this effect to end on your old one. An undead that has successfully saved against this ability is immune to this item for the next 24 hours.
