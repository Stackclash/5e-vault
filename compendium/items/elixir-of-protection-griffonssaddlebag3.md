# Elixir of Protection
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


FOR [HEDGE MAGE](compendium/classes/wizard-hedge-mage-griffonssaddlebag3.md#Hedge%20Mage%20(Level%202)) USE ONLY

Ingredients: A snails shell, sage leaf, and piece of limestone (acid damage), salt crystal (cold damage), red pepper seed ( fire damage), piece of iron ( lightning damage), or snake fang (poison damage).

Command: "Born of the Material, unscathed by her arms."

When you drink this elixir, your body becomes magically protected against either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage for 1 hour. You determine the type of damage when you create the elixir. For the duration, any damage of that type that you take is reduced by an amount equal to half your wizard level.
