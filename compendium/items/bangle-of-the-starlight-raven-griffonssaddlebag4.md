# Bangle of the Starlight Raven
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Bangle-of-the-Starlight-Raven.webp#right)  


This silver bangle feels almost cool or wet to the touch. Pressing its tail feathers inward causes its wings to unfurl, allowing you to place the bangle on your wrist or remove it. While wearing the bangle, gravity pulls more loosely against you: your weight is halved, and your normal jumping distance is doubled. While wearing it between dusk and dawn, you're also under the effects of the [feather fall](compendium/spells/feather-fall.md) spell.

The bangle has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dusk. The illusory ravens produced by these properties appear like moving constellations of starlight. Using a property requires an action.

## Starlight Messenger

You can expend 3 of the bangle's charges to cast the [sending](compendium/spells/sending.md) spell, or 2 charges between dusk and dawn. When you do, an illusory raven instantly appears before the recipient to deliver your message to it. The recipient's reply is then delivered to you the same way, at which point the raven vanishes.

## Stars' Guidance

You can expend 2 of the bangle's charges to cast the [locate object](compendium/spells/locate-object.md) spell, or 1 charge between dusk and dawn. When you do, an illusory raven appears on your shoulder to direct you toward the object for the duration, provided it's within range.

## Starstruck Swarm

You can expend 1 or more of the bangle's charges to cast the [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell, or the 2nd-level version of the spell between dusk and dawn. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The missiles appear as the illusory ravens hurtling toward each target.
