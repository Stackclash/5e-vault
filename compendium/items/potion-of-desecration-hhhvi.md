# Potion of Desecration
*Potion, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you become cursed. While cursed in this way, you gain [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to 120 ft. if you did not have it already, and whenever you receive necrotic damage, you instead heal the amount of damage you would have taken. In addition, whenever an undead creature with less than 10 Intelligence targets you with a harmful attack or spell, it must first make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.

Every night at midnight while cursed, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become dominated by the [death knight](compendium/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md) from whose blood this potion was crafted, as if under the effect of the [dominate person](compendium/spells/dominate-person.md) spell, but with an indefinite duration, no concentration required, and unlimited range. The death knight is aware of this taking place unless it is on a different plane of existence.

This curse can only be removed if the death knight from whom the blood was taken is permanently destroyed, after which point the curse immediately ends.
