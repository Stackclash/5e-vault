A mote of swirling, magic water circles the top of this wooden staff. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you make a melee attack with the staff, you can choose to extend and lash out with the water, instead of the staff. When you do, the water has a range of 10 feet and deals `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) bludgeoning damage if it hits. You're proficient with this attack and use your Wisdom modifier for its attack and damage rolls. After the attack, the water shrinks back to the staff.

While holding the staff, you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground. If you end your turn on a liquid in this way, you sink into it as normal until you stand on solid ground again. In addition, while holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the [control water](compendium/spells/control-water.md) spell (*Flood* or *Part Water* only) from it. The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the staff. Once the staff's been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
