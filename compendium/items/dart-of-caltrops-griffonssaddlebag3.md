# Dart of Caltrops
*Weapon ([dart](compendium/items/dart.md)), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Dart-of-Caltrops.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 0.25 lbs.

The tip of this all-metal dart resembles a single caltrop. If you hit a creature with a ranged attack using the dart, that creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until it regains at least 1 hit point (as if it had stepped on spread caltrops). Hit or miss, countless, magical caltrops burst from the dart to cover the ground in each space adjacent to the target. The caltrops remain for 1 minute, at which point they turn to dust and are destroyed.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the dart can still be used as a magic weapon.
