# Trumpeting Ring
*Ring, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Trumpeting-Ring.webp#right)  


This ring looks like a miniature trumpet that's wrapped around your finger. While wearing it, you can use an action to hold your hand in one of three ways, as if pantomiming holding a larger trumpet, to magically create a unique effect.

## Bugle

While holding your hand to your mouth, keeping your thumb closed in a circle with your index and middle fingers and slightly splaying the rest, anything you say is spoken at up to three times the normal volume.

## Ear Trumpet

While holding your hand to your ear, as if holding an ear trumpet, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks you make that rely on hearing. In addition, if you're [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), you can hear about half as well as normal while holding your hand in this way; you make any check that relies on hearing for the duration with disadvantage.

## Trumpet

While holding your closed hand to your mouth, as if holding a trumpet, you can recreate the sounds of a normal trumpet or similar instrument. If you are proficient with wind instruments, you are proficient with this trumpet, and if you're a bard, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
