# Potion of the Duergar
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When you drink this potion, you gain the ability to cast the [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) and [minor illusion](compendium/spells/minor-illusion.md) spells at will for the next hour. This thick, grey potion seems to move around by itself as if acted on by an invisible force.
