# Cloak of Dragonflight
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This long cloak resembles the leathery membranes of a dragon's wings and shines the same shade as the dragon from whom it was crafted. While wearing this cloak, you may speak the command word to transform them into a pair of dragon wings on your back. They remains in this form for 6 hours or until you speak the command word again. The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet, and resistance to the damage type corresponding to the dragon from whom it was crafted. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
