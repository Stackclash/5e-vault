This magic whip hums with electricity. It has 4 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with this whip, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage to that creature for each charge you spend. You don't suffer the negative effects of underwater fighting when you make an attack with this weapon.

When you hit an underwater creature with this whip, it automatically takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage from the attack as if you had expended a charge from it. When this happens, you can still spend charges from the whip to deal additional lightning damage to the creature. If you do, each other creature of your choice within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take lightning damage equal to half the amount dealt to the target.
