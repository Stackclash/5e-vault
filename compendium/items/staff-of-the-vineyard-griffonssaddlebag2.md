# Staff of the Vineyard
*Staff, weapon ([quarterstaff](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, monk, or ranger)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Staff-of-the-Vineyard.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. A clutch of up to 10 grapes hangs from the end of the staff's magical length of vine. A creature within reach of the staff can use an action to eat one of the grapes, which duplicates the effect of eating a berry from the [goodberry](compendium/spells/goodberry.md) spell. `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) eaten grapes regrow on the clutch daily at dawn.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md) spell from it (save DC 13), causing twisting grapevines to sprout from the ground in the target area. If a creature [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by these vines makes a Strength check to free itself and fails, that creature becomes magically drunk until the end of its next turn. A drunk creature is [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for the duration. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
