# Great Owl's Crown

You gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws while wearing this crown, and you can understand and speak to owls and owlbears.

The crown has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the crown, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to detect if there are any [owl](compendium/bestiary/beast/owl.md)s or [owlbear](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md)s within 1000 feet of you. If you detect any owls or owlbears within the crown's range, you learn the direction and distance to the closest one. Alternatively, you can expend 1 of the crown's charges to cast the [animal messenger](compendium/spells/animal-messenger.md) spell from it, which must target a beast with a flying speed.
