![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Direstone-Dwarven-Pick.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P

This old, weathered war pick is able to effortlessly break and mold stone. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Creatures and objects made of stone that are hit by the war pick take an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) piercing damage from the attack. In addition, the weapon has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [meld into stone](compendium/spells/meld-into-stone.md) or [stone shape](compendium/spells/stone-shape.md) spell using the weapon.
