*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This item has 9 charges. While holding this loupe to your eye, you have advantage on any Intelligence checks made to gain knowledge on a nautical or aquatic subject. In addition, you may spend an action and 1 or more charges to do any of the following:

- You gain [truesight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#truesight) out to a range of 120 feet for one hour (1 charge).  
- You gain telepathy out to a range of 120 feet for one hour. This telepathy allows you to communicate with marine life who are capable of responding with basic emotions and images, however you gain no special ability to command them (1 charge).  
- You gain the ability to understand the waves and the wind for the next 24 hours. During this time, you automatically succeed on any ability check to navigate a course at sea (2 charges).  
- You magically create up to three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target you can see within 120 feet of you. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 4d10|avg` (`4d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (1 charge per lightning bolt).  

This item regains `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) charges daily at dawn.
