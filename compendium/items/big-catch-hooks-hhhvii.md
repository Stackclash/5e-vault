# Big Catch Hooks
*Wondrous item, common*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

This set of 10 hooks are carved from sea spawn teeth and may be attached to any standard fishing rod. Any fish within 10 feet of this hook that can see it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the hook for 1 minute.

While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, the fish must spend their movement each turn moving as close to the hook as possible, and their action to bite onto the hook if they can reach it. A [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) fish may attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of its turns or whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. A fish that succeeds on their saving throw is immune to the effect of this hook for 24 hours.
