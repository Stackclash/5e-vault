# Tome of Planar Wonderings and Wanderings
*Wondrous item, major, legendary*

This book contains musings and detailed intricacies of the nature of the Planes of Existence throughout the multiverse. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores each increase by 1. If either your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score is already at its maximum, you can increase one of the other two scores by 2, instead of 1.

In addition, you gain the ability to magically sense the presence of planar portals or extradimensional spaces. As an action, you detect the distance and direction to either the closest planar portal within 3 miles of you or to the nearest opening to an extradimensional space within 30 feet of you. When you finish studying this book it loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
