# Candy Xorn
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Candy-Xorn.webp#right)  


Candy xorn is a round, waxy candy that typically comes in small bags of `dice:2d6+3|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 3`) pieces. Each piece is traditionally either orange or yellow, but always has a narrow, reptilian pupil drawn at its center. Eating a candy xorn causes your eyes to turn orange or yellow (your choice), and your pupils to match the ones found on the piece of candy. After 1 minute, the effect ends and your eyes return to normal.

In addition, each piece of candy xorn has a 5 percent chance to not be candy at all, but actually a gemstone covered in the sugared coating. When you find a gemstone in this way, it can be either [eye agate](compendium/items/eye-agate.md) (40%, 10 gp), [tiger's eye](compendium/items/tiger-eye.md) (40%, 10 gp), or [amber](compendium/items/amber.md) (20%, 100 gp).
