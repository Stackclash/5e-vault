# Toadstone
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Toadstone.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

This small jade carving of a frog dangles from a simple cord of leather to be worn as a necklace. While you wear it, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and can hold your breath for up to 1 hour. In addition, you can cast the [jump](compendium/spells/jump.md) spell using the necklace, targeting only yourself. Once the necklace has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dusk.

## Curse

This necklace is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you're targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the necklace fails to end the curse on you. While you're cursed, your skin is perpetually slightly wet and clammy, and you have only an appetite for insects and other grubs instead of the foods you would normally enjoy eating.
