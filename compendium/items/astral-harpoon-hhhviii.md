# Astral Harpoon
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

When fired from a [ballista](compendium/objects/ballista.md) or similar firing mechanism, this harpoon has a +3 to attack and damage rolls and deals `dice:6d10|noform|avg` (`6d10`) piercing damage instead of the normal amount of damage. When firing this destructive harpoon, if you roll a 20 on your attack roll against a non-magical ship, you cause catastrophic hull damage that causes fractures and breakages to compound. For the next minute, the struck ship suffers `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) piercing damage ^[This is a homebrew addition] at the end of each round.
