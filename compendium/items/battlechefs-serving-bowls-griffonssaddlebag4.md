# Battlechef's Serving Bowls
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Battlechefs-Serving-Bowls.webp#right)  


This pair of silver serving bowls is scratched from seeing battle. Their handles are wrapped with leather straps, allowing you to wear them as pauldrons. It takes 1 minute to attach the bowls to your shoulders or remove them. Whenever you take acid or poison damage while wearing the bowls as pauldrons, you reduce that damage by `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`). For each other item you're holding or wearing that has battlechef in the name, the acid or poison damage is reduced by an additional `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`).

If you use the bowls to serve food from, any poison within the food is neutralized.
