# Borboss' Joyous Wand of Color
*Wand, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Borboss-Joyous-Wand-of-Color.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This crystalline, prismatic wand can channel the illustrative intent of its wielder. While holding the wand, you can magically create a stroke of color in the air, allowing you to draw in midair or on any surface the wand touches. The effect is illusory, visibly magical, radiates dim light out to 5 feet, and dissipates after 1 hour.

If you attempt to draw on an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw in order to avoid it.
