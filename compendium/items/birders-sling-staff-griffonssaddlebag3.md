- **Damage**:

This magic quarterstaff is decorated with bird ornaments and equipped with a sling at its top. A nest sits in the crook of the sling. You can use the quarterstaff as if it were a sling, provided you hold it with two hands. When you do, the sling's damage die increases to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) and its normal and long ranges are doubled.

The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. While holding it, you have advantage on any ability check made to interact with, recall lore about, or track birds.

## Speak with Birds

While holding the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [speak with animals](compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md) spell. This version of the spell only allows you to speak to beasts that have a flying speed.

## Two Birds, One Stone

When you make a ranged attack using the quarterstaff's sling, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the sling bullet to transform into a pair of birds mid-flight. The birds then attack the target. Make an attack roll for each bird. On a hit, a bird deals `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage. If you are proficient in the [Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling) skill, you can use your Wisdom modifier for these attack and damage rolls, instead of Dexterity. The birds disappear immediately after the attack.

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge from the staff, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff ceases to regain charges and loses its Speak with Birds and Two Birds, One Stone properties.
