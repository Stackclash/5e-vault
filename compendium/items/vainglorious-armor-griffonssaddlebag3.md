# Vainglorious Armor
*Heavy armor ([ring mail](compendium/items/ring-mail.md)), cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Vainglorious-Armor.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14
- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

The torso of this glimmering ring mail is guarded by hundreds of golden, interlocked signet rings. It's always magically clean. While wearing it, you gain a bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier (maximum 5). When you make an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll and roll a 20 on the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`), you're bolstered by a wave of confidence: you have advantage on the next Charisma check or Charisma saving throw you make within the next minute.

## Curse

This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. While you're cursed, you gain the following flaw: "I am easily embarrassed." Furthermore, whenever you make an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll and roll a 1 on the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`), any Charisma check or Charisma saving throw you make for the next minute is made with disadvantage.
