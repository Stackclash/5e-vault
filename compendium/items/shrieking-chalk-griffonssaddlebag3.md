# Shrieking Chalk
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Shrieking-Chalk.webp#right)  


This piece of chalk doesn't make any marks when used to write with. Instead, it only releases an ear-splitting shriek, which is audible out to a range of 300 feet. You can use an action to scrape the chalk against a solid surface within your reach. When you do, any creature that can hear the chalk within 30 feet of it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) psychic damage and is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until the start of your next turn, as it's overwhelmed by the horrific sound. On a success, a creature takes half as much psychic damage and isn't [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). If a creature is holding anything when it fails the saving throw, it immediately drops what it's holding and cover its ears (provided that it has them). Creatures that have a trait which grants them advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing have disadvantage on this saving throw.

There's enough chalk for three uses. It grows smaller with each use. Once the chalk is used a third time, any remaining fragments are turned to dust and destroyed.
