# Club of Dancing
*Weapon ([club](compendium/items/club.md)), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Club-of-Dancing.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 B
- **Properties**: [Light](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This metallic club emits prismatic flashes of light whenever it hits a target. While you're holding this weapon, you can use an action to cast the dancing lights spell from it. In addition, the club has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) thunder damage. If the target is a creature, it must also make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature's speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn, and it spends its action on its next turn dancing in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering.
