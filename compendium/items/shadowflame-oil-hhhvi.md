# Shadowflame Oil
*Oil, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

The oil in this vial can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit by this weapon or ammunition takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage. If this weapon or ammunition kills a creature, a [shadow](compendium/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) under your control rises from that corpse[...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (refer to the Monster Manual for the relevant statblock)]. This shadow acts directly after you in the initiative count and disappears after 1 hour or if it or you fall [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).
