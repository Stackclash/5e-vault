# Staff of Striking
*Staff, weapon, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) force damage. The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
