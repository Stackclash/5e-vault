# Clangor Helmet
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Clangor-Helmet.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This helmet was made from a temple bell and weighs 10 pounds. While wearing it, you have resistance to thunder damage and can't be [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened). In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you deals bludgeoning damage to you with a melee attack, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 5 or 6, the attacking creature takes 5 or 6 thunder damage, respectively.
