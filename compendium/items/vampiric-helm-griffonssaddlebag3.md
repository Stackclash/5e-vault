# Vampiric Helm
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Vampiric-Helm.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Cursed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

While wearing this helmet, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing and have [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) out to 10 feet, provided that you're not [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened).

## Curse

Once you don this cursed helmet, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. While wearing the helmet, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against vampires (or vampire spawn) and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.

In addition, your teeth grow pointed, and you hunger for blood. If you enter a space within 5 feet of a [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) or [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature on your turn or start your turn there, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. You can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failure, you're compelled to use your action to make an unarmed strike against that creature, biting it on a hit. The bite deals piercing damage equal to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike, plus `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage. You then gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
