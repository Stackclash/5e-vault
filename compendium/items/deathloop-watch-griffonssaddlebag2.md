# Deathloop Watch
*Wondrous item, minor, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Deathloop-Watch.webp#right)  


This golden pocket watch has a skull-shaped lid with three panes of blue glass that cover its two eyes and nose. At the center of the watch is a secondary dial with a small, skeletal hand that indicates the amount of hit points you have remaining. If you die while the watch is on your person, the watch reverses your personal time stream just long enough to keep you alive, returning you to life with 1 hit point and allowing you to immediately stand up. When the watch reverses time in this way, one of the watch's three glass panes cracks and can't be repaired by mundane or magical means. For each pane of cracked glass, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that the watch fails to reverse time when you die. When all three panes of glass are cracked, the watch becomes nonmagical, although it can still be used to tell the time.
