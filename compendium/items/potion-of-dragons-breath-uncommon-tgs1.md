# Potion of Dragon's Breath (uncommon)
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Potion-of-Dragons-Breath.webp#right)  


This potion is crafted using the harvested stomach and gizzard of a fallen dragon. Drinking the potion as an action allows you to use an action on your subsequent turns to spew dragon-like projectiles. These projectiles are the same as a dragonborn's breath weapon, whose element and areas of effect are determined by the dragon it was sourced from. The effect lasts for 1 minute. Materials gathered from young dragons produce uncommon potions (dealing `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) damage with the breath weapon, save DC 13).

It takes 7 days and proficiency with [alchemist's supplies](compendium/items/alchemists-supplies.md) to create the potion, requiring 2 hours of work each day in order to prepare it. Failing to tend to the potion causes it to reset, requiring another 7 days to craft. When the potion resets in this way, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the potion spoils and is lost.
