# Clay Weapon
*Generic Variant, rare (requires attunement)*  


You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. While holding this weapon, you may spend an action to magically enhance your agility, giving you a +2 bonus to your AC, advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and the ability to make one basic melee weapon attack as a bonus action. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the end of your next short rest.
