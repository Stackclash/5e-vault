# Interrogator's Web
*Weapon ([net](compendium/items/net.md)), rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by), [Thrown](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown), [special](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Special%20Weapons)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This large net is composed of the web-like connective tissue of an elder brain. If there is a creature caught in this net, you may spend your action holding onto the net and focusing on that creature. If you do so, you gain one memory or fact from that creature's mind. The memory or fact may be one that you specifically search for, otherwise you gain a random one chosen by the DM.

A creature may use its action to make a DC 20 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 20 slashing damage to the net (AC 15) also frees the creature, ending the effect and destroying the net.
