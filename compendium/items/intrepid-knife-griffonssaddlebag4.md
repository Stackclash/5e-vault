This short, run-of-the-mill dagger can make the timid feel brave, and is a common prop for storytellers. Whenever you make an attack with this weapon, you can create a small, harmless effect in its wake, such as a trail of sparkles or satisfying "whoosh" sound. The effect ends immediately after the attack. In addition, if you're holding the dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to any saving throw you make against being [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
