# Silver Sword
*Weapon, major (requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [astral projection](compendium/spells/astral-projection.md) spell), you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
