# Bandolier of the Elements
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bandolier-of-the-Elements.webp#right)  


This cross-chest bandolier has 6 magic [daggers](compendium/items/dagger.md) sheathed across it. When you take the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action while wearing this bandolier, you can use a bonus action to throw 1 of the daggers, making a ranged attack with it, provided you have a free hand. When you hit a target with one of these daggers, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) and consult the table below. The target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage of the type determined by the table, in addition to the weapon's damage, and the dagger disappears. On a miss, the dagger vanishes and reappears in the bandolier.

A [dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md) vanishes if you don't hurl it right away and immediately reappears in the bandolier. `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) missing daggers reappear in the bandolier's empty sheaths daily at dawn.
