# Living Wig (Rare)
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Living-Wig.webp#right)  


A typical living wig, a common item, resembles a nondescript head covering of hair when found. While wearing it, you can mentally cause its hairstyle and color to change over the course of 1 minute: you must be wearing the wig for the duration. The wig can be used to grow facial hair in this way, although it must be connected to the rest of the hair. The wig produces real hair as short as a quarter inch and as long as 3 feet. Any hair that's cut immediately turns to ash and releases a smell of burnt hair. Wearing or removing the wig requires an action. It reverts to its normal form when removed.

The following living wig is a rare variant with additional properties. It also looks better.

## Sentience

Living wigs are sometimes made using the hair of celebrities or renowned persons. While the market for such wigs is always eager, getting them can be a challenge. As a result, some of these wigs are made by questionable means, with or without the hair owner's knowledge. After a time, such a living wig can become inhabited by the departed spirit of its hair's original owner. A sentient wig's alignment and personality are the same as the original owner's were in life, as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The wig has hearing and [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.

The wig communicates telepathically with the creature wearing it and can speak, read, and understand the languages it knew in life.

## Bonus Proficiencies

If you've been wearing the wig for more than 24 consecutive hours, you gain proficiency with two random skills, tools, or languages based on the background of the wig hair's original owner. At the GM's discretion, you may be able to gain the benefits of that background's feature.

## Destroying the Wig

If the wig is targeted by a [dispel evil and good](compendium/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md) spell, it becomes a common living wig with no additional properties.
