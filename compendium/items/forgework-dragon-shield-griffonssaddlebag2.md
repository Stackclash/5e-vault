# Forgework Dragon Shield
*Armor ([shield](compendium/items/shield.md)), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Forgework-Dragon-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this plated brass shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. The shield has a metallic maw in the visage of a dragon forged into the face of the shield, and small plumes of flame occasionally leap from openings in the shield's plates.

When a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to retaliate with the shield. When you do, a gout of flame erupts from the shield, forcing the attacker to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) fire damage and ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't ignite. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
