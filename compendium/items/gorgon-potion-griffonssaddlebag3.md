# Gorgon Potion
*Potion, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Gorgon-Potion.webp#right)  


This potion contains trace amounts of gorgon blood. When you drink this potion, you're immune to being [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) hours. If you're already [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified), another creature can apply the potion to you and suspend the effect for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) hours instead. In either case, for the duration of the potion's effects, your skin hardens into flexible metal plates; your AC can't be lower than 18.

While under the effects of the potion, you can use an action to exhale a plume of green vapor from you in a 15-foot cone. When you do, the potion's effects on you end, and both you and any other creature within the area of the vapor must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). The [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature must make another DC13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 minute.
