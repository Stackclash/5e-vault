# Golden Truffle
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [Herb](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Herb)
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A delicacy sought by nobles and wealthy merchants from across the world, the golden truffle is renowned for both its heady distinctive flavour as well as its purported medicinal properties. While it is possible to spend time and effort to find these buried treasures by oneself, enterprising farmers have learned how to train other creatures to sniff and seek them out.Reportedly, the best companion for the job is the ever-threatening [owlbear](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md), as their sharp sense of smell and unwillingness to eat the truffles themselves makes them perfect for the jobâ€”if you can train them not to try and eat you first.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) charges. You may expend one charge to use this herb, after which, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to double your character level, and you gain the same amount of hit points. This increase lasts for 4 hours, after which, your maximum hit points return to normal.
