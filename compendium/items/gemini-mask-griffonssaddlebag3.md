# Gemini Mask
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Gemini-Mask.webp#right)  


This half-mask remains securely on your face thanks to its full-width diadem, which extends from the mask around the rest of your brow. It functions as a [hat of disguise](compendium/items/hat-of-disguise.md). When you use an action to cast the [disguise self](compendium/spells/disguise-self.md) spell from the mask, you can choose to appear identical to another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do, you can appear up to 3 feet shorter or taller to match the target's height.

## Twin Sense

For the duration of this version of the spell, you gain the following benefits:

- You always know the general direction and distance of the other creature from you.  
- When the other creature makes an attack against a target, you gain advantage on the first attack roll you make against the same target before the start of the other creature's next turn.  
- You can use an action to see through the creature's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. If the creature is unwilling, it first makes an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, it's magically made aware of this effect though not of you or its source and the spell and effect ends. If a creature is immune to divination magic or is under the effects of a spell or magical effect that prevents such magic, you see and hear nothing from the creature's senses, and it automatically succeeds on the saving throw.  
- The spell ends early if you're more than 1 mile away from the other creature.
