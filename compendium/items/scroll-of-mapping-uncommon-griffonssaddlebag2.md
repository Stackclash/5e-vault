# Scroll of Mapping (Uncommon)
*Scroll, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Scroll-of-Mapping.webp#right)  


By using an action to read the scroll, you cause the arcane script on the page to vanish and become an inked map of the surrounding area. The map shows the area in a 1-mile radius centered on the point where you read the scroll and indicates both structures and topography. By touching the map, a small light appears at your location to indicate where you are. Using a series of natural gestures when touching the page, you can cause the map to change its scale or displayed portion of the area. The scroll isn't destroyed when you read it, but can't be used again to create a different map.
