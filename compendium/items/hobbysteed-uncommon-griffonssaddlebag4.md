# Hobbysteed (Uncommon)
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Hobbysteed.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

While holding this stuffed hobby horse, which weighs 2 pounds, you can mount or dismount it as if it were a normal steed. While mounted, you can use an action to speak its command word: a ghostly steed then appears beneath you, which is translucent and obviously magical. The steed uses the statistics for a [riding horse](compendium/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md), although its weight is always 2 pounds. You can ride it for up to 1 hour, all at once or in several shorter intervals, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. The hobbysteed regains 30 minutes of riding capability for every 4 hours it isn't in use. The effect ends early if you or the steed take any damage or if you're no longer holding or riding the hobby horse.

The toy horse head of every hobbysteed is unique in its appearance, and typically creates a horse that resembles it.
