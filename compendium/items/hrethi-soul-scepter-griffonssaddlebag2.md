# H'rethi Soul Scepter
*Rod, major, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Hrethi-Soul-Scepter.webp#right)  


This golden scepter has an empty basin at its end that's always hot to the touch, as if it had been left out in the sun. While attuned to the rod, you can walk normally on difficult terrain caused by sand and can tolerate temperatures as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

The rod has 20 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:2d6+8|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 8`) expended charges daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of sand.

## Sandblast

While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and send out a cascade of pressurized sand at a target you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll using the scepter with an attack bonus of +10. On a hit, the sand deals `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage and disappears after the attack.

## Sandstorm

While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 5 charges to cause a flurry of sand to whip up and swirl around you. The sand creates a blistering maelstrom that follows you in a 15-foot radius, 30-foot-high cylinder and makes the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles fly upward and automatically miss when they enter the area. Any creature that moves into the sandstorm for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You are immune to this bludgeoning damage. The sand disappears once the storm subsides.

If you are standing on sandy ground while concentrating on a sandstorm, you can use a bonus action to teleport to another unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you that is also on sandy ground.

## Sand Summon

While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to cause the ground in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you to turn to shifting sands for up to 1 minute. You can end the effect early as a bonus action. For the duration, a creature must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves through the area.

## Soul of the H'rethi

While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to summon a sand elemental in an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet of you that's covered in sand. Use the statistics for an [earth elemental](compendium/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) for this elemental, with the following changes:

- The sand elemental can only move through areas of sandy terrain.  
- The sand elemental has advantage on any ability check it makes to [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) a creature.  

The elemental remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to a maximum of 1 hour, and disappears early if it drops to 0 hit points. It is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
