# Scroll of Momentary Omniscience
*Scroll, minor, rare*

When you use an action to read this scroll, everything becomes perfectly clear in a moment of fascinating realization. Despite the arcane phrase's manageable length, the scroll itself is outrageously long and filled with nonsensical grids, lists, smudged diagrams, and other strange musings. The scroll magically unrolls and tears itself in half once it's used, destroying the scroll. Choose one of the following benefits:

## Answer

When you finish reading the scroll, you must also ask a question to a creature that can hear you. The question needn't be answerable with a yes or no, but can only include one question. The target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. You know whether the creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. On a failure, you mentally learn the truthful answer to the question from the creature's perspective (if any). The knowledge and awareness of a creature is limited by its intelligence, but at minimum, a creature can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever it can perceive or has perceived within the past day. You learn the answer to this question even if the creature is unable to speak. If the question has multiple parts, or if the creature can't hear or doesn't understand the language in which you asked the question, the scroll fails and the effect is wasted.

## Direction

You immediately learn the most direct physical route to a creature, location, or object on your plane of existence at the time of reading the scroll. You must have at least secondhand knowledge of the target. You retain this information for 7 days, after which time the knowledge is lost. If the target moves during the duration, the route remains unchanged from when you first learned it.

## Solution

You immediately learn the solution to a cypher, puzzle, riddle, or similar quandary. If you decode a cypher in this way, such as a secret message or series of ancient glyphs, you also know how to speak, read, and write it for the next 7 days, after which time the knowledge is lost.
