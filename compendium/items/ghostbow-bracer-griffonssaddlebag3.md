# Ghostbow Bracer
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Ghostbow-Bracer.webp#right)  


This leather bracer has a blue gemstone embedded on its wrist, which glimmers with an ethereal light. While wearing it, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made with longbows and shortbows.

## Summon Bow

You can use a bonus action to summon a spectral longbow or shortbow from the bracer's gemstone. The bow is weightless, allowing you to ignore the longbow's normal heavy property while holding it. The bow remains until you're holding another weapon, until you drop it, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While the weapon persists, it sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. It creates its own arrows, which magically appear in a nocked position whenever you draw the bow. Hit or miss, an arrow disappears after the attack or if you release the bowstring without firing the arrow.

Regardless of what bow you summon, it deals force damage instead of piercing damage.

## Charges

The bracer has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. The available properties are determined by the type of summoned bow.

## Grim Shot (Longbow or Shortbow)

When you hit a target with an arrow that was created by the summoned bow, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) force damage to the target. This damage is in addition to the attack's normal damage.

## Piercing Blast (Longbow)

When you take the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action using the summoned bow, you can replace one or more of your attacks with a special attack using the bow. You expend 2 charges per attack you replace in this way. When you do, you draw forth a cool beam of light from the weapon, instead of a spectral arrow. You fire this beam of light in a line from you that's 5 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature within the line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) force damage.

## Stepshot (Shortbow)

You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to make one ranged attack against a creature using the summoned bow. On a hit, you teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see that's within 15 feet of you. You can't teleport to a space that's closer to the target of the attack in this way.
