# Mantle of Security
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*

This soft cloak was once a child's beloved blanket and has been miraculously enchanted by their hopes and dreams. While worn as a cloak, you can't be [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and magic can't put you to sleep. When unclasped, it can still be used as a warm blanket. When used as a blanket while sleeping or over the course of a short or long rest, you can't be unwillingly targeted by the [dream](compendium/spells/dream.md) spell, you gain a +3 bonus to your passive Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score, and you can't be surprised as a result of being [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). Regardless of how the cloak is used, you can tolerate temperatures as low as âˆ’50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.
