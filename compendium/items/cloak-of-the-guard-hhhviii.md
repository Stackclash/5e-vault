# Cloak of the Guard
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [Crafted by](/compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Crafted%20by)

While wearing this cloak, you cannot be surprised so long as you aren't [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), and you may perform up to 4 hours of light activity during a long rest and still gain its benefits; this cloak must be worn during the entirety of the long rest in order for the latter ability to apply.
