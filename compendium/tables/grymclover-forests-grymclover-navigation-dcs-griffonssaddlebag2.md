# Grymclover Forests; Grymclover Navigation DCs
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 278* 

Finding your way through a forest that's been mutated like this is exceptionally difficult due to the dense brambles, thick canopy, and low visibility. When a character makes a Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to navigate to a specific location within the forest, consult the [Grymclover Navigation DCs](compendium/tables/grymclover-forests-grymclover-navigation-dcs-griffonssaddlebag2.md) table. On a failed check, they become lost and suffer a setback determined by the [Becoming Lost](compendium/tables/grymclover-forests-becoming-lost-griffonssaddlebag2.md) table.

| DC | Location |
|----|----------|
| 15 | A location on the outskirts of the wood, or near a larger settlement |
| 20 | A location near the center of the forest or steeped in Corruption, like most dungeons and ruins are |
| 25 | A location that is lost or hidden, such as a portal to the Fey or Shadow planes, a secret settlement, or a magically cloaked dungeon or ruin |
