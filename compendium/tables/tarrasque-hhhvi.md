| — | Tarrasque Heart | The dusty temple walls of some forgotten societies often depict what some believe to be a tarrasque heart. The heart seems to be placed in a position of reverence, the shadow of a tarrasque acting as a guardian for the city.<br /><br />**Use.** Activating a tarrasque heart requires the work of 10 spellcasters who have access to at least one 6th level spell slot or higher. Each spellcaster must spend 10 hours in constant contact and focus on the tarrasque heart. At the end of the 10 hours, they each expend a 6th level spell slot or higher. This process must be repeated for 30 consecutive days, after which, the heart will activate and create a protective enchantment in a dome centered on itself and with a radius of 3 miles. While they are alive and inside the protective enchantment, the spellcasters that activated the heart may choose to spend an action to target any number of creatures inside the protective enchantment and force them to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), with the entire area under the protective enchantment considered the source of the effect. While [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, a creature drops anything they are carrying and must use their full movement as well as any potential dash actions to run as far away from the protective enchantment as possible. A [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if they are within the protective enchantment. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. If any of the 10 spellcasters die after activating the heart, the heart deactivates and the activation process must start again. | Varies | 1,000 lb | — |
| — | Tarrasque Shell | A tarrasque shell is the hardest substance known to man, harder than even the legendary mithral and adamantine. As such, it is virtually impossible to chip off any shards to be used as personal shields or armor, and may only be used in its entirety. Modern scholars believe that the fabled elven ship, 'Skellbladnir' was actually crafted from the shell of a tarrasque, explaining many of its purported magical properties. | Varies | 100,000 lb | [The Titan Ship](compendium/items/titan-ship-hhhvi.md)<br /><br />> [!note]<br />> Also available as a [vehicle.](compendium/vehicles/titan-ship-hhhvi.md) |
| — | Tarrasque Horn | A tarrasque horn is said to make a battering ram powerful enough to breach the gates of Hades itself and free all evil that dwell within. While that remains to be tested, it is certainly strong enough to break down any structure made by mortals. Even today, horn fragments are always found in the same kind of place: the destroyed gates of an abandoned city.<br /><br />**Use.** The tarrasque horn may be used as a [ram](compendium/objects/ram.md) [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (Dungeon Master's Guide, Page 255)]. This ram has a `dice:1d20+14\|noform\|text(+14)` to hit and deals `dice:10d10|noform|avg|text(55)` (`10d10`) bludegoning damage and deals double damage against objects and structures. | Varies | 1,000 lb | — |
| — | Tarrasque Eye (×2) | The eyes of a tarrasque have witnessed countless civilisations lost to the annals of history (usually because they were destroyed by the tarrasque). That said, even though the tarrasque probably could not understand the majesty of what it was seeing, it still bore witness to them, and combined with its powerful inherent magic, that is enough for diviners to draw out the most ancient of secrets.<br /><br />**Use.** A creature casting the spell [legend lore](compendium/spells/legend-lore.md) may instead choose to use the tarrasque eye instead of the spell's usual components. This does not consume the eye. | Varies | 30 lb | — |
| — | Tarrasque Blood (×1,000 gallons) | Tarrasque blood flows in the deepest crimson, and every ounce of it is steeped in magical energy. Tarrasque blood is regarded as a universal catalyst, capable of being used as the base of almost any potion imaginable. It is said that spell circles drawn with a tarrasque's blood are capable of casting rituals powerful enough to challenge the gods themselves.<br /><br />**Use.** Tarrasque blood may be used to craft any other potion. Doing so requires 1 gallon of blood in place of the usual base component. No extra payment is required to craft the desired potion. | Varies | 9 lb | Any other potion |
| — | Tarrasque Flesh | Uncovered histories of destroyed civilisations speak of an ancient tribal nation of berserkers that roamed the land, razing and pillaging every city they came across. If the pictographs are understood correctly, the source of their ferocity came from the flesh of a tarrasque that they consumed before every battle. Where they got the strength to take down a tarrasque in the first place is another mystery entirely.<br /><br />**Use.** If a creature consumes 1 pound of tarrasque flesh, they gain a Strength score of 30 for the next 24 hours. At the end of this period, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer 4 points of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) as their mortal body attempts to process the extreme power it just consumed. | Varies | 10,000 lb | — |
