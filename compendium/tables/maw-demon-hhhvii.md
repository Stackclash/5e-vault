# Maw Demon
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 15* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Maw Demon Teeth (large bag) | These jagged, uneven teeth are incredibly sharp and capable of rending meat from bone easier than a hot knife through butter. The nefarious magic in them make them wonderful materials for a morbidly amusing little trinket. | 1 gp | 7 lb | [Portable Mouth](compendium/items/portable-mouth-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Maw Demon Stomach | **.** The unholy stomach of a maw demon actually doubles as a portal to the Abyss, usually leading directly to [Yeenoghu's](compendium/bestiary/npc/yeenoghu-mpmm.md) gullet. With only some slight alteration however, this stomach can be properly harvested and treated to act as a slightly different conduit for lesser demons.<br /><br />**Use.** If you cast the [summon lesser demons](compendium/spells/summon-lesser-demons-xge.md) spell, you may expend this item instead of its usual material component. If you do, the CR limits of the summoned demons specified in the spell are doubled. | 4 gp | 12 lb | â€” |
