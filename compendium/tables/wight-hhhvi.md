| 10 | Wight Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a wight is a black congealed mess, however it carries strong traces of necrotic energy. This energy reacts strangely with living creatures, granting them interesting abilities, but at a cost.<br /><br />**Use.** If you drink this vial of blood, for the next 24 hours you gain [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to 60 ft., as well as the ability to see the life spark of all living things. This life spark appears as a white hot aura around a creature's body and is visible even through [invisibility](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), and opaque cover no more than 2 feet thick. While able to see this spark, you have advantage on any Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to find living creatures. However, if you are in sunlight, you also have disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. Also, you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have your hit point maximum reduced by `dice:1d6+2\|noform\|avg` (`1d6+2`) until you finish a long rest. You die if this causes your hit point maximum to be reduced below 0 and then rise again 24 hours later as a wandering [zombie](compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) unless your body is destroyed or you are restored to life. | 5 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Wight Hand | The touch of a wight is known for its life-draining ability. Even after its soul has finally left it, a wight's body is permanently altered by the dark forces that reanimated it. All it takes is for another spark of necrotic energy to restore it to a usable state. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [Hand of Undeath](compendium/items/hand-of-undeath-hhhvi.md) |
