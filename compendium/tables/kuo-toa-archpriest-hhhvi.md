# Kuo-Toa Archpriest
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 71* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Kuo-Toa Teeth (small pouch) | The bite of a kuo-toa is not particularly deadly to anything larger than a river fish. Their unique shape however lends them well to doubling as fishing hooks, and many anglers swear that their yields increase when using kuo-toa hooks. | 8 cp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Kuo-Toa Skin | Kuo-toa skin is notoriously slippery, owing to a mucus that the kuo-toa produces at all times. Soaking a fresh skin in this mucus helps to create a waterproof, if disgusting, tarp. | 1 sp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Kuo-Toa Archpriest Brain | A kuo-toa archpriest's brain has become noticeably more mutated that allows it to both use and bestow spells upon others. This unique brain is both more fragile than a regular kuo-toa's but also more useful in alchemy. | 3 gp | 2 lb | [Potion of Magical Madness](compendium/items/potion-of-magical-madness-hhhvi.md) |
