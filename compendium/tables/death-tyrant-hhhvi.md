*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 13* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Death Tyrant Jaw | The teeth of a beholder must never be underestimated, even in death. Their jaws possess a wicked bite, and when attached to the handle of an axe, so can your backswing. | 700 gp | 20 lb | [+2 Greataxe](compendium/items/2-weapon.md) |
| 25 | Death Tyrant Eye | The eye of a beholder undergoes a terrible transformation when it transitions into undeath, emitting a cone of negative energy rather than anti-magic. But like a normal beholder eye, this eye can be transformed into a crystal of great power that many powerful wizards enjoy employing in their lairs. | 3,500 gp | 20 lb | [Negative Energy Crystal](compendium/items/negative-energy-crystal-hhhvi.md) |
