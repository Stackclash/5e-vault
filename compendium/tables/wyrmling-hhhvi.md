| 10 | Dragon Flesh | Despite common misconception, dragon flesh does not contain any magical benefit. It does however contain many culinary benefits. The exact flavour differs depending on the type of dragon it was taken from, but anybody that has eaten a dragon steak claims that it puts even the most exquisite aged beef to shame. There are many royal cooks and larders that would pay a high sum for just a pound of this delicacy. | 3 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 20 | [Type] Dragon Breath Pouch | **.** When the word "dragon" is uttered, people tend to think of three things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces. While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ depending on the dragon, they all share the same destructive results. Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction.<br /><br />**Use.** May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the primary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type and DC, the damage type, and the damage amount are identical to the breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from. | 160 gp | 7 lb | [Dragon's Wrath](compendium/items/dragons-wrath-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | [Type] Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch (Metallic Dragons only) | **.** The metallic dragons are considered to be less violent than their chromatic cousins and this is reflected in their alternate breath weapons. While their primary breath weapons mimic those of the chromatics, all metallics dragons wield a secondary, much less harmful breath weapon. This too can be harvested and used for similar purposes as the primary dragon breath pouch.<br /><br />**Use.** May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the secondary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type, DC, and the effect are identical to the secondary breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from. | 160 gp | 7 lb | [Dragon's Mercy](compendium/items/dragons-mercy-hhhvi.md) |
