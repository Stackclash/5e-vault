| 10 | Lock of Hill Giant Hair | Resembling the brush on the top of a barren hill, the hair of a hill giant is considered a valuable resource to leatherworkers. The hair of a hill giant, while unpleasant to the touch, makes for a good rope material and even the hill giants themselves use it to stitch their clothes together. | 20 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Hill Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the hill giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [Potion of Hill Giant Strength](compendium/items/potion-of-hill-giant-strength.md) |
