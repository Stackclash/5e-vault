| 5 | Oinoloth Ichor (vial) | Even a casual whiff of this ichor would inform you that it is not safe for humanoid consumption; it reeks of decomposition, decay, and death. Despite this, it does actually have many benefits that can restore a body's vitality instantly. However, as with everything involving a yugoloth, doing so comes with a price. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** You may drink this potion as an action. If you do so, you instantly regain all hit points and you end one disease or condition from yourself from a choice of: [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). You then gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion), and your hit point maximum is reduced by `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`). This reduction can be removed only by a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell or by the [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell being cast on you three times within the same hour. You die if your hit point maximum is reduced to 0. | 150 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Oinoloth Plague Pustule (×3) | Undulating and pulsating even after removal, these pustules contain concentrated doses of the oinoloth's plagues and it is common to see them prick these open as they spread their invisible death. A very steady hand needs to handle these, but afterwards, they can be thrown at one's enemies as disease bombs.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw this pustule at a space within 20 feet of you, blighting the area within 10 feet of that spot similar to the bringer of plagues ability of the [oinoloth](compendium/bestiary/fiend/oinoloth-mpmm.md) [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (your DM has the stats)]. | 95 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Oinoloth Claw (×2) | The claws of an oinoloth are fascinating structures, resembling syringes more than actual nails. These sharp, hollow tubes allow the oinoloth to deliver virulent payloads to their foes. With a little bit of adjustment, these claws can make a deadly pair of gloves that can bring both fast and slow deaths to one's opponent. | 300 gp | 8 lb | [Gloves of Pestilence](compendium/items/gloves-of-pestilence-hhhviii.md) |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | Gem of Teleportation |
