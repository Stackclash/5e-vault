# Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 56* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gnoll Tooth (small pouch) | The sharp, irregular teeth of a gnoll. Not worth much other than as a trophy. Harvesters are advised to wash them at the first chance, as they carry the stench of a gnoll's mouth long after removal. | 1 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Mark of Yeenoghu | As an homage to their demonic overlord, particularly zealous gnolls paint themselves with the mark of Yeenoghu using the blood of their victims. The brands have little of their intended effect of making the gnoll invulnerable, but mostly just due to the gnoll's own incompetence. The marks themselves actually do possess a degree of magic that demonologists value as a research material and component. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Demon Gnoll Heart | After a fang of Yeenoghu is killed, the demonic spirit that empowered it leaves. However, its corrupting touch lingers on the corpse long after its death. This is most obvious in the heart of a slain fang of Yeenoghu which continues to drip a drool-like ichor even after removal from the body. | 10 gp | 2 lb | [Yeenoghu's Boon](compendium/items/yeenoghus-boon-hhhvi.md) |
