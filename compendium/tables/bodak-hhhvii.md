# Bodak
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 10* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Mark of Orcus | The infamous mace and skull symbol of [Orcus](compendium/bestiary/npc/orcus-mpmm.md) is carved into every bodak's chest, regardless of their origin. These blasphemous symbols maintain a strong connection to [Orcus](compendium/bestiary/npc/orcus-mpmm.md) even after the defeat of its bodak, and there are techniques to use them to channel the demon lord's power for dark and powerful curses. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [Curse of Desolation](compendium/items/curse-of-desolation-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Bodak Eye (Ã—2) | Pure white, blank and incredibly disturbing. Filled with the unholy, necrotic energies of the demon prince [Orcus](compendium/bestiary/npc/orcus-mpmm.md), these eyes can be worked upon by a talented thaumaturge to create a rather morbid set of goggles that allow the wielder to literally see death wherever they look. | 70 gp | 1 lb | [Death Goggles](compendium/items/death-goggles-hhhvii.md) |
