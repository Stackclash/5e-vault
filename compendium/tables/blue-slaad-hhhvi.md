# Blue Slaad
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 95* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Slaad Slime (vial) | The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers. | 3 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Slaad Heart | Slaadi are creatures of pure chaos, born from the unstable energies in Limbo. As such, their very bodies disrupt the natural order of things and those that consume some of their flesh tend to find that probability itself changes for them, if only temporarily. Beware however, as the universe is not to be trifled with, and it tends to find ways to balance itself out later.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may eat this item. If you do so, then once within the next 10 minutes you may choose to bend the laws of fate within your favour. If you do so, you gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If you choose not to, this item is wasted. After those 10 minutes have passed, your DM may choose at any time within the next 24 hours to impose disadvantage on 1 attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make. | 30 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Blue Slaad Claw (×2) | The hooked claws of a blue slaad contain wicked hooks that dig into flesh and act as vectors for the transmission of the dreaded "chaos phage." This disease does not live long after the death of its slaad host, however that does not still mean that it cannot be used in nefarious artificing to create a weapon of even deadlier design. | 100 gp | 15 lb | [Sickle of Chaos](compendium/items/sickle-of-chaos-hhhvi.md) |
