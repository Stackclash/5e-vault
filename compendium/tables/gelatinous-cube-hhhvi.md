| 10 | Gelatinous Residue (vial) | The gelatinous residue from a gelatinous cube carries much of the same acidic properties from its original form. Unlike samples taken from other oozes, the gelatinous cube's acid is difficult to identify when mixed with other liquids, making it the substance of choice among assassins with a subtler touch. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** Drinking the gelatinous residue automatically deals `dice:6d6\|noform\|avg` (`6d6`) acid damage to the drinker. The gelatinous residue may be mixed with up to 5 oz. of other liquid and still retain this property. A DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check can identify a liquid that has had gelatinous residue mixed into it. | 7 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
