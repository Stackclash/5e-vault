| 5 | Abyssal Weapon Ichor (6 vials) | It is the nightmare of every crusading adventurer to slay a powerful foe, only to find their hard won loot disappear before their very eyes. Such is the case with the molydeus, who in a final act of spite to its enemies, causes its weapon to dissolve into a thick ichor upon its death. Although this was intended as a safeguard by the demon lords, they did not anticipate the resourcefulness of a harvester armed with this book! Simply scoop up some of that ichor into an [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md) and bring it back to a very skilled alchemist to create a weapon oil that will add a demonic lethality to your strikes. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).** | 300 gp | 5 lb | [Abyssal Oil](compendium/items/abyssal-oil-hhhviii.md) |
| 10 | Molydeus Snake Head | The molydeus snake head has an inherent connection to the demon lord that molded the molydeus and acts as both an advisor and supervisor to the mighty fiend. Aside from that, they also possess a potent venom that corrupts the very lifeforce of a creature and over time, transforms them into a demon themselves. It takes a powerful thaumaturge to tame the demonic connection inside the head, but if managed, it can allow the wielder to channel the strength of the demon lords themselves. | 2,470 gp | 30 lb | Staff of the Demon Tongue |
| 15 | Molydeus Wolf Head | The main head of the molydeus resembles that of a savage wolf, with teeth sharper than daggers and a constant rabid gleam in their eyes. It is believed that these wolf heads are actually themselves harvested in the Abyss by trapping dozens of starved wolves in a pit and having them tear each other to shreds in a cannibalistic frenzy; the last one alive has the dubious honor of becoming a part of the new molydeus. | 2,470 gp | 45 lb | Helm of Demon's Wrath |
| 20 | Demon Lord's Authority | Much like a well-trusted valet, the existence of a molydeus is one of both servitude and authority. While they must obey their demon lord's every whim, they are also feared as carrying the voice of their master everywhere they go and as such, they are one of the few beings in existence that can inspire fear in a demon. This fear creates a gestalt field around the molydeus that in turn inspires more obsequience from lesser demons in a self-perpetuating cycle. It is unorthodox to do this, but using [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md), a very skilled harvester can trap this energy to be later vested into a most powerful helm. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 18,000 gp | 1 lb | Helm of Abyssal Domination |
