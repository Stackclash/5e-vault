| 15 | Troglodyte Hide | Troglodyte hides are capable of changing colours to match their surroundings, allowing them to create ambushes on those less wary. While the camouflage ability is impressive, it loses much of this capability once removed from the troglodyte, and the hide itself makes for a poor armor. As such, it is often used only as a camouflage blanket used to disguise things from only very far away. Alternatively, the hides have been ground down and made into an ink that matches the colour of the parchment it is written on, allowing for the creation of secret messages revealed only under certain lights. | 8 sp | 25 lb | â€” |
