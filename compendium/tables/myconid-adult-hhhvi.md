# Myconid Adult
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 78* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Rapport Spores (small pouch) | This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had uses of its rapport spores ability. These spores have a unique ability to transmit thought between the myconid and other intelligent beings. With some reverse engineering, alchemists have managed to use these spores to create a potion that simulates a similar effect in other creatures. | 5 sp | 1 lb | [Potion of Rapport](compendium/items/potion-of-rapport-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Pacifying Spores (small pouch) | **.** This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of its pacifying spores ability. The pacifying spores of an adult myconid are capable of stopping even the largest of creatures, if at least temporarily. Stored properly, they can be packed into small clusters and used in much the same manner as their original owner used them.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack and throw the pouch of pacifying spores at a target within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 9 sp | 1 lb | â€” |
