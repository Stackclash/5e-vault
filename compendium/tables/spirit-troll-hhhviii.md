| 10 | Trolloplasm (5 vials) | Even though their bodies have since become incorporeal and intangible, a spirit troll still somehow manages to leave an unholy amount of muck and grime in its wake. This strange, sticky substance has been dubbed "trollo-plasm", and carries many of the same properties that troll blood had during its life. As such, it can be used for the ubiquitous [potion of healing](compendium/items/potion-of-healing-gv.md). | 65 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Greater Healing](compendium/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) |
| 15 | Essence of Troll | When trolls are properly vanquished, their souls are forfeit to their god Varpak for devouring. However, since a spirit troll is entirely formed of soul, and since Varpak is apparently a messy eater, some trace amounts remain behind which can be trapped in [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md) and reused for later. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 575 gp | 1 lb | [Amulet of the Spirit Hunter](compendium/items/amulet-of-the-spirit-hunter-hhhviii.md) |
