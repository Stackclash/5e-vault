| 10 | Nupperibo Blubber (5 vials) | Due to their unique physiology, the nupperibo doesn't actually expend energy when it moves. As such, they never shed any fat, despite their tendency to traverse long distances to consume only a tiny morsel of food. This fat builds and compounds over time, creating a dense blubber that can be rendered into a candle tallow that burns infinitely longer than their mundane counterparts. That said, these candles have not entered popular usage due to their nauseating stench, but they can be found lining the walls of many evil lairs and being used by creatures for whom the odor is not a problem. | 1 sp | 1 lb | [Long-lasting Candle](compendium/items/long-lasting-candle-hhhviii.md) |
