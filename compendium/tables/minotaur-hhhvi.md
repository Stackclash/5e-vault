# Minotaur
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 76* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Minotaur Hide | A minotaur resembles cattle in every way that counts. Taking their hides and tanning them into leather is no more distasteful than doing so to an ordinary bull. | 4 gp | 25 lb | [+1 Studded Leather Armor](compendium/items/1-armor.md) |
| 10 | Minotaur Heart | The heart of a minotaur is far larger and stronger than a human's or a bull's. Warped by the dark influence of [Baphomet](compendium/bestiary/npc/baphomet-mpmm.md), this heart carries strong magic that can be brought out by a talented artificer. | 10 gp | 4 lb | [Minotaur Compass](compendium/items/minotaur-compass-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Minotaur Horn (Ã—2) | The wicked horns of the minotaur have ended more than one hapless adventurer's life. When mounted on a sturdy helm, and with slight magical reinforcement, a wearer can emulate the deadly charge of the horns' original owner. | 10 gp | 20 lb | [Helm of the Minotaur](compendium/items/helm-of-the-minotaur-hhhvi.md) |
