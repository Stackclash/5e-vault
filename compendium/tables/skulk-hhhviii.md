| 10 | Shadow Visage | A skulk is a pitiful figure, a creature that has lost all sense of identity due to its endless wandering through the Shadowfell. The effects of this is so intense that they even lose their physical features, becoming virtually indistinguishable from a mannequin or dummy. If their blank faces are removed carefully, they can be repurposed as a magical mask that will also help hide your own identity from those gazing at you (mostly just because it covers your face). | 1 gp | 1 lb | [Vacant Mask](compendium/items/vacant-mask-hhhviii.md) |
