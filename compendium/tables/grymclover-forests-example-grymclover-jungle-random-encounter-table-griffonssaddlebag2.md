*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 279* 

`dice: [](grymclover-forests-example-grymclover-jungle-random-encounter-table-griffonssaddlebag2.md#^2-encounter)`

| dice: 2d12 | Encounter |
|------------|-----------|
| 2 | An arch of slowly-shifting brambles that acts as a gateway to the plane of the Fey (50%) or the plane of Shadow (50%) during a waxing crescent moon or new moon, respectively. |
| 3–4 | A grymhare (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) innocently lying in a stray sunbeam to lure in unwary prey. |
| 5–6 | A circle of `dice:4d4\|noform\|avg` (`4d4`) [druids](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) that are developing a ritual to channel (75%) or cleanse (25%) the Grymclover Forest's corruption. |
| 7–8 | `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`) [gray oozes](compendium/bestiary/ooze/gray-ooze.md) (45%), `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) [ochre jellies](compendium/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md) (35%), or `dice:1d3\|noform\|avg` (`1d3`) [black puddings](compendium/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md) (20%) milling about aimlessly. |
| 9–10 | `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) corrupted, predatory beasts (60%) native to the region, such as bears or [wolves](compendium/bestiary/beast/wolf.md), or corrupted dinosaurs (40%) like [triceratops](compendium/bestiary/beast/triceratops.md) or [tyrannosaurus rex](compendium/bestiary/beast/tyrannosaurus-rex.md) (see [Corrupted Creatures](compendium/tables/grymclover-forests-corrupted-creatures-griffonssaddlebag2.md) sidebar above). |
| 11–13 | The brambles of the forest encircle the party to impede travel. Each character must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage and gain one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) from the constricting vegetation. |
| 14–15 | `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`) bramble creepers (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) or `dice:2d8\|noform\|avg` (`2d8`) archer flowers (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) patiently waiting in ambush. |
| 16–17 | `dice:3d4\|noform\|avg` (`3d4`) [awakened shrubs](compendium/bestiary/plant/awakened-shrub.md) (40%), `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`) [awakened trees](compendium/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md) (30%), or `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) [shambling mounds](compendium/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) (30%) originally made from the forest's natural plant life, but now corrupted by the forest's choking brambles. |
| 18–19 | `dice:2d12\|noform\|avg` (`2d12`) psybirds (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) or `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) cloverback toads (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) stirring up mist and fog with their movements. |
| 20–21 | A grym-mage tyrannosaur (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) or `dice:1d8\|noform\|avg` (`1d8`) cyglops (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) hunting and scavenging, respectively. |
| 22–23 | The swirling mists thicken and grow acidic for the next `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) hours. At the end of each hour, a character must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:4d8\|noform\|avg` (`4d8`) acid damage unless they are protected by shelters such as a tent, building, or another fog-proof barrier. |
| 24 | An unexpected dungeon or ruin (see [Example Dungeons Table](compendium/tables/grymclover-forests-example-dungeons-table-griffonssaddlebag2.md)) that is younger than the forest's corruption (80%) or is the origin of it (20%). |
