# Nagpa
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 53* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Nagpa Claw | Unlike most humanoids who are capable of building wonders with their hands, the sharp, gnarled claws of a nagpa are fit for only one purpose: destruction. Indeed, the magic that they emit from their claws never seem to involve building anything or transfiguring one thing into something better; it always seems to involve death and decay. The nagpas have become so good at this that they even developed their natural magic in one of their claws that disrupts and paralyzes the life functions of all creatures around them. When incorporated into a staff, this claw can channel the nefarious powers of a nagpa for all sorts of dark abilities. | 600 gp | 2 lb | [Staff of Maleficence](compendium/items/staff-of-maleficence-hhhviii.md) |
| 15 | Nagpa Heart | **.** The heart of a nagpa resembles the rest of its body: shriveled and twisted. In fact, their hearts are so corrupted that they are able to spread their taint to the hearts of others, bringing them under their dark sway. While it does take some skill to harvest this fragile organ without destroying it, the heart serves as a powerful charm for any spellcaster looking to enhance their own bewitching talents.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding this item, if you [cast a spell](/compendium/rules/actions.md#cast%20a%20spell) that would result in a creature becoming [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you, you may double both the range of the spell and its duration. Once used, this item may not be used again until the next dawn. | 1,800 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Brand of the Raven Queen | **.** When the Raven Queen cursed the craven wizards that would become the nagpas, she branded her mark on their very souls, condemning them to long lives of torment and punishment for their deeds. Once the nagpa has finally been relieved of its mortal coil, this brand can be transferred to a sheet of [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md) in an extremely difficult ritual. After being secured, the brand serves as a connection to the Raven Queen and can bestow on its owner a single one of her blessings...or curses depending on your outlook on things. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** If you die while this item is on your person, you may choose to have your soul re-enter your body immediately, bringing you back to life, fixing any mortal wounds, and restoring your hit points to half their maximum. If you are resurrected in this way however, the visual marks of the cause of your death remain permanently scarred on your body, even if such marks would seemingly make it impossible for you to still be functioning. For example, if you died via fire, you would permanently bear grievous burn marks all over your body, or if you died via bludgeoning, your face would look permanently bruised and swollen. This item cannot be used if you died in a manner that would also cause your soul to be destroyed or trapped somewhere else. | 4,600 gp | 1 lb | — |
