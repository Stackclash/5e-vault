# Dragon, Shadow
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 33* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Shadowflame Ember (3 vials) | After death, a shadow dragon's "flame" quickly snuffs itself out, dissolving into the shadows around it. If one is quick however, they can capture an ember in an enchanted vial to be used for later. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).** | 140 gp | 1 lb | [Shadowflame Oil](compendium/items/shadowflame-oil-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | Shadow Dragon Scale (large bag) (only harvestable from dragon's that have progressed beyond the wyrmling stage) | The scales of the shadow dragon are a curious colour that can only be described as the colour of a shadow at dusk. Despite their ethereal appearance however, they maintain their incredible durability and strength. If forged into a suit of armor, it can make even the bulkiest of knights disappear when in darkness. | 1,000 gp | 60 lb | [Dusk Armor](compendium/items/dusk-armor-hhhvi.md) |
| 25 | Shadow Dragon Wing (Ã—2) (only harvestable from adult and ancient dragons) | The ever shifting wings of the shadow dragon make it appear more like a dark cloud when it swoops upon its prey. They are more fragile than regular dragon wings and require great care when harvested, however these same special properties make them invaluable when crafting implements of flight and stealth. | 1,500 gp | 50 lb | [Shadow Wing Cape](compendium/items/shadow-wing-cape-hhhvi.md) |
