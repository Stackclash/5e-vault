| 15 | Mark of the Depths | **.** Despite the fact that a deep scion reverts to its original form upon its death, there is still a mark of its dark patron that lingers for a moment before vanishing into the aether. A quick application of [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md) can trap this essence and reuse it for later, hopefully for more altruistic purposes. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to tear this item in half. If you do so, all creatures within 300 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of your next turn. In addition, any creature that succeeds on the saving throw gains the memories of the last 24 hours of the deep scion from whom this item was harvested. | 45 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
