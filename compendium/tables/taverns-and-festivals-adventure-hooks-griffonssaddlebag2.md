|----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | After a celebratory night in the local tavern, the party discovers that the building has been transported `dice:5d20\|noform\|avg` (`5d20`) miles away, trading spots with a different tavern. If the magic responsible can be identified, perhaps it can be reversed. | At the end of a day at a carnival, the party learns that the circus tent, including the people and creatures inside it, has mysteriously vanished. The party is asked to recover them and help ensure that the show can go on. |
| 2 | The party's favorite tavern has no alcohol to serve, as their entire stock has vanished. The business may be forced to close if the barrels are not recovered. | The conflict between two of the festival's performers is driving away business. Since they won't explain the feud, the owner asks the players to help resolve the disagreement instead. |
| 3 | As part of a promotional event, the bartender has hidden numerous bar coasters all around town and is offering a night of free drinks to whoever finds the most. | After winning a stuffed festival prize and then losing it in the crowds, a crying child asks the party for help finding it. |
| 4 | The owner can only offer a single room for the party because one of the last travelers to rent a room vanished without returning their key. If it can be found and returned, the owner offers both rooms free for 3 nights. | Amidst the festivities, the festival's cartpulling oxen have been lost. The host offers free admittance and a piece of free magical food for each party member if they are returned. |
| 5 | The establishment's tables and chairs have succumbed to a drunken brawl, so the owner is hiring adventurers to bring the town's carpenter high quality wood so that replacement furniture can be made. However, the only nearby source of lumber is in a nearby forest that's said to be haunted. | The festival hunting contest appears to be more difficult than ever, as the hunting woods have become inexplicably barren of game. Before it's postponed, the huntmaster requests adventurers venture into the woods to see why the wildlife are avoiding the area. |
| 6 | The city's most popular storyteller, a wizened old bard, is refusing to perform in the city's taverns. None of the owners understand why the performer is ignoring them, and tensions between the businesses are rising. | The festival's jousting event threatens to be canceled due to the disappearance of the local ferrier. Most contestants suspect foul play, with the heaviest suspicion being placed upon the current champion. |
