# Draegloth
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 17* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Draegloth Claw (×2) | The long claws of a draegloth are deformed, monstrous versions of their drow arms. Useless for anything except tearing through flesh, they in turn make wonderful crafting components for stronger weapons. It is something of a custom for drow to use such weapons as a spiteful punishment against a family that has sent a draegloth against them, which is the origin of the Underdark payback idiom, *"to give someone the draegloth claw."* | 11 gp | 20 lb | Any +1 melee piercing or slashing weapon |
| 15 | Draegloth Heart | **.** Similar to a drow heart that has been touched by Lolth, the heart of a draegloth carries a strong connection to the Abyss and may act as a conduit to summon forth more demons from that infernal plane.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to stab this heart. If you do so, you summon forth a [glabrezu](compendium/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu.md) as if you had cast the [summon greater demon](compendium/spells/summon-greater-demon-xge.md) spell at 9th level. Once this ability has been used once, the heart withers away and become useless. | 30 gp | 4 lb | — |
| 20 | Mark of Lolth | As gifts from Lolth, draegloths carry her dark brand on them somewhere on their bodies, similar to high priestesses of the Spider Queen. If harvested and preserved properly, its powers can be transferred to an amulet that can channel the Spider Goddess' powers, whether she likes it or not. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [Drow Amulet](compendium/items/drow-amulet-hhhvi.md) |
