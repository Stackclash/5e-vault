| 5 | Black Blood (3 vials) | As a spiritual entity, many would assume that wraiths do not have blood, and in most definitions they would be correct. The "blood" to be harvested from a sword wraith is actually a congealed ooze that drips in their wake from their phantom wounds; a constant reminder of their abrupt deaths and lost chance of glory. Running this blood through a crucible can provide some of the important components for the useful [potion of heroism](compendium/items/potion-of-heroism.md). | 7 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Heroism](compendium/items/potion-of-heroism.md) |
| 10 | Lost Valor | Like many spirits, the sword wraith is bound to the plane of its death by feelings of regret and unfinished business. In the sword wraith's case, this is their rage at the loss of their chance to win glory in battle. This rage consumes them and fuels both their incorporeal form and their reckless battle tactics. If captured in [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md), it can be embodied inside the wielder, granting them the same bravery and deathless zeal at the cost of some tactical sensibility. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, causing you to become embodied by the lost valor for the next hour. While embodied, you cannot take the [Hide](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) action, but you also cannot be [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed immediately, you may roll a `dice:d20\|noform\|avg` (`d20`). On an 11 or higher, you instantly regain 1 hit point. | 20 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Commander's Mark | A true commander feels the pain of the soldiers under their command; as such, you can imagine that it is incredibly painful for them to feel the crushing regret of their entire army dying in vain. A sword wraith commander's feelings of helpless responsibility often manifest themselves into tangible tokens that represent their damaged sense of authority: a dented badge, a torn flag, etc. These marks are highly prized for their strong emotional resonance and can easily be repurposed into useful magical items, or simply sold as morbidly curious trinkets. | 355 gp | 3 lb | [Boon of the Wraith Leader](compendium/items/boon-of-the-wraith-leader-hhhviii.md) |
