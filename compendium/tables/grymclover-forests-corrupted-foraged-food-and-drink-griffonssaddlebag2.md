# Grymclover Forests; Corrupted Foraged Food and Drink
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 278* 

The adverse effects that cause a grymclover forest to emerge provide additional danger by corrupting sources of clean water and food. A foraging character makes a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. There's a 50 percent chance that any food or water found in these forests has been corrupted. A DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check or [detect poison and disease](compendium/spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md) spell reveals if any foraged food or water has been corrupted. A creature that ingests corrupted food or water in this way must roll on the Corrupted Foraged Food and Drink table.
