`dice: [](bloodmire-diseases-griffonssaddlebag2.md#^2-disease)`

| dice: 2d8 | Disease |
|-----------|---------|
| 2–3 | Bloodburnt Rash: At the start of each of your turns when you are not under the bloodwater, you take `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage. This disease lasts until you take fire damage equal to half your hit point maximum in this way. |
| 4–8 | Crimson Sight: Your eyes become bloodshot, your pupils dilate, and your senses of safety and danger become twisted. Whenever you see a fey or humanoid, flip a coin. If it's heads, you consider that creature to be a friendly acquaintance. If it's tails, you consider the creature to be a hostile enemy. You consider any fiend or fiendish villager to be a friendly acquaintance, even if it's under the effect of illusory magic. This disease lasts until you finish a long rest. |
| 9–15 | Rusting Flesh: Sometimes called the Iron Curse, this disease causes your flesh to corrode and slough off. You take `dice:1d8\|noform\|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage and your maximum hit points are reduced by the same amount each day at dusk. If your hit point maximum drops to 0 in this way, you die. This disease lasts until 7 days have passed. |
| 16 | Blood Lunacy: A rare and weakened form of lycanthropy. You suffer disadvantage on saving throws against contracting lycanthropy. Your hair begins to grow long and thick, and you gain no benefit from finishing a short or long rest during a full moon. This disease lasts until it's cured by magical means. |
