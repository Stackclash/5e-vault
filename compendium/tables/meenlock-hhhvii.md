| 10 | Meenlock Claw (×2) | The meenlock claw is known for its ability to paralyze the creatures that it strikes. Unfortunately, it loses much of its magical potency upon its death and is capable of inflicting nothing more than a slight numbing sensation. Ironically, these claws have been repurposed by Feywild inhabitants as herding rods to calm over-agitated livestock. | 1 gp | 3 lb | — |
| 15 | Meenlock Head | Resembling an overgrown ant head, a meenlock's head is truly something to behold. Other than its use as a wonderful wall ornament, it can be hollowed out and used as a helmet with limited forms of some of the meenlock's abilities.<br /><br />**Use.** When you make a Charisma ([Intimidation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check while holding this head, you may choose to do so at advantage. Once this ability has been used 5 times, the head loses all magic and becomes worthless. | 4 gp | 6 lb | [Tormentor's Cap](compendium/items/tormentors-cap-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Meenlock Spirit | A meenlock is a being born out of emotion, and this emotion can be harvested with a quick application of [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md). Hags in particular are fond of harvesting meenlocks for their spirits in order to craft insidious curses. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 12 gp | 1 lb | [Curse of Never-Ending Fear](compendium/items/curse-of-never-ending-fear-hhhvii.md) |
