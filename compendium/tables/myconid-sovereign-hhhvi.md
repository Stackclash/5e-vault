# Myconid Sovereign
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 78* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Rapport Spores (small pouch) | This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had uses of its rapport spores ability. These spores have a unique ability to transmit thought between the myconid and other intelligent beings. With some reverse engineering, alchemists have managed to use these spores to create a potion that simulates a similar effect in other creatures. | 5 sp | 1 lb | [Potion of Rapport](compendium/items/potion-of-rapport-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Pacifying Spores (small pouch) | **.** This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of its pacifying spores ability. The pacifying spores of an adult myconid are capable of stopping even the largest of creatures, if at least temporarily. Stored properly, they can be packed into small clusters and used in much the same manner as their original owner used them.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack and throw the pouch of pacifying spores at a target within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 9 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Hallucination Spores (small pouch) | **.** The hallucination spores created by the myconid sovereign create a strong psychedelic effect in any creature that inhales them. Imbibers have described visions of strong lights and strange images, and an overall satisfied feeling afterwards. Underdark societies are known to hunt sovereigns down just for these spores, which is a shame because most would happily share the spores to any visitor who just asked politely.<br /><br />**Use.** You may make a ranged weapon attack at a creature within 10 feet by throwing the pouch at them. Upon a successful hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 25 | Animating Spores (small pouch) | **.** This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of its animating spores ability. The animating spores of a myconid sovereign holds a strange place between schools of magic. Holding characteristics of necromantic, enchantment, and transfiguration, these spores continue to vex even the foremost scholars of the day.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may sprinkle these spores over the corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (refer to the Monster Manual for the statblock)]. The corpse stays animated for `dice: 1d4+1\|avg` (`1d4+1`) weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
