| dice: d6 | Example Dungeon |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Hidden and carefully guarded under the bloodwater of a Crimson Legion village is an alchemical laboratory that contains a stockpile of broken fey orbs. Careful investigation could reveal the history of these orbs as well as a way to disable them. |
| 2 | A once-prominent fortress built by Syre and his warriors is now almost completely destroyed by plantlife, mud, and bloodwater. The sturdy yet sunken walls are now home to a variety of monstrous amphibians, reptiles, and other beasts. Perhaps some carved hints about the Bloodmire's origin or ancient artifacts could be salvaged. |
| 3 | High in the canopy, a large number of giant mosquitoes have made a strange hive that's reminiscent of a wasp's nest. Local refugees weren't concerned about the hive until the insects started abducting children and small adults. They suspect that the people stolen are being used to build, or possibly feed, something deep within the hive's tunnels. |
| 4 | One of the very few intact fey portals leads to Syre's hidden demiplane: a tower filled with magical traps, libraries, and fey heirlooms. Whether led there by sprites or found by chance, only the bravest adventurers would be capable of journeying to the end to find the mysterious treasure Syre left behind. However, even the few remaining sprites can't remember what it might be. |
| 5 | A fey portal has become corrupted by the Bloodmire's curses. Each new moon, the portal sparks to life and allows travel to a realm full of shades, dark magic, and terrors of the night. While it's open, this portal allows these strange nightmares to leak out and terrorize the swamp's inhabitants with otherworldly monsters. Unless someone can find a way to close the portal, the Bloodmire may fall completely under its sway. |
| 6 | Rumor tells that a group of bandits have amassed a hoard of treasure somewhere in the Bloodmire that's filled with gold, goods, and supplies stolen from merchants who were careless or desperate enough to travel through the swamp unprotected. |
