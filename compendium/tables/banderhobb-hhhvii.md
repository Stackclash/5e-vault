# Banderhobb
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 8* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Banderhobb Goo (vial) | **.** One half of the disgusting components that constitute a banderhobb's vile form is the rendered flesh of various swamp creatures. When the banderhobb expires, this flesh loses any sense of cohesion and breaks down into a fetid goo. This goo still holds some mutagenic properties when harvested correctly, but care should be used when applying it to anything.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to pour the contents of this vial onto a lizard, snake, toad, or frog that is no larger than Medium sized. That creature immediately grows into the giant version of itself (as described in the "Monster Manual") for 1 hour. It returns to its normal size at the end of the hour, or if it drops to 0 hit points. While under the effect of this item, the creature becomes violent and attempts to attack the nearest creature it can see whenever possible. | 25 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Liquid Shadow (vial) | **.** The other half of the components of a banderhobb is liquid shadow, siphoned from a dark realm like the Shadowfell or Underdark. It shifts constantly in its vial and no amount of light seems to be able to disperse it. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to pour the contents of this vial over yourself, merging with the shadows within for the next hour. During this time, whenever you are in dim light or darkness, you may take the [Hide](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action, and you may spend an action to teleport, along with whatever you are wearing and carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that you can see. | 65 gp | 1 lb | [Shadow Dye](compendium/items/shadow-dye-hhhvii.md) |
