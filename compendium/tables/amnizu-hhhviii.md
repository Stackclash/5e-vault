| 15 | Amnizu Tooth (×10) | **.** All common folk have heard of the expression: "a devil's smile," or a false grimace that lures the easily susceptible to their doom. The originator of these smiles are the amnizu, possessors of a sharp, wide maw that somehow charms any mortal that gazes upon it, swaying their minds and hearts against their allies. Even after the death and removal from the amnizu, their many fangs possess a lingering of magic that alchemists have taken to grinding into creams and cosmetics that grant the wearer a certain mesmerizing aura.<br /><br />**Use.** When you [cast a spell](/compendium/rules/actions.md#cast%20a%20spell) that would force a creature to succeed on a saving throw or become [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed), you may crush one of the teeth in this pouch to force that creature to make that saving throw at disadvantage. | 80 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Devil Wings (×2) | Like many fiends, the amnizu possesses a pair of wings that grant them flight. And, like many other fiends, these stumpy wings do not rely on physics to carry them aloft, but instead rely on magic. When amputated correctly, they can be transformed into the very useful [infernal wings](compendium/items/infernal-wings-hhhvi.md). | 1,000 gp | 15 lb | [Infernal Wings](compendium/items/infernal-wings-hhhvi.md) > [!note]<br />> probably. |
| 25 | Amnizu Hand | When a [bone devil](compendium/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) is promoted to an amnizu, they are forced into a ritual that involves the painful amputation of their long spindly limbs. In their place, they must grow a new stubby appendage with which they must tear off the rest of their body so that their new amnizu form may grow. The lingering pain of this horrifying process imbues an amnizu's hand with terrible destructive and transformative power which they enjoy displaying on those that defy them. | 6,000 gp | 2 lb | [Wand of Disruption](compendium/items/wand-of-disruption-hhhviii.md) |
| 30 | Amnizu Eye (×2) | Like two cold, distant stars in the pitch black night, the eyes of the amnizu are two pinpricks of light set in dark orbs. These hypnotizing pools of darkness are what allows the amnizu to delve into the hearts and minds of their recruits and transform them into perfect soldiers for the Nine Hells. | 5,000 gp | 1 lb | Mindwipe Lens |
