# Fire Giant Dreadnought
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 21* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lock of Fire Giant Hair | Resembling sparking embers, the hair of a fire giant is considered a valuable resource by blacksmiths. Striking the hairs creates a flame similar to a flint, while burning them creates a hotter flame than is achievable by most other fuels. | 55 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Fire Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the fire giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous [potion of giant strength](compendium/items/potion-of-giant-strength.md). Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 185 gp | 2 lb | [Potion of Fire Giant Strength](compendium/items/potion-of-fire-giant-strength.md) |
| 20 | Fire Giant Heart | Fire giants are known to literally have fire in their veins. One look at their hearts will make that obvious as they continue to spark and smoulder long after removal from their owner's body. Blacksmiths have long known how to transform these hearts into useful lamps. | 500 gp | 5 lb | [Living Lamp](compendium/items/living-lamp-hhhvi.md) |
| 25 | Fire Giant Shield Scrap | The shields of a fire giant dreadnought are much too large for any regular sized adventurer to wield or even transport. Their inner workings however are masterfully crafted and can only be forged by the fire giant's prestigious strength and affinity for flame. These contraptions can be taken to a tinker who most likely will happily accept an opportunity to experiment with such interesting craftwork. | 7,550 gp | 20 lb | [Fire Flash Armor](compendium/items/fire-flash-armor-hhhvii.md) |
