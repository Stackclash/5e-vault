| 10 | Thri-kreen Poison (vial) | **.** The mandibles of a thri-kreen possess a weak venom capable of knocking out weak prey. While usually used solely by thri-kreen for hunting, some of the more enterprising thri-kreen tribes have learned to trade with others by fermenting their venom into an intoxicating brew famous for its pleasant numbing effect.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) this way. The [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 5 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Thri-Kreen Brain (Psionic Thri-Kreen only) | **.** The mind of a thri-kreen is alien enough to most other humanoids, and the mind of one blessed with psionics is even more so. This brain may be tapped to unleash that stored mental energy for a short burst of time.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to eat this brain. If you do so, for the next hour, you gain the ability to cast the [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) spell at will (the hand is [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#invisible)) as well as cast the [blur](compendium/spells/blur.md) spell twice. | 5 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 20 | Thri-Kreen Carapace | Tiny crystal formations inside the hard carapace of the thri-kreen allow it to change colour to camouflage with its surroundings. When travelling paths known for thri-kreen attacks, it is best to be on the lookout for their large eyes which are harder for them to hide than the rest of their body. | 6 gp | 35 lb | [Camouflage Chitin](compendium/items/camouflage-chitin-hhhvi.md) |
