| dice: d10 | Fine Print |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | The deadline for collection of the signee's consideration is significantly sooner than the devil claims. |
| 2 | Excessive use of pronouns. |
| 3 | "Buyer assumes all risks associated with a render of services at the time of delivery including, but not limited to enslavement, beheading, stretching, potentially-disturbing chants, deafness associated with screaming and/or laughter, and a mild burning sensation in sensitive areas." |
| 4 | A line states, "Delivery of offer will be arranged upon receipt of payment," though there is no elaboration on when the goods/services will actually be delivered. |
| 5 | The signature line or another embellishment within the document is actually a line of extremely small text that pledges the signee to a previously unspecified clause. |
| 6 | The benefit conferred upon the character is taken from someone else. |
| 7 | As part of the contract, the signee is required to do something "bi-monthly." This could be interpreted as either twice a month or once every two months, whichever suits the devil drafting the contract. |
| 8 | "Consumption of the is contract results in the nullification of the terms contained therein." |
| 9 | Something is misspelled, possibly changing its meaning. For example, a line may read. "The signee will be granted the Ox of the Dwarvish Lords no less than three (3) days after sealing this agreement." |
| 10 | The contract references a nonexistent section. |
