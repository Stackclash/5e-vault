| 15 | Xvart Tongue | Xvarts are pathetic creatures, possessing little talent or ability. Their one claim of power is their natural affinity for vermin (if one can even call that power) that lets them domesticate those beasts the way other humanoids domesticate cattle. This is helped in part by their tongues which can create the clicks and squeaks that mimic the calls of bats and rats. When taken, stripped, and dried, they can be used as a reed in the pipes of haunting. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [Pipes of Haunting](compendium/items/pipes-of-haunting.md) |
| 20 | Mark of Raxivort | On rare occasions, the craven demigod Raxivort musters enough courage to visit his accursed spawn and take what meagre offerings they have for him. On even rarer occasions, Raxivort will spare some of his power to a follower with the idea that they will bring him more offerings in the future. As befitting of his covetous nature, he brands his mark onto these followers which can then be taken and used for minor spellwork. | 3 gp | 1 lb | [Raxivort's Boon](compendium/items/raxivorts-boon-hhhvii.md) |
