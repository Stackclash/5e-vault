# Taverns and Festivals; NPCs
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 273* 

As hubs of information, quests, and free-flowing drink, taverns and festivals are often chock-full of both curious and common individuals. Each one has a history, a personality, and possibly a task they're grappling with.

You can use the following table to help randomly populate the patrons of a given tavern or festival.

| dice: d20 | NPC |
|-----------|-----|
| 1 | **Emmin Morningsinger** is an older, stoic elf who often keeps himself busy with his work as an alchemist. He comes off cold when giving directions or making requests because he expects the best from everyone around him. |
| 2 | **Nimrielye "Nim" Prylla Ferre** is the bright half-elven leader of the local adventurers guild. Praised from a young age for her leadership skills, she's often the go-to for planning out gatherings. |
| 3 | **Lasiquea Dontia** is an elderly gnomish woman who always greets everyone with a large smile. She runs a small but popular sandwich shop nearby that's especially busy at lunchtime. Forever thinking about her customers, she treats each one of them as if they were her own child. |
| 4 | **Fentrian "Soothe" Jasper** is a half-elven acolyte from a nearby temple. They help treat sick or drunk patrons and only occasionally attempt to give sermons. Generally pleasant, they only become angry when their deity is spoken ill of. |
| 5 | **Gavin Glorychase** is a loud, audacious, and goofy 10-year-old human performer. He shows wisdom beyond his years and has a silver tongue. Despite being seemingly parentless, he appears well off. |
| 6 | **Alx Lonespark** tends to surround himself with more books than people but is often more than willing to help anyone who needs it. The young halfling has shown a spark of magical aptitude, but it never seems to become more than just that: a spark. |
| 7 | **Kaale** is a virtual wall of a dragonborn with an equally intimidating aura about him. He comes across as standoffish and rough, quick to point out mistakes, but also appreciates a job well done. He has a secret appreciation for sweets. |
| 8 | **Remil Twilightmantle** is an older tiefling blacksmith. Her strangely hooved feet and large rounded horns are the results of an old curse, earning her the name of "Ram" from her friends and "Archdevil" from everyone else. She's extremely proud of her smithing skills and enjoys the flames of the forge more than unfamiliar faces. |
| 9 | **Xarthion** is a willowy, green-scaled dragonborn. They speak rarely, but with keen insight into humanoid behaviors and mannerisms. Despite their chromatic ancestry, rumor has it that they've never hurt a soul or been fooled by a lie. |
| 10 | **Malthia Higgenbalm** dreams of studying wizardry but is mostly preoccupied with her tobacco farm. An insatiably curious but perpetually tired halfling, she takes a significant interest in arcane practitioners when she's not dozing in a corner. |
| 11 | **Dannyn Stoutheart** is a dwarf of indeterminate age with a kind smile and immaculate clothing. They rarely drink, but also have a more refined palette. They're always eager to see new adventurers, who often have news of far-off fashion trends. |
| 12 | **Balthuria Coalfist** is a stubborn gnome with a severe distrust of foreigners. Typically covered in oil and other mechanical grime from the day's labors, they are a stalwart friend and ally once won over. As a quiet observer, they have a finger on the pulse of the local trade and marketplace gossip. |
| 13 | **Adiarel Lifesworn** is a female elf that carries a small assortment of plants with her. She shares an oddly close connection to these plants, whose health and color reflect her own temperament. She occasionally offers seeds or clippings to those who earn her trust. |
| 14 | **Sashaa Brightscale** is a female human fisherman renowned by her peers for both work ethic and determination. She has an uncanny sense for knowing where the fish are and what bait they'd respond to on any given day. |
| 15 | **Terrowin Caskbow** is a male human who deals in secrets of all kinds. He is a charismatic fence who is excellent at connecting like-minded people—for a price. He has ties to the local thieves' guild and influence over multiple powerful politicians, but no one knows who. |
| 16 | **Alistaire Greene** is a human farmer with quite the green thumb—metaphorically and literally. They track rich brown dirt wherever they go, but are pleasant company. No one is sure why or how their hands have turned green because the topic is gently, but firmly, avoided. |
| 17 | **Welfrala Heavyhand** is well-known for her brusque responses but seems to save her words for the tavern after a long day in the mines. Once the ale starts being poured, this older dwarf is quick to give thoughtful answers to how her day was. |
| 18 | **Harley** is a tiefling that finds great pleasure in practical jokes and harmless pranks. They are beloved for the entertainment they bring as well as their even-handed distribution of humor. They long to someday find someone crafty enough to successfully out-trick or prank them and become a partner in their antics. |
| 19 | **Rhonas Grout** is a male half-orc mason and provider of quality sculptures and brick-laying. When he relaxes after work, he enjoys strong ale and laughter. Over the years he's accumulated a number of entertaining stories, though he tends to tell them in a roundabout manner. |
| 20 | **Brenton Ashforge** is a quiet human who's often unsure of his own skills, but does his best to meet expectations. It is said he keeps a sketchbook with pages filled with designs of clockwork insects, though he's always denied it exists. |
