# Rakshasa
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 89* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Rakshasa Claw (Ã—2) | The hatred and malice inherent in a rakshasa is embodied in their deformed claws, capable of imparting a curse that spites any it strikes. When burned in an occult ritual, the ashes can create a dye used in dark rituals to curse unwary hoarders of magical items. | 50 gp | 3 lb | [Curse of Nightmares](compendium/items/curse-of-nightmares-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Rakshasa Heart | The rakshasa's tendency to kill and subsume the lives of its victims is almost legendary. The heart of the rakshasa drips with this malicious coveting of others' identities, and can be refashioned into an amulet that allows its wielder to do the same. | 450 gp | 4 lb | [Amulet of the Trickster](compendium/items/amulet-of-the-trickster-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | Rakshasa Hide | While not as potent once removed from its original body, the removed hide of a rakshasa still carries the magical resistance that it is famous for. When reinforced properly, it becomes a fearsome cloak that shrugs off weak spells. | 1,300 gp | 15 lb | [Cloak of Magic Immunity](compendium/items/cloak-of-magic-immunity-hhhvi.md) |
