| 10 | Deva Blood (3 vials) | The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this blood, you regain `dice:4d8+2\|noform\|avg` (`4d8 + 2`) hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness. | 450 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Deva Wing (×2) | There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the silhouette of glorious white angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful [wings of flying](compendium/items/wings-of-flying.md). | 700 gp | 20 lb | [Wings of Flying](compendium/items/wings-of-flying.md) |
| 20 | Deva Skin | The alabaster white skin of a deva gleams in the morning sun, and a single glance of its beauty has been known to turn sinners from their paths of evil. If you are not one of those people however, you may take this skin and use it to simulate some of the miraculous abilities inherent in these angels. | 750 gp | 25 lb | [Angel Robe](compendium/items/angel-robe-hhhvi.md) |
