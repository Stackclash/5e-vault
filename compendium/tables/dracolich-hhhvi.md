| 10 | Dracolich Bone | The process that transforms a dragon carcass into a dracolich does more than simply slough off flesh and skin, it also changes the entire nature of the dragon and suffuses it with an unholy energy that marks it even after the dracolich's spirit is driven off once again. If these bones are taken, ground to a dust and then infused in a magical censer, the user can divine the location of the dracolich's spirit gem and put an end to it once and for all. | 1,000 gp | 20 lb | [Dracolich Censer](compendium/items/dracolich-censer-hhhvi.md) |
