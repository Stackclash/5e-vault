# Oaken Bolter
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 14* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gnome-made Servo | The internal mechanisms of the clockwork constructs can seem almost like magic for anyone not trained in the tinkering and gnomish sciences. While they may vary from model to model (and indeed, even among the same type of clockwork), they all share the same design for the core set of gears that power its lifelike movements. Tinkers of all breeds value these mastercrafted servos to use in their own creations, and will pay a decent price to avoid having to make them on their own. | 1 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Oaken Bolter Bolt (×10) | Despite its superior reinforcement and demonstrable power, the ammunition of an oaken bolter is far too large to be wielded by an ordinary arbalest. That said, fortresses and armies would pay a decent amount to add these bolts to their own armories to be loaded into their ballistae and siege weapons. | 3 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 15 | Oaken Bolter Harpoon | The harpoon of an oaken bolter is of a slightly more sophisticated design than the standard fare wielded by whalers and big-game hunters. The smaller hooks are specially designed to target smaller creatures and are favored by sieging armies for their ability to pull defenders from fortress walls. | 30 gp | 20 lb | — |
| 15 | Oaken Bolter Explosive Core | To aid its destructive capabilities, the oaken bolter is capable of synthesizing an explosive charge on its bolts to deal massive damage to large groups of enemies simultaneously. Although it loses the ability to create new charges once it is detached from the rest of the mechanism, the core still carries one final charge to be detonated once sufficient force is applied.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw this item to a space up to 20 feet away, causing it to explode on impact. Anything within 20 feet of the explosion must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d6\|noform\|avg` (`3d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | 30 gp | 8 lb | — |
| 20 | Oaken Bolter Gear | The system that operates the firing mechanism of the oaken bolter is far more complicated than that of an ordinary crossbow. At the heart of it is a highly specialized piece of gnomish engineering that loads and fires bolts faster and more reliably than humanly possible. Removing the piece is an intricate and delicate process, but tinkers can take a working sample and use it to make a weapon that has the same versatility as that of the original construct. | 70 gp | 8 lb | [Gearstring Launcher](compendium/items/gearstring-launcher-hhhviii.md) |
