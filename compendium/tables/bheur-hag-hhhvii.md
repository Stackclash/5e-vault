# Bheur Hag
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 26* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Bheur Hag Hair (small pouch) | Despite resembling the hoar frost that grows on spider webs, the hair of a bheur hag is surprisingly supple and flexible. Possessing traces of the hag's ancient frost magic, these hairs have been repurposed into strings for various inventions, imparting their wintery power wherever they are used. | 20 gp | 4 lb | [Potion of Corrupted Strength](compendium/items/potion-of-corrupted-strength-hhhvii.md) |
| 10 | Hag Blood (3 vials) | Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease). It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Bheur Hag Skull | Once removed from its taut, frozen flesh, the skull of a bheur hag flashes a constant rictus grin. It stares back at whoever gazes at it, mocking them with thoughts of anxiety and desperation regardless of their current situation. It is dangerous to use in crafting, but when done well, can create an item that oozes with dark magic and the slow of winter. | 40 gp | 10 lb | [Frozen Skull](compendium/items/frozen-skull-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Hag Eyeball | Not to be confused with the notorious "hag eye" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer `dice:3d10\|noform\|avg` (`3d10`) psychic damage and are [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 24 hours. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
