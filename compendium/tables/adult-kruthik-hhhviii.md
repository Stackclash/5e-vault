| 5 | Kruthik Musk (5 vials) | Although kruthiks have their own language consisting of clicks and hisses, they also utilize an alternate form of communication that relies on scent. By leaving scent marks, a kruthik may leave messages and warnings to fellow members of its race. This versatile musk has been adopted for many uses by more civilized races including perfumes, alcohols, and (ironically) insect repellants. | 2 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Kruthik Spike (×10) | As a natural weapon, kruthiks can launch shards of chitin from their legs like arrows, skewering prey with uncanny accuracy. These lightweight but durable spikes are prized for arrow fletching in the wood-sparse Underdark, and it is not uncommon to find drow quivers filled with them. In fact, one common task for young drow is to form hunting packs to harvest kruthik spikes; hopefully collecting more arrow material than they use. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [+1 Arrow](compendium/items/1-ammunition.md) or [+1 Bolt](compendium/items/1-ammunition.md) |
