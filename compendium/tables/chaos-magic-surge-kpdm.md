| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 1–2 | You cast [hypnotic pattern](compendium/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md) centered on yourself. |
| 3–4 | The target of your spell or ability is also targeted by an [enlarge](compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell. If your spell or ability has no target, the [enlarge](compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell affects you. |
| 5–6 | An angry [constrictor snake](compendium/bestiary/beast/constrictor-snake.md) controlled by the GM appears wrapped around your waist. |
| 7–8 | For 10 rounds, a [gust of wind](compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell blows out from you in all directions. |
| 9–10 | Three targets you can see within 60 feet chosen by you are targeted by a [ray of frost](compendium/spells/ray-of-frost.md) cantrip. |
| 11–12 | You rise 30 feet into the air and hover there until the start of your next turn, when you fall. |
| 13–14 | You grow a purple mustache `dice:3d6\|noform\|avg` (`3d6`) inches in length. |
| 15–16 | You are cloaked in shadow and reek of brimstone for 1 hour. During that time, you have advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks and disadvantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks. |
| 17–18 | You summon a mule 100 feet above the target of your spell or ability. If your spell or ability has no target, the mule appears above you. Both the mule and the creature it lands on take `dice:10d6\|noform\|avg` (`10d6`) bludgeoning damage from the inevitable fall, or the creature under the mule takes no damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw; the DC is equal to your spell save DC. |

| 35–36 | Three creatures within 30 feet that you can see are targeted by a bolt of light that does `dice:1d8\|noform\|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage. Each target can avoid the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. |

| 59–60 | You cast [moonbeam](compendium/spells/moonbeam.md). |
