| 10 | Winter Blood (3 vials) | The blood of an eladrin in its winter form smells like holly leaves and is so dark and viscous it looks like it has already coagulated. This blood has a soporific effect, and eladrin in this state have been found to coat their weapons in it to either subdue their foes or lay to rest a particularly elusive quarry.<br /><br />**Use.** This vial of blood can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the blood takes an action. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws for the next minute. If a creature suffering from this effect is struck by a weapon coated by this blood and then fails the saving throw again, they have their speed reduced to half in addition to the other effects. If they are struck and fail the saving throw any subsequent time, the creature falls [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the next minute, until it takes damage, or until another creature uses an action to shake them awake. If they are awoken through the latter two methods, the creature still suffers from the other two effects of failing the saving throw. Creatures that are immune to either the [poison](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) or [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) conditions are immune to the effects of this item. | 60 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Eladrin Heart | The emotions of an eladrin are more intense and passionate than most mortals could ever comprehend. In fact, from my interviews with the eladrin, I could only describe their feelings as the most pure expression of emotion capable, one untainted by mundane desires and influences. These feelings are so strong that they are even capable of altering the eladrin's physical form and are kept (where else): the heart. If you want to tap into such a primal force, you must be prepared to remove the heart of these creatures, perhaps in doing so, proving why you need an emotional aid in the first place. | 540 gp | 2 lb | [Rod of Seasons](compendium/items/rod-of-seasons-hhhviii.md) |
