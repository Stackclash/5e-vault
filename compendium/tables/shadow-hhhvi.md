| 15 | Shadow Wisp | Shadows barely have a corporeal form, and any that could be considered such is quickly dispersed once their animating force has been defeated. Some of it can be trapped inside a sheet of spirit paper, however, to be used to vex the unwary. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** If this item is left in the shadow of an incapacitated creature for at least 10 minutes, that creature's Strength score is reduced by `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`). The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. This effect lasts until the spell [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) or similar magic is used to remove this effect. If a non-evil humanoid dies while suffering from this effect, a new shadow rises from the corpse `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) hours later. Once this item has been used once, it loses all magical properties. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
