# Swarm of Cranium Rats
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 12*

| 10 | Cranium Rat Brain (Ã—10) | A rodent brain, permanently altered by exposure to an illithid's psionic energy. Divorced from life, these brains have an at times unsettling ability to light up when exposed to the ambient thoughts of sentient creatures. Excavation of illithid colonies have revealed that some of their hallways have been studded with preserved brains to lend them proximity based illumination. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [Idea Bulb](compendium/items/idea-bulb-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Swarm Mentality | **.** When multiple cranium rats swarm together, their latent psionic energy is amplified and swirls about them, which lingers with each surviving member of the swarm even as others die around them. An unorthodox application of [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md) can trap this potent cloud of psionic energy from the last rat of the swarm to be used later for whatever purpose. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** This item starts with a number of charges equal to the number of rats that were in the swarm this item was harvested from. If you are subjected to a divination spell, or any spell that would attempt to either read your thoughts or sense your emotions while wearing this itme on the top of your head, you may spend your reaction to spend a charge and nullify the effects of that spell. Once the last charge on this item has been used, it is rendered worthless. | 60 gp | 1 lb | [Swarm Charms](compendium/items/swarm-charms-hhhvii.md) |
