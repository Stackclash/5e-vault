| — | Heart of Moloch | The heart of Moloch is one corrupted by almost every vice that a creature can have. It is a bloated organ, dripping in ambition, greed, and pride. The sheer fiendish infleucne that radiates from this organ even after removal from its dreadful host allows it to be fashioned into a powerful amulet. | — | 5 lb | [Amulet of the Usurper](compendium/items/amulet-of-the-usurper-hhhviii.md) |
