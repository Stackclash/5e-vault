`dice: [](taverns-and-festivals-secrets-griffonssaddlebag2.md#^secret)`

| dice: d8 | Secret |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | A rare winemaker has suddenly changed their recipe, causing untold hysterics amongst the usual customersâ€”who are now starting to go missing. |
| 2 | An enchantment placed on the business causes many patrons to magically forget their time there once they leave. |
| 3 | The proprietor has significant debt owed to the local thieves' guild. They reluctantly help the guild choose its targets, who are often patrons of their tavern or festival, as they are unable to see another way to repay the debt. |
| 4 | Food provided by the establishment is infused with fey magic, causing a subtle but persistent craving that normal food cannot sate. |
| 5 | The owner is cursed, making it impossible for them to turn a profit on their business due to various freak accidents and sudden expenses. |
| 6 | Food and alcohol served by this proprietor sometimes drain the life of patrons, allowing them to sustain themselves by slightly aging their customers instead. |
| 7 | The employees are united in a plot to murder and usurp the owner, and the owner may or may not be aware and preparing for their attempt. |
| 8 | When this establishment is visited by romantic partners, they seem to inevitably end up arguing and break off their relationship in the coming days. |
