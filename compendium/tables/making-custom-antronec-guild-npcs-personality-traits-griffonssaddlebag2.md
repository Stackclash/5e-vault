| dice: d6 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I easily get distracted by the small details of life, losing track of the big picture. |
| 2 | I'm incredibly competitive with the crafters within my own guild. |
| 3 | I speak far too quickly, as I'm eager to finish conversations and return to work. |
| 4 | To cover my lack of artistic flair, I have to absolutely gush with charm and suave salesmanship. |
| 5 | I'm such a horrible liar that I never make as much profit as others do. |
| 6 | I'm a horribly brusque businessperson, but I stick with it because of my devotion to the art. |
