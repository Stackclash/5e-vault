# Taverns and Festivals; Games and Contests
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 272* 

One of the hallmarks of a good tavern or festival is a quality selection of games and contests that patrons can participate in. Whether these contests require competing against NPCs or luck itself, no carousing montage is complete without a roll of fate's dice. Rewards for winning a game or contest can vary, be it a few coins, bragging rights, free food and drink, trophies, or anything else the competitors agree on.

You can use the table below to randomly determine what type of games the adventurers can find at their current tavern or festival. Consider rewarding your players with inspiration if they decide to take part in the game in real life as well (space, setting, and safety permitting).

If you're using the optional [Drunkenness Level](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/drunkenness-level-griffonssaddlebag2.md) rules found on page 274, and a game specifies the effects of inebriation on a character playing it, you can replace the penalty's amount in the game description with your drunkenness level instead. If the creature already suffers a penalty to the ability check required by the game as a result of its level of drunkenness, you only apply the penalty once.

| dice: d8 | Game or Contest |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Arm Wrestling**: The competitors must attempt to overpower their opponent, first to 3 points wins. Each round requires a Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) contest between both parties, with the higher roll earning a point. If the non-ambidextrous creature uses its non-dominant arm, it has disadvantage on the roll but gains 2 points if it wins that round. If the creature is inebriated, apply a −5 modifier to the roll. |
| 2 | **Bull-Riding**: Competitors attempt to remain on the back of a raging bull for as long as possible using only one hand. Each contestant must make a series of Strength ([Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks with disadvantage. The DC of the check is equal to the bull's Strength score and increases by 1 after each successful check. A creature that rolls a 1 on the check suffers `dice:2d4\|noform\|avg` (`2d4`) piercing damage from the bull's horns. An inebriated creature has a –5 penalty on each ability check made as part of this contest. |
| 3 | **Eating/Drinking Contest**: Up to ten creatures compete by consuming more food or drink than their opponents without retching. This requires a series of Constitution saving throws with increasing DCs, beginning with a DC of 5 and increasing by 3 for each consecutive round. If it's a drinking contest and you're using the [Drunkenness Level](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/drunkenness-level-griffonssaddlebag2.md) rules found later in this document, each round is considered to be 4 drinks. |
| 4 | **Padded-Fist Brawl**: Two creatures face off using padded gloves in a heavily regulated fight within a boxing ring or similar space. Each creature enters combat as normal, but can only attack using padded unarmed strikes that deal a maximum of 1 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The damage is nonlethal, and no contestant is allowed to wear any armor or be carrying any magical items (provided they can be detected). The winner is determined by which contestant successfully lands 4 strikes first. Inebriated creatures have disadvantage on these unarmed strike attack rolls. |
| 5 | **Acrobatic Display**: Any number of competitors attempt to complete an obstacle course as quickly as possible. Each competitor makes 5 consecutive Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) checks. Record each result, adding them together to create a speed score. The contestant with the highest speed score completes the course first and wins the contest. If the creature is inebriated, it has disadvantage on these checks. |
| 6 | **Bulette Takes the Liar**: Two or more players each take `dice:4d6\|noform\|avg` (`4d6`) and a `dice:d20\|noform\|avg` (`d20`), placing the d6s in a cup, tankard, or similar vessel. At the start of each round of the game, both players shake and empty their cups to roll their d6s onto the table, using the cup to hide the result from the other player. Choose three of the four d6s to add together, treating any duplicate numbers after the first as if they were a 0. The goal is to score the lowest total possible. For example, if a player rolled two 1s, a 3, and a 6, the player's lowest point total would be 4 (1 + 0 + 3) by dropping the 6. On the count of three, both players use their d20 to reveal the total value of their roll by placing the result face up on the die. The player with the lowest value wins the round, causing the other player to roll a `dice:d6\|noform\|avg` (`d6`) and gain a number of points equal to the number rolled. A player loses once they have 10 or more points. In the event of a tie, neither player wins the round.<br /><br />You can choose to lie about the result of your d6s and place any number face up on the `dice:d20\|noform\|avg` (`d20`) when you reveal your roll totals. When a player loses, they can choose to accuse the other player of lying by saying "Bulette," at which point the accused player reveals their d6s. If the player was telling the truth, the accuser rolls `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`), instead of one, as a result of losing the round. If the player was lying, they roll `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`) instead. |
| 7 | **Jousting**: Two plate-wearing contestants on horseback charge at one another with a [shield](compendium/items/shield.md) and [lance](compendium/items/lance.md). The contest takes place over a series of rounds. At the start of each round, each contestant must make a Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check—recording the result—followed by an attack roll with the lance against the other contestant. A contestant gains a bonus to its AC for the duration of the round equal to the total of their [Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling) check divided by 5, rounded down. The first contestant to land 3 hits or deal at least 35 piercing damage to the other contestant wins. Damage taken in this way is not subtracted from your hit point total. Inebriated creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks in this contest. |
| 8 | **Singing Contest**: Each competitor must sing a song at the same time as their opponent to see which can either sing louder or put on a better performance. This requires a Constitution ([Performance](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Performance)) or Charisma ([Performance](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Performance)) contest between both parties. If the creature is inebriated, it gains a +5 bonus to the roll if it uses Constitution for the check, or suffers a −5 penalty to the roll if it uses Charisma. |
