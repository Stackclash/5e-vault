# Chasme
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 23* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Chasme Leg (×2) | A chasme's leg is capable of supporting its massive weight when walking on any surface, even upside down. Intrepid adventurers have been known to repurpose these legs as pitons which stick to surfaces rather than stab into them.<br /><br />**Use.** You gain advantage on any Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check made to climb walls so long as you use these legs when doing so. | 5 gp | 20 lb | — |
| 15 | Chasme Proboscis | The proboscis of a chasme has a dark ubiquity among those that hunt demon cults. Too often have they been found on tables of twisted instruments of torture, used to extract blood from kidnapped victims before their inevitable sacrifice. It is truly a horrid feeling to have one's life sucked away by a chasme proboscis, and I would not wish it on my worst enemy. | 40 gp | 10 lb | [Demon Needle](compendium/items/demon-needle-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | Chasme Wing (×2) | The diaphanous wings of a chasme are perhaps their most dangerous appendage. When vibrated at high speeds they create an unbearable buzzing not unlike a monstrous cloud of flies. Ambitious tinkers have studied the physiology of a chasme and figured out how to emulate their musculature in a machine capable of making the same droning noise. | 55 gp | 8 lb | [Drone Producer](compendium/items/drone-producer-hhhvi.md) |
