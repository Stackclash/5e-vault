| 10 | Sprite Dust (small pouch) | **.** The ground up wings of a sprite produce a dust that is capable of replicating the sprite's notable ability to read the hearts of those they touch. Of course, if you've ground up a dead sprite's wings, no one would need magical dust to read your heart.<br /><br />**Use.** If sprinkled over a creature, that creature gains the ability to magically know the emotional state of the next target creature they touch. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the user of the dust also knows the touched creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Sprite Wing (×2) | Sprites are notorious for being hard to catch. Part of this is their small size and agility, but mostly it is due to their ability to turn invisible whenever they wish. This magic is housed in their wings, giving rise to a saying popular in forested cultures: "as obvious as a wingless sprite." | 1 gp | 1 lb | [Dust of Disappearance](compendium/items/dust-of-disappearance.md) |
