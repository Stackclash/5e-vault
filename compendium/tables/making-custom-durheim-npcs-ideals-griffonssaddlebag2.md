| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Order. Structure and manners are the key ingredients in the making of a good life. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Charity. Helping lost souls is a noble calling, and I fully embrace it. (Good) |
| 3 | Aspiration. I find joy in my work, and strive to be the best spiritual guide I possibly can. (Any) |
| 4 | Freedom. I struggle to follow the rules of the order, focusing instead on getting the job done. (Chaotic) |
| 5 | Honesty. I value truth above all, even if it hurts others' feelings. (Lawful) |
| 6 | Joy. I love to feel my spirits being lifted as I guide others to peace. (Good) |
