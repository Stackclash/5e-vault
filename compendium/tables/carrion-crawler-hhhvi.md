| 10 | Carrion Crawler Guts | As their name implies, carrion crawlers feast solely on putrid and rotting flesh. As disgusting as their digestive system may seem, it is uniquely adapted to overcoming any diseases or poisoning that would befall any other creature attempting such a diet. Local healers have thus developed numerous uses for a carrion crawler's guts, ranging from a salve to treat gangrene, to a tonic for treating indigestion. | 5 sp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Carrion Crawler Mucus (vial) | The mucus of a carrion crawler is remarkably poisonous, especially since it only requires contact with the skin to take effect.<br /><br />**Use.** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature is [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A vial of this poison may be applied to coat 1 melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. These remain coated for 10 minutes after which the poison degrades too much to be useful. | 10 gp | 1 lb | — |
