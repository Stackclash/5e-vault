| dice: d8 | I traded my soul, now I'm... |
|----------|------------------------------|
| 1 | *Reckless.* My soul is gone. What more do I have to lose? |
| 2 | *Carefree.* I disappointed my parents long before I lost my soul. I'll be really damned if I don't try to enjoy the rest of my life. |
| 3 | *Doomed.* My grim fate is sealed, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. |
| 4 | *Dutiful.* I paid my price. Now I have to see this through, one last time. |
| 5 | *Nonchalant.* So what? I was gonna end up here anyway. At least this way I got something out of it. |
| 6 | *Regretful.* I've made a terrible mistake. There must be some way to undo this. |
| 7 | *Defiant.* I may have signed away my soul, but I'm not delivering it to them. If they want it that badly, they're goint to have to come and take it. |
| 8 | *Denial.* This is a temporary setback. I'll get my soul back one day. How hard could it be? |
