| 10 | Duergar Brain | Due to generations of horrific experiments by their illithid captors, all duergars possess a unique genetic mutation that grants them psionic powers. Research from both within and without their own society have come to the conclusion that a large part of this potential is due to certain hormone secretions produced by their brains. When brewed properly, a duergar's brain can become a potion that temporarily grants the drinker psionic abilities of their own. | 5 gp | 3 lb | [Potion of the Duergar](compendium/items/potion-of-the-duergar-hhhviii.md) |
| 15 | Duergar Mind Master Blood (3 vials) | **.** A duergar that has managed to attain the title of mind master has undergone a rigorous series of training that has increased their psionic abilities to the extreme. This stressful regiment creates a psionic feedback loop that results in their blood becoming saturated with enzymes and hormones that carry a deadly potency similar to a poison or toxin. In battle, mind masters have a tendency to nick their own flesh so that their blood adds a deadly edge to their strikes.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the blood takes 1 minute. For the next minute, successful hits with this weapon deal an additional `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage. | 3 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
