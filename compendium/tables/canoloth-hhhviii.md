| 5 | Canoloth Ichor (3 vials) | A canoloth is a nightmare for magic users for many reasons; one of which being its ability to prevent them from escaping combat through teleportation. This magical signature remains even through their nasty ichor which can be used in a special tar to ward off a location against magical incursion. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** You may spread this vial of ichor in a thin line of up to 100 feet long. If this line creates a perimeter, no creature may teleport into or out of that space; any attempt to do so is wasted. This effect lasts for 1 year or until the perimeter is broken by washing off a portion of the ichor. Alternatively, you may make a ranged attack with this vial against a creature within 20 feet of you, causing the vial to shatter on impact and spreading the ichor over your target. Until this ichor is washed off, that creature cannot use any magic that would magically teleport it to another location. Washing the ichor off requires complete submersion in water and constant scrubbing for at least 1 minute. | 14 gp | 2 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Canoloth Tongue | Like the guard hounds they vaguely resemble, a canoloth bears a long tongue that it is fond of letting roll from its mouth. Unlike a guard hounds however, this tongue is extremely deadly due to the myriad of spikes covering it. It is quite useful as a whip, and yugoloth taskmasters have been seen carrying canoloth whips, ironically, to motivate other canoloths. | 75 gp | 15 lb | [+1 Whip](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 15 | Canoloth Hide | The hide of a canoloth is rough and hard, but manages to allow a degree of sensitivity that they use to pick up on tiny vibrations and changes in the atmosphere around them. This is partly what allows the canoloth to act as such an uncanny guardsman and this property can be transferred to a magical cloak with much of the same properties. | 185 gp | 30 lb | [Cloak of the Guard](compendium/items/cloak-of-the-guard-hhhviii.md) |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | Gem of Teleportation |
