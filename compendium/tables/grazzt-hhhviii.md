| — | Graz'zt's Heart | Unlike his beautiful countenance, the heart of Graz'zt is a hideous, shrunken, and shrivelled thing to behold. Graz'zt has neglected all genuine emotions of happiness and love in exachange for indulding in mindless sensual pleasures. This has led to the atrophied condition of his heart, within which is contained the many corruptions and hedonistic acts he has ever committed. The sheer concentration of these depravities make the organ a powerful conduit for particularly foul magic. | — | 8 lb | [Amulet of the Dark Prince](compendium/items/amulet-of-the-dark-prince-hhhviii.md) |
