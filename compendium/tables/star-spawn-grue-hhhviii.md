| 5 | Grue Fangs (small bag) | The teeth of the star spawn grue are misshapen, discolored, and many. They are incredibly unsettling to behold and even to own; they seemingly rattle by themselves in their bag, go missing and reappear at random, move too much or too little in relation to how they're shaken, and other strange phenomenon. They are best sold off quickly to whatever strange collector is willing to take them. | 2 sp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Psionic Overflow | The star spawn are notorious for the way in which they interfere with minds of creatures native to the Material Plane. While research on them is sparse at best, it is widely believed that this phenomenon is due to the discordant resonance that their own minds constantly emit that is at odds with our own. Who knows? Perhaps on their own worlds, the star spawn are harmless and peaceful, only becoming violent and cruel when they interact with creatures like us that are incompatible with their own structure of reality. Further study is definitely needed on this topic, thus fueling demand for samples of the star spawn's inherent psychic energy. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
