| 5 | Troll Flesh (30 pounds) | While the taste leaves much to be desired, troll flesh is indeed nutritious and can be a very sustainable source of sustenance. It is however not recommended to be used as a long-term food option, as repeated consumption can lead to strange effects in the eater.<br /><br />**Use.** A pound of troll flesh can be consumed to fulfill any food requirements you may have for an entire day. A pound of troll flesh that has not been exposed to fire or acid will regenerate a quarter pound of flesh every 24 hours. If you eat 3 pounds of troll flesh within a time frame of 7 days, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or undergo a permanent mutation in which one of your body parts changes to look more troll-like (but with no added benefits). This mutation can only be reversed by the [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic. | 1 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Troll Blood (7 vials) | Famous for their regenerative ability, troll blood has widely been used as the basis for the ubiquitous [healing potion](compendium/items/potion-of-healing-gv-dmg.md). Indeed, troll blood is so potent that it can be diluted repeatedly and still deliver a healing effect. As such, it is usually used to mass produce the [basic version of the healing potion](compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md). | 7 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Superior Healing](compendium/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md) |
| 15 | Troll Heart | The troll heart is one of the few organs in a troll's body that is not pledged to their terrible deity: Vaprak the Destroyer. As such, a troll heart is one of the few pieces of a troll that will not form a new troll around itself over time, and yet, its constant infusion of troll blood gives it some measure of regenerative ability which can be infused into an amulet for an ordinary humanoid to take advantage of. | 83 gp | 12 lb | Troll Amulet |
| 20 | Dire Soul | I suppose it makes sense that one of the few ways to make a troll even worse is to cram more trolls into it. That is essentially what a dire troll is, the amalgamated bodies of several trolls fused into one monstrous body by the cannibalistic hunger of the prime one. However, such an alteration of the flesh comes with a corruption of the spirit, as several traces of consumed troll spirit latch onto and corrupt the original's. The result is a dire soul, a spiritual force with very peculiar qualities usable by an experienced thaumaturge. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 1,770 gp | 1 lb | [Amulet of the Dire](compendium/items/amulet-of-the-dire-hhhviii.md) |
