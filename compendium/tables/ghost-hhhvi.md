| 10 | Ectoplasmic Trail (vial) | Rather than bleed blood as a living being would, a ghost instead drips a thin trail of slimy substance known as ectoplasm. Scholars still argue what exactly ectoplasm is, but the current prevailing theory is that it is created when matter from the Ethereal Plane collides with that in the Material Plane during the ghost's jaunts between them. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).** | 15 gp | 1 lb | [Oil of Etherealness](compendium/items/oil-of-etherealness.md) |
| 20 | Spirit Echo | A ghost has no corporeal form and thus leaves little behind to harvest from its actual body. Instead, using spirit paper, an echo of the ghost can be imprinted and stored for later use. Like any instance of using spirit paper, such an imprint is not the soul itself, but a fragile simulacrum. The imprint does possess all of the ghost's memories however, and responds to the speak with dead spell. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 120 gp | 1 lb | [Spectral Gauntlets](compendium/items/spectral-gauntlets-hhhvi.md) |
