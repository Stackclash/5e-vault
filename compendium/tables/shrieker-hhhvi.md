| 15 | Shrieker Spore Colony (vial) | It is difficult to remove the gills of a shrieker without damaging them, however it yields a bounty of spores that can be used in the production of the drink "Shrieker Scotch," the taste of which has been described as "loud." If you are not a fan of alcohol, it can simply be used for magical purposes.<br /><br />**Use.** The shrieker spore colony may be expended as a material component when casting the [alarm](compendium/spells/alarm.md) spell. When cast in this way, the caster does not use a spell slot. | 5 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
