| 10 | Half-Dragon Blood (3 vials) | While regular dragon blood is too foreign to have any effect on a humanoid without significant alteration, the diluted nature of a half-dragon's blood allows it to bestow significant benefits on a humanoid imbiber.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may drink the vial of half-dragon blood. For the next 10 minutes, you gain the same type of damage resistance of the half-dragon it was taken from. | 8 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Half-Dragon Scales (small pouch) | Half-dragons occupy an odd position in the taxonomy of creatures. This is best reflected in the strange effect that their bodies have on the senses of real dragons around them. Their strange physiology seems to cause them to slip beneath the notice of dragons of their own colour, tricking them into thinking they are one of their own. Taking a half-dragon's scales, grinding them into a powder, and then mixing them with oil creates a paste that other humanoids can apply to their own bodies to avoid or promote detection by dragons. | 60 gp | 10 lb | [Dra-gone Paste](compendium/items/dra-gone-paste-hhhvi.md)/[Drag-on Paste](compendium/items/drag-on-paste-hhhvi.md) |
