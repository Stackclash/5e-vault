# Retriever

| 10 | Retriever Leg (×8) | The metal of a retriever's legs are formed of a dark metal alloy that has been untouched by the warmth of the sun. Quite often, the materials that go into the retriever's body are actually stolen by the drow from their duergar neighbors, since drow societies usually do not have the expertise or patience to engage in such difficult metallurgy. Regardless, the end result is an incredibly sharp and durable edge that the retriever uses to either kill its quarry or to fend off anyone trying to protect them. | 30 gp | 50 lb | +2 Melee Piercing or Slashing Weapon |
| 15 | Pedipalp Sensor (×2) | Like all spiders, the retriever also has two small mandibles emerging from the underside of their "mouth" which are meant to funnel prey and food into their deadly maw. However, since a retriever does not eat, these pedipalp are repurposed for the retriever's tracking purposes, capable of finding even the tiniest scent of its quarry in the air. These pedipalp actually remain active when removed carefully from the retriever, however their utility is slightly reduced due to not having the support systems that the rest of the retriever's body would normally provide.<br /><br />**Use.** If you hold an object owned by a creature to one of these pedipalp for at least 1 minute, the pedipalp becomes tuned to that creature. When held loosely in one hand, the pedipalp will reorient itself towards the direction of the creature so long as it is within 5 miles and on the same plane of existence. | 250 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 20 | Retriever Spirit | Drow lack the technological prowess to create a fully sentient automaton the way the gnomes can. Instead, they rely on extraordinarily dark magic to provide the animating force for their constructs: torturing and binding a demon spirit until it can do nothing but obey and serve. The resulting spirit can hardly even be called by its original name, and at this point is little more than a tool to be used like any other. While it is distasteful, a skilled tinker can take this spirit and use it in their own experiments to lend them a darker, but stronger edge. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 1,110 gp | 1 lb | [Tracker Drone](compendium/items/tracker-drone-hhhviii.md) |
| 25 | Beam Turret | One of the retriever's most deadly weapons is the turret located near where its mouth should be. This turret's design is based off of blueprints stolen by the drow from workshops in the Abyss and is capable of firing incredibly potent streams of energy to either kill or debilitate the retriever's opponents. It is incredibly difficult to reverse engineer these turrets, but they can be modified into something more suitable for mortal hands to wield into battle. In a pinch, this turret may also be used to fire the last of its lingering magic, but doing so without the bracing systems that the retriever would normally provide will irreversibly damage this piece.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, forcing them to succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 minute. The [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this ability has been used once, this turret breaks apart and becomes useless. | 4,700 gp | 20 lb | [Demon Cannon](compendium/items/demon-cannon-hhhviii.md) |
