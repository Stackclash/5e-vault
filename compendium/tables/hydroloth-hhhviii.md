# Hydroloth
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 73* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Hydroloth Ichor (3 vials) | **.** As slimy as they were in life, touching the ichor of a hydroloth feels much like sticking your hand into the bottom of a bog. This unnerving feeling comes due to the hydroloth's innate connection to the River Styx, as the hydroloth's ichor is just as capable of tampering with memories as its owner was in life. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** A creature that drinks this ichor must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have their memories stolen. A creature with their memories stolen loses all proficiencies, can't [cast spells](/compendium/rules/actions.md#cast%20a%20spell), can't understand language, and if its Intelligence and Charisma scores are higher than 5, they become 5. Each time the target finishes a long rest, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell cast on the target ends this effect early. | 25 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Hydroloth Claw (×2) | Tipped by hooks designed to drag their victims to the depths, the hydroloth's claws are incredibly deadly and make a wonderful base for constructing weapons such as tridents. | 70 gp | 20 lb | +1 Melee Piercing Weapon |
| 15 | Hydroloth Bladder | **.** Like many amphibians, the hydroloth possesses a bladder in their throats that serves many functions. Other than allowing the hydroloth to survive underwater, it also acts as a supernatural storage mechanism for the hydroloth's memory thefts. In its properly harvested and unaltered state, it can be used to modify one's own memories for whatever purpose you may wish to achieve.<br /><br />**Use.** If you spend 1 minute with this bladder over your head willingly, you may modify your own memories as if you had been subjected to the effects of the [modify memory](compendium/spells/modify-memory.md) spell. You may choose any memory from your entire life to modify, and you decide on which memory is changed and how during the minute you spend with the bladder over your head. Once this bladder is taken off your head, you instantly forget you used it, thus making you oblivious to any altered memories you may now have. Once this ability has been used, this item may not be used again in this way until the next dawn. This item also keeps track of all memories it has altered, removed, or implanted. A creature with this bladder over their head can spend their action to have all of these memories shown to them simultaneously, along with the knowledge of who their original owner was and how the memory has been modified. They may also choose to have a memory permanently erased from the bladder once they are aware of the memory's existence. | 300 gp | 10 lb | [Hood of the Aquatic Ambush](compendium/items/hood-of-the-aquatic-ambush-hhhviii.md) |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | Gem of Teleportation |
