# Death Kiss
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 9* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Death Kiss Blood (5 vials) | The crackling blood of a death kiss is as electrified as a field before a storm. Many foolish adventurers find that their metal weapons turn into conductors of their own deaths when used to strike a death kiss. | 10 gp | 1 lb | Potion of Lightning Blood |
| 15 | Death Kiss Tentacle (Ã—4) | The tentacles of a death kiss lack any ranged capabilities. Instead they are much more capable in melee combat, being lined with vampiric teeth that can drain a victim of blood. The hollow teeth of the death kiss served as the inspiration for the first hypodermic needles, and thus in a strange way, beholders could be seen as the inventors of this medical breakthrough. | 33 gp | 12 lb | [Leeching Whip](compendium/items/leeching-whip-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Death Kiss Main Eye | Unlike most beholders, the eye of a death kiss holds no offensive or defensive abilities. However, when removed, boiled, mashed into a paste, and fortified with arcane components, the resulting mixture makes a potent medicine used to treat blood diseases and other maladies. Alternatively, it makes for a powerful lens to aid in the hunting and tracking of one's foes. | 540 gp | 20 lb | [Bloodhunter's Lens](compendium/items/bloodhunters-lens-hhhvii.md) |
