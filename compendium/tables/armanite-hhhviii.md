# Armanite
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 19* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Armanite Hoof (×4) | The armanite does not so much have hooves as it has four ungodly hard hammers on the end of demonically strong legs. Wielding a weapon made of these hooves can feel like unleashing the trample of a warhorse with every swing. | 3 gp | 10 lb | +1 Melee Bludgeoning Weapon |
| 10 | Armanite Claw (×2) | Like many demons, the claws of an armanite are well suited for rending flesh, but little else. When rushing into battle, armanites can often be found raking their claws along their chest to whip themselves into a blood-fueled frenzy before they crash into their foes. | 6 gp | 5 lb | +1 Melee Piercing Weapon |
| 10 | Armanite Tail | Like a scythe, the tail of an armanite cuts through swathes of its enemies like they were chaff. Wicked, fearsome, and above all, sharp, a warrior wielding this tail as a weapon is truly one to be feared. | 12 gp | 12 lb | +1 Melee Slashing Weapon |
| 15 | Armanite Hide | The hide of an armanite is notoriously tough and practically already tanned by the fires of the Abyss. Not only does the leather created from this hide provide a good deal of protection, it is also unseemingly warm regardless of the environment. | 40 gp | 30 lb | [+1 Studded Leather Armor](compendium/items/1-armor.md) |
| 20 | Armanite Skull | As if the archfiends that first designed the armanite thought that they were not yet dangerous enough, the armanite boasts an innate command of lightning in addition to its arsenal of natural weaponry. Those that have witnessed this power can attest to seeing a charge of electricity running down the armanite's mighty horns before it forms a crackling lance in their hand. Indeed, the skull of the armanite is the key to this devastating ability and once hollowed out, it can unlock it for yourself as well. | 130 gp | 25 gp | Helm of the Thunder Charge |
