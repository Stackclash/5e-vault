| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Merrenoloth Ichor (3 vials) | **.** The ichor of a merrenoloth has a briny odor to it, like the kind of brackish seawater found in the depths of an old ship. It carries some traces of the merrenoloth's mastery of ships, and some superstitious sailors have taken to mixing it with tar and using it to coat their ships to ward them from harm. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may rub this ichor into your hands. For the next 24 hours, you have advantage on any ability check made to helm, steer, or sail a ship. | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Merrenoloth Hide | The thin, tight skin of a merrenoloth resembles that of a sailor that has spent far too long in the salt and sun. While it doesn't make for good armor, there is a seafaring tradition of the most notorious pirates that lure merrenoloths to their ships with contracts, slaughter them, and then craft their flags from their hides. Whether this is true or simply a salty dog tale is still to be confirmed. | 10 gp | 17 lb | — |
| 15 | Merrenoloth Skull | **.** Due to their naturally gaunt faces, the skull of a merrenoloth looks pretty much the same as it did even when it still had skin. Even its now hollow eyes appear to still be able to see, constantly watching over their vessel and ensuring it finds safe passage to its destination.<br /><br />**Use.** This skull provides an inherent protection over whichever ship it is mounted to the front of. If it is mounted on the front facing outwards, the ship always stays on course to the destination that the captain of the ships names. If it is mounted on the front facing inwards, creatures on the ship aren't discomfited by wind or weather, though this effect doesn't protect against damage. | 350 gp | 8 lb | — |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | Gem of Teleportation |
