| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Brontosaurus Toe (×4) | The massive toes of a brontosaurus are strong and durable enough to support its considerable weight. As such, they make wonderful materials to bludgeon one's opponent with. | 30 gp | 15 lb | Any +1 melee bludgeoning weapon |
| 15 | Brontosaurus Neck Sack | One would think that the massive neck of a brontosaurus would not be able to support itself, and yet amazingly it does. Even more amazingly, this is achieved not through magic but by mere physics; the neck of a brontosaurus is actually filled with several air sacks that help support its neck and saves on weight. These air sacks may be repurposed for various tools and equipment, including buoyancy aids for ship hulls. | 60 gp | 20 lb | — |
