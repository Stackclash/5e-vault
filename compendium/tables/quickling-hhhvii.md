| 10 | Quickling Blood (vial) | Quickling blood remains in motion even after it is drained from its body. Thinner than the blood of any other mortal creature, a quickling's blood is loaded with adrenaline and other enzymes that when drunk by a humanoid, slows their perception of time and gives them enhanced reflexes. The crash after the effect has worn off can be rather harsh however.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend your action to drink this blood. If you do so, you gain an extra reaction per round on top of your usual amount. This benefit lasts for 1 hour, after which you suffer one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). | 1 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Quickling Hide | The hide of a quickling is extraordinarily smooth, allowing it to reduce wind resistance as much as physically possible. While it may seem barbaric, their hide makes a wonderful base for the ubiquitous boots of speed. | 4 gp | 7 lb | [Boots of Speed](compendium/items/boots-of-speed.md) |
