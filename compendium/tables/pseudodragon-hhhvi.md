| 10 | Pseudodragon Venom (vial) | The venom of a pseudodragon has a soporific effect that some alchemists have actually used to create a draught to treat insomnia. Of course, in its pure state, it can still be used as an effective tranquilliser.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat 1 piece of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes an action. The next time that the coated ammunition or weapon successfully hits a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it awake. | 5 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
