| 5 | Dryad Hair | Hair is used as a loose term, as the material covering a dryad's head more resembles loose foliage and vines than actual hair. Still, it is beautiful to behold and surprisingly strong. More ostentatious adventurers use the hair as rope to commemorate their conquest of a dryad...in either sense of the term. | 2 sp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Dryad Sap (vial) | Instead of blood, dryads have a sap-like substance flowing through their bodies. This sap contains magical properties and can enhance the durability of a creature that is rubbed on.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat one medium or smaller creature. Applying the sap takes 1 minute, after which the sap takes effect. While under the effect of the sap, that creature is under an effect identical to that of the [barkskin](compendium/spells/barkskin.md) spell. This effect does not require any concentration check to maintain however. This effect lasts for 1 hour. | 8 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Dryad Eye (×2) | Many who have wandered through the forest at night can attest to seeing two orbs of silver or gold, dancing through the tree branches, and beckoning them to join them. These are usually the eyes of a dryad, and there are not many living creatures that can gaze into them and not be enthralled. The eyes maintain these properties even after the dryad is killed and their eyes transfigured into useful equipment for adventurers. | 4 gp | 1 lb | [Eyes of Charming](compendium/items/eyes-of-charming.md) |
