| 5 | Darkling Ash (small pouch) | The burnt remains of a darkling after its absorbed light has burst out. While it is disappointing that most of their body has been made unharvestable, the ash still holds some magical properties as a light nullifier. This should be obvious in that it was the only portion of the darkling's body to not disintegrate when exposed to a light flash.<br /><br />**Use.** When you cast the [darkness](compendium/spells/darkness.md) spell, you may expend 1 or more pouches of this ash instead of the usual material components. If you do so, the radius of the magical darkness you create expands by 5 feet for every pouch of ash you expend. | 2 gp | 2 lb | [Potion of Radiant Resistance](compendium/items/potion-of-radiant-resistance.md) |
