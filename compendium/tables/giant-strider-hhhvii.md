# Giant Strider
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 18* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Giant Strider Tongue | The hard tongue of a giant strider makes a distinctive clicking sound in their beaks. By striking their tongues against their beaks, giant striders create sparks that light the gas they shoot from their innards, resulting in a deadly stream of fire that turns their prey into a tasty roast.<br /><br />**Use.** This tongue can be used in place of a [tinder](compendium/items/tinderbox.md). | 5 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Giant Strider Hide | The distinctive red hide of a giant strider is surprisingly flexible and comfortable if tanned into a set of leather clothes. The fetching hue and its natural warmth make it a valuable trade good for mountain societies. | 6 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 15 | Giant Strider Gas Bladder | A melon sized bladder located just above the giant strider's lungs. This bladder contains a highly flammable gas that the giant strider uses to kill and cook their prey. This gas is harvested by firenewts for usage in their alchemy, which often imparts their potions with the distinctive methane odour of a giant strider's innards.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may burst this bladder, spreading a cloud of highly flammable gas in a 10 foot-foot radius. Any creature within this cloud has vulnerability to fire damage. The cloud disperses 1 minute after being created, or if it is ignited. This item may also be thrown up to 20 feet, bursting on impact with the ground. | 6 gp | 4 lb | — |
