# Grymclover Forests; Becoming Lost
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 278* 

Finding your way through a forest that's been mutated like this is exceptionally difficult due to the dense brambles, thick canopy, and low visibility. When a character makes a Wisdom ([Survival](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to navigate to a specific location within the forest, consult the [Grymclover Navigation DCs](compendium/tables/grymclover-forests-grymclover-navigation-dcs-griffonssaddlebag2.md) table. On a failed check, they become lost and suffer a setback determined by the [Becoming Lost](compendium/tables/grymclover-forests-becoming-lost-griffonssaddlebag2.md) table.

| dice: d8 | Setback |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Completely lost, the party gets turned around and ends the day at the edge of the forest where they initially entered. |
| 2â€“7 | Confused and wandering, the party ends the day up to `dice:2d4\|noform\|avg` (`2d4`) miles in a random direction away from their intended destination for that day. |
| 8 | Despite getting lost, the party recovers and ends the day only `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) miles away from their intended destination for that day. |
