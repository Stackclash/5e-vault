# Flind
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 23* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gnoll Tooth (small pouch) | The sharp, irregular teeth of a gnoll. Not worth much other than as a trophy. Harvesters are advised to wash them at the first chance, as they carry the stench of a gnoll's mouth long after removal. | 1 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Mark of Yeenoghu | As an homage to their demonic overlord, particularly zealous gnolls paint themselves with the mark of [Yeenoghu](compendium/bestiary/npc/yeenoghu-mpmm.md) using the blood of their victims. The brands have little of their intended effect of making the gnoll invulnerable, but mostly just due to the gnoll's own incompetence. The marks themselves actually do possess a degree of magic that demonologists value as a research material and component. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Demon Gnoll Heart | A flind is a gnoll that has been particularly touched by the demon prince [Yeenoghu](compendium/bestiary/npc/yeenoghu-mpmm.md). If one carves out its heart, they will find that it drips not with blood, but instead a foul ichor that both resembles, and smells like, the drool of a rabid hyena. | 10 gp | 2 lb | [Yeenoghu's Boon](compendium/items/yeenoghus-boon-hhhvi.md) |
