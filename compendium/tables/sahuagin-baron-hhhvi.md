| 5 | Sahuagin Blood (3 vials) | Sahuagin are notoriously prone to mutations, manifesting in effects as varied as developing elven characteristics or an extra set of arms. This mutagenic effect works both ways, and their blood is capable of transferring some of a sahuagin's traits to a regular humanoid. It is strongly advised against regular intake of this however, as the full side effects are still unknown. | 5 sp | 1 lb | [Potion of the Sahuagin](compendium/items/potion-of-the-sahuagin-hhhvi.md) |
