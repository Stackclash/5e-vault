# Gray Render
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 49* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gray Render Claw (Ã—2) | A gray render's claw resembles that of a bear's, and like a bear's, they are capable of mauling a target as well as rudimentary grasping. The gray render often employs both these functions when serving its master, slaughtering some prey before dragging the carcass back like an oversized, monstrous puppy. | 85 gp | 15 lb | +2 Melee Slashing Weapon |
| 15 | Gray Render Hide | Due to their vaguely psionic and mystical nature, the hide of a gray render has more uses than for simply tanning into a suit of armor (although it is certainly quite useful for that). One use that has always stood out to me, is its use as sheets on a marital bed. It is believed by some cultures that any freshly wed couple that sleeps upon a gray render blanket on their first night as a couple will be loyal to one another for life the way that the gray render is loyal to their chosen master. I cannot verify the validity of this claim, but I can attest that sleeping on a lumpy, tough, gray sheet is not the most romantic way to begin your marriage. | 380 gp | 20 lb | [+2 Leather Armor](compendium/items/2-armor.md) or [+2 Studded Leather Armor](compendium/items/2-armor.md) |
| 20 | Gray Render Brain | The gray render is known for forming lifelong bonds with a creature that it declares as its master. This need for companionship is so strong that it warps the gray render's brain, enlarging portions responsible for emotional attachment and increasing the production of certain enzymes and hormones. As such, a gray render's brain is a treasure trove for any alchemist looking to mix together a bewildering brew or charming concoction. | 1,000 gp | 3 lb | [Philter of Love](compendium/items/philter-of-love.md) or [Concoction of Companionship](compendium/items/concoction-of-companionship-hhhviii.md) |
