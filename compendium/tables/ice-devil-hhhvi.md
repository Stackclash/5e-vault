# Ice Devil
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 29* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Ice Devil Blood (5 vials) | Ice devils bleed a blue substance that resembles dirty slush. If one melts this blood down and then re-thickens it with certain powders, the resulting potion is capable of making the drinker impervious to even the most fierce winter. | 80 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Winterbite](compendium/items/potion-of-winterbite-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | Ice Devil Mandible (Ã—2) | It is said that being pierced by the mandibles of an ice devil feels like being impaled upon an icicle. As such, it seemed obvious that weaponsmiths would scramble to attach them to sticks and hilts to make weapons that harness the power of pure winter. | 550 gp | 8 lb | [Frostbite Weapon](compendium/items/frostbite-weapon-hhhvi.md) |
| 25 | Ice Devil Carapace | The chitinous shell of the ice devil is colder and harder than an ancient buried ice sheet, and requires patience and a sharp ice pick to harvest in tact. Using a specialised forge, a very skilled blacksmith can reshape this carapace into a suit of armor that can protect the wearer from any form of extreme temperature. | 5,000 gp | 80 lb | [Frostbite Armor](compendium/items/frostbite-armor-hhhvi.md) |
