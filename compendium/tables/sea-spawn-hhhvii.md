# Sea Spawn
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 41* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Sea Spawn Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a sea spawn more resembles a dark brine than blood. Imbued with the magic that warped its original owner into a creature of the depths, this blood possesses a mutagenic effect that can grant humanoids some degree of amphibiousness when used correctly. | 1 sp | 1 lb | [Potion of Water Breathing](compendium/items/potion-of-water-breathing.md) |
| 15 | Sea Spawn Teeth (small bag) | Sharp as a shark's and almost as numerous, the teeth of a sea spawn make nice collectibles when strung on necklaces and bracelets. Some coastal communities have taken to using them as fishing hooks in the belief that they increase the sizes of their catch. | 5 sp | 2 lb | [Big Catch Hooks](compendium/items/big-catch-hooks-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Sea Spawn Quills (×6) | **.** These quills possess the same poison found in a pufferfish, but with a higher yield appropriate for its upscaled owner. The quills maintain the poison for some time, making them useful as [darts](compendium/items/dart.md).<br /><br />**Use.** You may use these quills as a [dart](compendium/items/dart.md). Any creature hit by this [dart](compendium/items/dart.md) must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a [dart](compendium/items/dart.md) has [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) a creature in this way, it loses this property and becomes a normal [dart](compendium/items/dart.md). | 1 sp | — | — |
| 15 | Sea Spawn Tentacle | Extremely slimy and unpleasant to the touch, it is unfortunate that the tentacle loses much of its form and gripping strength after the demise of its owner. It does however have use as a waterproof rope, and it is not uncommon to find small wharfs in coastal communities lashed together with these tentacles. | 1 gp | 9 lb | — |
