| 5 | Sahuagin Blood (3 vials) | Sahuagin are notoriously prone to mutations, manifesting in effects as varied as developing elven characteristics or an extra set of arms. This mutagenic effect works both ways, and their blood is capable of transferring some of a sahuagin's traits to a regular humanoid. It is strongly advised against regular intake of this however, as the full side effects are still unknown. | 5 sp | 1 lb | [Potion of the Sahuagin](compendium/items/potion-of-the-sahuagin-hhhvi.md) |
| 10 | Blessing of Sekolah | Occasionally, the shark god Sekolah chooses a female sahuagin to be one of their priestesses and imbues them with great divine power. Their spellwork aside, these priestesses can be identified by a marking on the priestesses skin that resembles the bite pattern of a full grown shark. This skin can be used as a short-term charm to copy the shark taming ability of a sahuagin.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may raise this blessing in front of you. Any shark within 120 feet of you that can see you instantly becomes friendly towards you and obeys any command you issue to it, so long as that command does not conflict with that of a real sahuagin. 24 hours after being removed from its original body, this blessing deteriorates and becomes useless. | 3 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
