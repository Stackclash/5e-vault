| 15 | Living Chain | The chains of this devil's namesake occupy a unique space between animate and inanimate. They are bewitched by similar magic to the notorious animated objects that are often found in an abandoned wizard's tower, and thus make excellent material for the crafting of magical items. | 150 gp | 20 lb | [Iron Bands of Bilarro](compendium/items/iron-bands-of-bilarro.md) or [Chain of Entanglement](compendium/items/chain-of-entanglement-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | Chain Devil Eye (Ã—2) | The gaze of the chain devil is renowned for its unnerving countenance. Those who stare at it for too long swear that they see the faces of those they'd rather forget. With some enchantments and a bit of craftsmanship, the eyes can be inserted into a mask that can strike the same fear into the wearer's enemies. | 200 gp | 1 lb | [Mask of Fear](compendium/items/mask-of-fear-hhhvi.md) |
