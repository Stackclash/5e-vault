| 10 | Autumn Blood (3 vials) | The blood of an eladrin in its autumn form smells sweet like seasonal spices and shines golden like freshly drawn syrup. Due to these properties, their blood is capable of attracting and calming wild beasts. In fact, autumn eladrin are often found to carry needles with which to prick their fingers should they ever need to calm an animal raging in their domain.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may spill this blood over the ground adjacent to you, or on a space up to 20 feet away. Either way, as soon as you do so, all beasts with an Intelligence score of 6 within 30 feet of the spilled blood that can smell are instantly calmed as if affected by the [calm emotions](compendium/spells/calm-emotions.md) spell. If you spill this blood on yourself, you have advantage on any Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks that you make to convince a beast that can smell the blood to make a non-violent action. Spilled blood dries 10 minutes after first being exposed to the air, after which it becomes useless. | 60 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Eladrin Heart | The emotions of an eladrin are more intense and passionate than most mortals could ever comprehend. In fact, from my interviews with the eladrin, I could only describe their feelings as the most pure expression of emotion capable, one untainted by mundane desires and influences. These feelings are so strong that they are even capable of altering the eladrin's physical form and are kept (where else): the heart. If you want to tap into such a primal force, you must be prepared to remove the heart of these creatures, perhaps in doing so, proving why you need an emotional aid in the first place. | 540 gp | 2 lb | [Rod of Seasons](compendium/items/rod-of-seasons-hhhviii.md) |
