| dice: d8 | Example Dungeon Origin | Example Dungeon Inhabitant |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | A spiraling, spiked tower built by a legendary necromancer, such as Dendallen (saddleb.ag/dendallen), or an ancient [lich](compendium/bestiary/undead/lich.md). | Roving bands of mindless undead loosely controlled by [wights](compendium/bestiary/undead/wight.md), an inexperienced necromancer, or other powerful undead. |
| 2 | The grove and accompanying settlement of an old [druid](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) circle that worshipped a wrathful, primeval god of nature. | Acolyte [druids](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) follow the footsteps of their spiritual or literal ancestors, working to summon an avatar of their deity to the Material Plane. |
| 3 | A complex of huts and cottages belonging to a coven of [green hags](compendium/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md) that dabbled in magic forbidden even by others of their kind. | One or more young [green hags](compendium/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md) or [dryads](compendium/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) tapping into the corruptive enchantment for power and knowledge. |
| 4 | The lair of a powerful [ancient green dragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-green-dragon.md) trained in druidic magic. | A mixture of [kobolds](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md), [cultists](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md), and [cult fanatics](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) attempting to resurrect a long-dead dragon by any means necessary. |
| 5 | The ruined capital city of a nation of ambitious elves that delved too deeply into the arcane and druidic magic of ecological transmutation. | Various hostile plant life and even some sentient plant creatures nourished and empowered by the residual corruption of the forest. |
| 6 | A sprawling and decrepit estate manor, where a cruel [vampire](compendium/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) reigned by blood and terror. | A group of [vampires](compendium/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) and their surviving spawn have fled from crusaders, plotting and preparing their vengeance. |
| 7 | A camp from which a terrifyingly large and vicious [gnoll](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) band terrorized a vast swathe of the surrounding region. | [Bandits](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) or other scavengers are using the dungeon as their base of operations, but the forest's magic is causing them to mutate. |
| 8 | Ruins containing a still partly active summoning circle, where an infamous diabolist released dozens of devils and demons into the world. | A jagged tear in reality itself is allowing various fiends to cross from the Lower Planes onto the Material Plane, potentially heralding a massive invasion on the horizon. |
