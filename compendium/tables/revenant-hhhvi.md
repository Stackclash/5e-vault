| 20 | Imprint of Vengeance | A revenant's body contains nothing of value that an ordinary corpse would not already possess, and it is usually beyond the abilities of an average harvester to seal away the vengeance fuelled soul of a revenant. However, with quick action and some spirit paper, an imprint of the soul may be saved, allowing one to track the creature that wronged the revenant so badly. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** While holding this item, you constantly know the distance to and direction of any creature against which the revenant seeks revenge, even if the creature is on a different plane of existence. You become aware if the creature being tracked dies. While holding this paper, the revenant is similarly also aware of your distance and direction to them. | Varies | 1 lb | â€” |
