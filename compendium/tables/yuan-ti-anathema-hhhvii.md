# Yuan-Ti Anathema
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 47* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Yuan-Ti Blood (7 vials) | The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Poison Immunity](compendium/items/potion-of-poison-immunity-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Yuan-Ti Poison (2 vials) | The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes in nature. The poison has been described by survivors like "having one's blood transfigured into fire."<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 120 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Anathema Heart | A yuan-ti anathema constantly emits an aura of fear and loathing that cause creatures around it to flee. While this ability could easily be chalked up to any attribute of the anathema, magically speaking, it actually comes from its heart. Although this ability seems to cease once the heart stops beating, some mad tinkers have discovered ways to reanimate a heart long after its demise, thus allowing it to be repurposed as a useful magical trinket. | 750 gp | 3 lb | [Anathema Device](compendium/items/anathema-device-hhhvii.md) |
| 25 | Anathema Spine | A yuan-ti spine is truly unique due to the number of branches it bares at the top to connect its many heads. Strong natural magic is required to support this twist of nature, and this magic can be invoked once the spine has been transformed into a magical staff. | 2,500 gp | 23 lb | [Staff of Split Control](compendium/items/staff-of-split-control-hhhvii.md) |
