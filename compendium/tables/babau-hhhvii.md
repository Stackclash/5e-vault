# Babau
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 14* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Babau Horn | Made of a special type of keratin harder than any regular creature's, a babau horn makes a particularly deadly weapon. It is said that people slain by weapons forged from these horns die particularly painfully, and bleed out unusually slowly, but this is unconfirmed. | 6 gp | 10 lb | Any +1 melee piercing weapon |
| 15 | Babau Eye (Ã—2) | A babau is capable of weakening those it gazes at, channeling the dark countenance of Graz'zt as it stares into one's soul. As conduits of this power, they make wonderful components for the creation of curses, something that Graz'zt probably approves of. | 10 gp | 1 lb | [Curse of Weakening](compendium/items/curse-of-weakening-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Babau Skin | The tight black skin of a babau resembles worn leather in the way that it creases and fades with the movement of the demon. Despite its horrid aesthetic, these same properties make it a natural vellum, and when inscribed properly, can become the vessel of particularly dark magic. | 100 gp | 5 lb | [Demon Vellum](compendium/items/demon-vellum-hhhvii.md) |
