| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Fomorian Growth (Ã—5) | The many carbuncles, blisters, pustules, and boils of a fomorian may seem disgusting, but as marks of their ancient curse they actually hold small amounts of magical signatures. Alchemists have been known to take these growths and brew a rather nasty, but ultimately harmless potion. | 20 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Ruined Flesh](compendium/items/potion-of-ruined-flesh-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Fomorian Eye | The infamous "evil eye" of the fomorian. Known for inflicting curses and great pain upon any who draw the ire of its host. Even when removed from its socket, it seems to stare back at whomever gazes at it. | 250 gp | 2 lb | [Fomorian Crystal](compendium/items/fomorian-crystal-hhhvi.md) |
