| 10 | Marilith Blood (5 vials) | Mariliths are renowned for the supernatural reflexes and inhuman co-ordination that allows them to fight with six arms seamlessly. By placing their blood in a crucible, an experienced alchemist can extract the adrenaline from a marilith's blood and mix it into a potion that allows a mortal to temporarily emulate the agility of this fearsome demon. | 100 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Reflexes](compendium/items/potion-of-reflexes-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Marilith Snake Leather | While it resembles an ordinary snake, the skin of the marilith's reptilian tail is harder and tougher than most plate armor. It is a rare craftsman that possesses the skills to properly work this leather, but finding one is worth it for the almost impenetrable armor you will receive. | 1,400 gp | 30 lb | [+2 Studded Leather Armor](compendium/items/2-armor.md) |
| 20 | Marilith Spine | While their top halves may superficially resemble a humans with a few additional limbs, the internal physiology of a marilith differs dramatically. Most noticeably in their spines which have been adapted to support the numerous extra limbs and lower appendage of this demon. This spine may serve as the frame of an audacious magical cape that grants an extra "helping hand" in battle. | 5,000 gp | 30 lb | [Cape of Helping Hands](compendium/items/cape-of-helping-hands-hhhvi.md) |
