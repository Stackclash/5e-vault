# Alpha Grick
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 61*

| 10 | Alpha Grick Tentacle (×4) | The deadly tentacle of a grick is both rubbery and sharp. However, after prolonged tenderising, boiling, and seasoning, these tentacles make for a delicacy that several Underdark races have come to enjoy. It is usually served with a sauce reduced from the grick's own blood. It is an acquired taste to say the least. | 1 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Alpha Grick Hide | The skin of a grick has a unique shade and hue that allows it to blend into its rocky surroundings with ease. While difficult to remove properly from its rubbery carcass, the resulting hide makes for good camouflage clothes. | 10 gp | 22 lb | Grick Hide Cloak |
| 20 | Grick Pearl | The grick that has become large enough to lead other gricks as an alpha is usually the one that has lived long enough to eat the most stuff. Because of the grick's voracious appetite and low intelligence, sometimes this stuff includes the treasures of the hapless victims that cross its path. In rare circumstances, these treasures can sit in the grick's digestive system for a prolonged time and form a pearl. This pearl resembles whatever mish-mash of materials created it, but coated with what appears to be a supernaturally dark hue that never goes away despite the lighting. This pearl can be taken by artificers and crafted into an item that taps into its inherent connection to the Underdark. | 185 gp | 5 lb | [Gem of the Underdark](compendium/items/gem-of-the-underdark-hhhvi.md) |
