# Cave Fisher
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 11* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Cave Fisher Blood (3 vials) | Cave fisher blood is known not just for being alcoholic, but also being particularly flammable. In other words, this blood is capable of warming you up one way or another.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw this vial at a target you can see within 20 feet of you as a ranged attack. This vial shatters on impact, covering your target in flammable liquid. That target has vulnerability to fire damage until the end of your next turn. | 5 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Cave Fisher Carapace | Incredibly hard and with a strangely attractive milky white tone, cave fisher carapaces are highly valued in subterranean societies. They have been used for everything from tools, to armor, to jewelry, and ironically its value has made cave fishers an endangered species in some areas. | 10 gp | 40 lb | — |
| 15 | Cave Fisher Filament (60 feet) | The notorious adhesive filament of a cave fisher is difficult to extract without muddling it up into an unusable sticky ball. If such a thing is available, it is advised that you wrap your filament around a bolt of silk cloth, as the filament has trouble sticking to this material, allowing you to unwind it later with ease. Once an artificer has gotten their hands on this filament, they can easily turn it into the ever useful [rope of climbing](compendium/items/rope-of-climbing.md). This fact has made cave fishers particularly valuable for hunters trying to make some quick cash.<br /><br />**Use.** This filament may be unspooled like a regular piece of rope. The filament sticks to anything it touches, except for silk. A creature that touches the filament becomes immediately adhered to it. A creature adhered to the filament is considered [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free. | 20 gp | 10 lb | [Rope of Climbing](compendium/items/rope-of-climbing.md) |
