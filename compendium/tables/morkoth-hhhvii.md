| 10 | Morkoth Humor (10 vials) | **.** A pearly-white substance found in distilled morkoth blood, this humor is believed to be derived from the celestial substance that first birthed this bizarre species. The celestial substance was believed to be some sort of solidified healing magic, lost in the chaotic spaces of the Astral Plane. As such, it makes for a fantastic base for particularly powerful healing potions or to bolster one's healing magic.<br /><br />**Use.** When you cast a spell that would result in a creature recovering hit points without doing damage, you may expend 1 or more vials of morkoth humor as an additional material component. If you do so, you skip rolling a certain amount of dice to determine the amount of hit points recovered, and instead gain the maximum value of that dice roll. The amount of dice skipped is equal to the amount of vials of morkoth humor you expended. | 6 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Superior Healing](compendium/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md) |
| 15 | Morkoth Eye (×2) | Those that have met a morkoth can attest to their strangely enchanting eyes that lure in unwary adventurers to their doom. It is thought by some that the salty dog tale of "lure lights" that cause sailors to throw themselves into the ocean are actually morkoths trying to add a few creatures to its collection. | 120 gp | 1 lb | [Lenses of Hypnosis](compendium/items/lenses-of-hypnosis-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Morkoth Tentacle (×2) | Much like many cephalopods, a morkoth's tentacles is more than a simple appendage: it contains numerous nerve endings and neurons that allows it to act as an extension of the morkoth's brain. As such, morkoths can display an uncanny amount of control over their limbs, as well as gain much more sensory information from them than you and I can using our hands and fingers. These traits can be passed off onto a magical whip that almost moves independently in a wielder's hands. | 250 gp | 15 lb | [Whip of Extended Reach](compendium/items/whip-of-extended-reach-hhhvii.md) |
| 25 | Morkoth Gladius | A morkoth's gladius is a long piece of cartilage that runs through the entirety of its main body and is often thought of as the "spine" of a morkoth. Incredibly hardy, the gladius is responsible for the remarkable spell reflection ability possessed by the morkoth, and can be transformed into a magical kite shield with similar properties. | 1,450 gp | 30 lb | [+1 Shield of Reflection](compendium/items/1-shield-of-reflection-hhhvii.md) |
