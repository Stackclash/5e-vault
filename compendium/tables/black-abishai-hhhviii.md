# Black Abishai
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 29* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Mark of Tiamat | An abishai is created when Tiamat interferes with the cycle of life and death, snagging a mortal soul before it can move on and transforming it into a monstrous draconic creature to serve her whims in the Hells. This act permanently scars a soul, staining it with the Dragon Queen's mark for all eternity. Upon the abishai's death, this mark can be captured by an enterprising harvester and used to channel the power of Tiamat against her will. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 20 gp | 1 lb | [Tiamat's Boon](compendium/items/tiamats-boon-hhhviii.md) |
| 15 | Devil Wing (Ã—2) | Like real dragons, the abishai are gifted with the power of flight by their queen. The powerful wings that they bear are capable of tremendously high speeds, and like many devils, can be harvested and recrafted into the ever useful [infernal wings](compendium/items/infernal-wings-hhhvi.md). | 25 gp | 20 lb | [Infernal Wings](compendium/items/infernal-wings-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | Black Abishai Horn | The needs of Tiamat are many, and she creates her servants to serve specific functions. This usually comes in the form of the abishai's horns which, much like a real dragon, contain much of the essence of their power. The black abishai is a master of infiltration and subterfuge, fueled by the dark magic in their horns. Alchemists have found ways to ground their horns down into a disorienting powder that is prized by thieves and assassins alike. | 130 gp | 10 lb | [Dust of Darkness](compendium/items/dust-of-darkness-hhhviii.md) |
