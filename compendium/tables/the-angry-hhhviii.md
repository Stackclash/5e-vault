*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 62* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Boiling Blood (3 vials) | The blood of the angry permanently bubbles and boils, long after death has finally calmed their rage. Within this blood is the pure manifestation of the Shadowfell's fury: the feeling of malevolence and frustration that all creatures who become trapped there inevitably feel about their imprisonment.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this blood, you become preternaturally angry for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you cannot [cast](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Cast%20a%20Spell) or maintain concentration on any spells, but any time a creature damages you, you have advantage on weapon attacks against that creature until the end of your next turn. If you hit on this attack, you may roll an additional damage dice from your weapon and add the result to your total. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Sorrowsworn Anger Hook (×2) | The hooks that make the Angry's hands are more than simple keratin or bone like would be found on normal monsters. Instead, these hooks are formed from pure emotion and are able to channel the psychic rage that the sorrowsworn feels at all times. Transforming it for mortal use is a difficult task, but the result is a chain that can when used in battle, can transform even the most devoted pacifist into a rage-fueled embodiment of violence. | 250 gp | 10 lb | [Chain of Violence](compendium/items/chain-of-violence-hhhviii.md) |
| 20 | Primal Anger | The sorrowsworn are beings of pure emotion, spawned from the collective psyche of the Shadowfell itself. After their corporeal forms have been slain, this emotion leaks back into its home plane, unless captured first by a harvester skilled with their [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md). Whenever this emotion is released, it will then embody the closest creature to it, temporarily granting a myriad of abilities depending on the sorrowsworn. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the anger inside to possess the nearest living creature for the next 10 minutes. While possessed by anger, a creature has advantage on melee weapon attacks and all attacks against them have advantage. Whenever a creature possessed by anger successfully hits a target with a melee weapon attack, they may choose to make a [shove](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Shove) attack against that target as a bonus action. | 1,000 gp | 1 lb | — |
