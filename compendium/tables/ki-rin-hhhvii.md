# Ki-Rin
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 28* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Ki-Rin Blood (7 vials) | The shimmering, golden blood of a ki-rin flows like and resembles fresh honey. Wherever the blood spills, plant-life is sure to flourish, which often causes the death sites of ki-rin to become magnificent gardens in their honor. The vigor granting properties of the ki-rin's blood is easily mixed into potions and is thus a valuable reagent for all sorts of restorative potions. | 20 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Vigor](compendium/items/potion-of-vigor-hhhvii.md) |
| 10 | Ki-Rin Fur (7 bolts) | Shining like spun gold, but softer than silk, the fur of a ki-rin is coveted far and wide for the spinning of clothes worthy of only kings and emperors. Aside from its use in tailoring, the restorative magic inherent to the ki-rin makes their fur wonderful for use as a bandage, and ki-rin fur can be found standard in the healing kits of imperial palaces.<br /><br />**Use.** You may choose to use a bolt of ki-rin fur as a bandage whenever you roll a hit die to recover hit points during a short rest. If you do so, you forgo the roll and instead gain the maximum value possible from that die. A ki-rin fur bandage that has been used once may not be used again until it has been soaked in clean water for at least 8 hours. | 33 gp | 1 lb | [Sun Stream Bow](compendium/items/sun-stream-bow-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Ki-Rin Scales (large pouch) | Golden like the morning sun, the scales of a ki-rin are inherently magical and protect their wearer with magical strength. The scales must be treated more like the hide of a reptile and be tanned properly in order to be useful, but they make for a heavenly suit of armor once that is all done. | 385 gp | 35 lb | [Golden Sun Armor](compendium/items/golden-sun-armor-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Ki-Rin Hoof (Ã—4) | The copper-colored hooves of a ki-rin are much harder than the metal they resemble. Once reinforced and attached to a sturdy handle, they are capable of smiting evil even after the demise of their owner. | 92 gp | 12 lb | Any +2 melee bludgeoning weapon |
| 20 | Ki-Rin Heart | The wisdom of a ki-rin is legendary, and their hearts are capable of detecting evil and lies whenever they are in their presence. When their powerful magic is imbued into a golden set of scales, they are capable of continuing their judgement of the wicked even beyond death. | 750 gp | 3 lb | [Heart Scales](compendium/items/heart-scales-hhhvii.md) |
| 25 | Ki-Rin Horn | The horn of a ki-rin radiates a faint golden hue even after removal from its original owner. Despite superficially resembling an ordinary horn, the horn of a ki-rin is formed from a special keratin that channels magical energies particularly well and is thus suited for making magical wands, staves, and rods. | 2,650 gp | 4 lb | [Wand of the Golden Ray](compendium/items/wand-of-the-golden-ray-hhhvii.md) |
