# Maurezhi
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 20* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Maurezhi Blood (3 vials) | **.** This black, tar-like substance resembles the coagulated blood found on murdered corpses. If you have the stomach for it, it can be rubbed on one's body to mask the presence radiated by all living beings that the undead can detect.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend 1 minute to cover yourself in this blood. If you do so, undead creatures with an Intelligence of less than 10 have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks to find you. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until the blood is washed off, whichever comes first. | 5 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 15 | Maurezhi Claw (×2) | The claws of the ghoul-like creatures are well known for their paralyzing touch, and there are many a horror story of adventurers devoured alive by these abominations while they could do nothing but lie there helpless (of course one has to wonder how this story could be true if they are alive to tell it, but I digress). | 6 gp | 6 lb | [Paralyzing Dust](compendium/items/paralyzing-dust-hhhvi.md) |
| 20 | Maurezhi Hide | Despite its undead nature, a maurezhi does not rot or decompose. While this only adds to its unnerving nature, its skin does have certain properties useful for a harvester. Some of the original designs for the renowned bag of colding used maurezhi hide as its main material. | 10 gp | 12 lb | [Bag of Colding](compendium/items/bag-of-colding-hhhvi.md) |
| 25 | Maurezhi Fang (×2) | As the "lieutenant" of ghouls, the maurezhi has the dubious gift of being able to convert its prey into a new [ghoul](compendium/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) to serve it. It does so by using its fangs to literally sap away a creature's will and individuality. I have seen compatriots and hirelings die in more ways than I can count, but I can honestly say that there is nothing more chilling than watching a person's very identity fade away as a ravenous demon drains the very identity out of them. | 300 gp | 1 lb | [Dagger of Apathy](compendium/items/dagger-of-apathy-hhhviii.md) |
