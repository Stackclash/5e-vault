| 15 | Mote of Earth | When an earth elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clods of dirt that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialized containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).** | 100 gp | 1 lb | [Elemental Gem, Yellow Diamond](compendium/items/elemental-gem-yellow-diamond.md) |
| 20 | Myrmidon Shackles | Elementals are, by their nature, free and chaotic beings. It usually takes a lot of effort and powerful magic to trap them into a single form, and even more to bind them into service like one does with an elemental myrmidon. In fact, this magic is so strong, that it becomes reflected in the physical form of the elemental itself in the form of shackle-like armor around their wrists. These shackles have a number of uses due to the elemental magic infused into them, including reuse as binders for more elemental servants.<br /><br />**Use.** As a ranged attack, you may throw these shackles at an elemental that is size Large or smaller within 20 feet of you. On a successful hit, that elemental must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the shackles break and become useless. On a failure, the shackles bind to the elemental's form and the elemental becomes [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for 1 hour. While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, the elemental must obey your verbal commands to the best of its ability. If you do not issue any verbal commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If you or your companions damage the elemental, it may make the saving throw again, ending the charm on a success. Once the elemental is no longer [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), the shackles slip off them and may not be used again until the next dawn. | 285 gp | 6 lb | [Elemental Armlets](compendium/items/elemental-armlets-hhhviii.md) |
