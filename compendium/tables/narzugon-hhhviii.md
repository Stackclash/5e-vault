# Narzugon
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 33*

| 15 | Narzugon Eye (×2) | **.** The flaming-red eyes of a narzugon do not see the way they did when the narzugon was a mortal paladin. They are perceive more than the simple defraction of light, they are able to see into the very souls and hearts of the creatures around them, with the souls of the good shining like a beacon which draws the narzugon to them like a bull to a red cape. Through a basic ritual however, these eyes can be used to reverse this effect, and blind the forces of evil to the good creatures they wish to extinguish.<br /><br />**Use.** By burning an eye for 10 minutes in a flame that has had 10 gp of silver powder sprinkled into it, you mask all good-aligned creatures within 30 feet of the flame to the senses of evil-aligned creatures for the next hour. Evil-aligned creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to perceive masked creatures, and any attempt to divine a masked creature through magic such as the [scry](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell automatically fails. | 100 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Narzugon Heart | **.** The heart of a narzugon is a twisted one. While it may have once been redeemable with its sense of honor and duty, it has been filled with hate and scorn for mortal lives by the archdukes of the Nine Hells. However, it is these same qualities that make it extremely valuable as a resource, since these clashing qualities cascade into a magical energy that bolsters the resolve of the creatures around them when they gaze upon its sublime and stalwart presence.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may hold this heart aloft. If you do so, all allies within 60 feet of you can't be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of your next turn. Every time you use this item, roll a `dice: d20\|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, this item crumbles into dust and becomes worthless. | 780 gp | 3 lb | — |
| 25 | Narzugon Soul | The soul of a narzugon is a truly pitiable thing to behold. Although the nobility of their spirit is something to admire, they have become corrupted and blackened by the manipulations of the Nine Hells. Their literally undying commitment to servitude, however, makes their souls particularly good for infusion into armor, granting the wearer the narzugon's unholy strength and abilities. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 2,250 gp | 1 lb | [Plate of the Black Rider](compendium/items/plate-of-the-black-rider-hhhviii.md) |
