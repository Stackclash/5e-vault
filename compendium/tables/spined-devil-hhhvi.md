# Spined Devil
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 31* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Spine Devil Blood (vial) | The blood of the spine devil smells faintly of lantern oil and is responsible for the devil's fiery properties. Since the flammable enzymes are diluted in its blood, careful distillation needs to be performed before they can be repurposed into bombs and equipment. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [Fiend Fuel](compendium/items/fiend-fuel-hhhvi.md) |
| 15 | Spined Devil Spine (any the spine devil has remaining) | The spine devil's eponymous spines carry within them a magical charge that causes them to combust upon impact with their target. Removal thus must be done in a steady and methodical way so as to prevent accidental activation. Once harvested safely however, they may be re-fletched into arrowheads to make a particularly insidious arrowhead. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [Fire Arrow](compendium/items/fire-arrow-hhhvi.md) or [Fire Bolt](compendium/items/fire-bolt-hhhvi.md) |
