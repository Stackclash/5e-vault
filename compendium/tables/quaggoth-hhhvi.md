# Quaggoth
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 88* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Quaggoth Fur (small pouch) | Shaggy and coarse, it would not be immediately apparent that quaggoth fur has much use as anything except as a trophy. The fur however has remarkable insulation qualities, and while uncomfortable, can stuff a coat to keep an adventurer warm in even the deepest and darkest Underdark tunnel. | 1 gp | 4 lb | — |
| 10 | Quaggoth Blood (3 vials) | Due to their horrible Underdark diets, quaggoths have developed several enzymes and antibodies that make them immune to poisons. If used in an alchemy recipe, it creates a potion of poison resistance. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Poison Resistance](compendium/items/potion-of-poison-resistance.md) |
| 15 | Quaggoth Brain (Quaggoth Thonot only) | **.** The psionic energy of the Underdark occasionally causes mutations in the susceptible quaggoth population, creating what is known as a thonot. Their brains are noticeably larger and capable of psionic feats themselves. When eaten, these psionic abilities are temporarily bequeathed to the eater.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to eat this brain. For the next hour, you may cast the [feather fall](compendium/spells/feather-fall.md) and [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) spells at will without using a spell slot or requiring any spell components. | 6 gp | 5 lb | — |
