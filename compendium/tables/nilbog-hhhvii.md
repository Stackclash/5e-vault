# Nilbog
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 36* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Goblin Ear (×2) | Goblins neither possess much of value, nor are made of anything of value. Goblin ears are perhaps the only thing worth carving off of an average goblin, if only because dogs enjoy snacking on them the same way they enjoy pig ears. | 5 cp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Mirth Touched Smile | Even though a nilbog spirit abandons its physical host upon its defeat, it leaves its mark permanently in the form of a rictus grin on its old mouth. Mounting this macabre body part on a base of power can create an amusing novelty wand. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [Wand of Smiles](compendium/items/wand-of-smiles-xge.md) |
| 15 | Nilbog Echo | A nilbog's spirit is almost impossible to pin down for even the most skilled occultists. The most one can hope to do is catch an echo of it using a ream of spirit paper. This echo is almost as illusive and slippery as the real spirit, and dissipates too easily to be used for crafting, making it a strictly single use item.<br /><br />**Use.** If you cast the [sanctuary](compendium/spells/sanctuary.md) spell, you may expend this item as a material component instead of the usual material component. If you do so, the first time the creature protected by your [sanctuary](compendium/spells/sanctuary.md) spell receives damage from another creature, they may spend their reaction to reduce that damage to 0 and recover `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) hit points instead. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
