| 5 | Yurtrus Ichor (3 vials) | The rotting pus and viscera of a nurtured one of Yurtrus is absolutely packed with disease and plague. Luckily for most of us however, the disease cannot live long once exposed to the elements, and stops being a vector very soon after the death of its carrier. On the other hand, alchemists that have an interest in spreading maladies may make use of [enchanted vials](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md) to gather this ichor and brew it into a most insidious poison. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).** | 3 gp | 1 lb | [Cleric's Bane Poison](compendium/items/clerics-bane-poison-hhhvii.md) |
