| 10 | Ettin Fingernail | Like other giants, the fingernail sliver of an ettin is a key ingredient in the brewing of a [potion of giant strength](compendium/items/potion-of-giant-strength.md), in this case, acting as a stand in for a hill giant's. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [Potion of Hill Giant Strength](compendium/items/potion-of-hill-giant-strength.md) |
| 15 | Ettin Head (Ã—2) | Though ettins are often witnessed physically talking to their twinned head, their unique physiology causes their brains to share information subconsciously; a trait that can be exploited through clever artificing. Indeed, it is probably ironic that despite being among the dumbest beings on the Material Plane, ettins are capable of mental techniques that elude even the most prestigious of minds. | 80 gp | 25 lb | [Helm of Transmission](compendium/items/helm-of-transmission-hhhvi.md) |
