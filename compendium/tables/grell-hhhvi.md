# Grell
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 60* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Grell Tentacle (×2) | The formidable tentacles of a grell make fine whips once they are removed, dried, treated and fitted with a handle. Many Underdark societies have been seen using whips made from grells, for both their strength and their intimidation factor. | 3 gp | 5 lb | [+1 Whip](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 15 | Grell Poison (vial) | A grell's poison is known to paralyse hapless victims, leaving them helpless as the grell flies away with them to be devoured. By removing the gland located where its tentacles meet its body, this poison can be extracted and used against one's own enemies.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). The [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) target is [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), and it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. | 30 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Grell Hide | The hide of a grell is extremely sensitive to certain stimuli that completely bypasses the sense of most humanoids. Extremely difficult to remove intact, this hide can be used to craft armors that grant its wearer a sixth-sense similar to the grell's own. | 40 gp | 8 lb | [Grell Jerkin](compendium/items/grell-jerkin-hhhvi.md) |
