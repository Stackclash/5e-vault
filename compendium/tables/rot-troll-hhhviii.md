| 10 | Troll Blood (5 vials) | Famous for their regenerative ability, troll blood has widely been used as the basis for the ubiquitous [healing potion](compendium/items/potion-of-healing-gv-dmg.md). Indeed, troll blood is so potent that it can be diluted repeatedly and still deliver a healing effect. As such, it is usually used to mass produce the [basic version of the healing potion](compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md). | 7 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Greater Healing](compendium/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) |
| 15 | Troll Heart | The troll heart is one of the few organs in a troll's body that is not pledged to their terrible deity: Vaprak the Destroyer. As such, a troll heart is one of the few pieces of a troll that will not form a new troll around itself over time, and yet, its constant infusion of troll blood gives it some measure of regenerative ability which can be infused into an amulet for an ordinary humanoid to take advantage of. | 83 gp | 12 lb | Troll Amulet |
| 20 | Essence of Degeneration | A regenerating troll is particularly susceptible to the throes of necrotic energy which transform them into a lumbering mass of open sores and weeping wounds. Robbed of their regenerative abilities, the rot troll instead emits an aura of degeneration, harming all living creatures near it, and apparently making them more palatable to the trolls altered tastes. Captured in [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md), this aura can be released at your leisure, either as a handy trap, or a desperate last move. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may tear this item open, releasing the necrotic energy trapped within into yourself. For the next minute, all creatures within 5 feet of you take `dice:2d10\|noform\|avg` (`2d10`) necrotic damage at the end of each of your turns. | 700 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
