# Slithering Tracker
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 42* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Slithering Tracker Slime (vial) | Although it greatly resembles water, the semi-liquid that constitutes a slithering tracker's form is a different substance entirely. Although it deteriorates rapidly once the tracker has been defeated, keeping it in an [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md) allows for the salvaging of some of its magic for a potion later on. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).** | 9 gp | 1 lb | [Potion of Liquid Form](compendium/items/potion-of-liquid-form-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Echo of Vengeance | Even when they are defeated, a slithering tracker's lust for vengeance carries on. With a quick application of [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md), this gestalt field of emotion can be harvested and reused in a nefarious bit of magic. **Requires [spirit paper](compendium/items/spirit-paper-hhhvi.md).** | 30 gp | 1 lb | Curse of Vengance |
