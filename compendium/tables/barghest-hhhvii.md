# Barghest
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 8* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Barghest Blood (5 vials) | **.** The blood of a barghest is the same color as that of a goblin's, but has a slippery consistency more in line with that of a traditional yugoloth. It possesses some transformative properties as is befitting of its status as a shapeshifter.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to drink this blood. If you do so, you polymorph into a goblin version of yourself for the next hour. Your game statistics remain the same in your new form, except your size changes to Small. You revert to your normal form at the end of the hour, or if you die. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Barghest Fur (small bag) | **.** Barghests have an odd reaction to fire that transports them back to their home plane of Gehenna if they are engulfed in it for any period of time. This property extends to pristine samples of their fur, which can create a portal when used as tinder. Be warned though, that using said portal will still be quite painful. Alternatively, it can be used to make a macabre magical doll that is useful for goblin-based distractions.<br /><br />**Use.** If a small bag of barghest fur is thrown into a fire larger than 10 feet high or wide, the fur is instantly disintegrated and the fire transforms into a portal to a random location on the plane of Gehenna for the next minute, or until the fire is extinguished. Anything entering the portal automatically suffers `dice: 4d8\|avg` (`4d8`) fire damage from the heat of the original flame. | 13 gp | 3 lb | [Goblin Effigy](compendium/items/goblin-effigy-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Barghest Fang (×2) | The fangs of a barghest are magically imbued and capable of tearing a soul from a body the way normal fangs tear flesh from bone. While this may seem incomprehensibly evil, they may be refashioned into weapons that use that very same property to fight incorporeal undead, thus earning them a little bit of redemption. | 12 gp | 4 lb | [Soul Render](compendium/items/soul-render-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Barghest Stomach Acid (vial) | **.** Barghests possess an insidious ability befitting of a creature spawned from Gehenna: they are capable of devouring the souls along with the flesh of those they kill. While their teeth are responsible for the actual rending of soul from flesh, their stomachs are to blame for the destruction of the soul itself, their digestive fluids possessing an unholy property. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).**<br /><br />**Use.** If you pour this item onto a humanoid that has died within the past 10 minutes, that humanoid's soul will begin to be destroyed instead of passing into the afterlife. It takes 24 hours for a soul to be completely destroyed, after which no mortal magic may return that humanoid to life. If a resurrection attempt is made during those 24 hours, the attempt only has a 50% chance chance of success. Removing the acid from the body of the humanoid before the 24 hours is over halts the destruction of the soul. This item has enough stomach acid to destroy one soul, and stomach acid that has been used once may not be used again. | 60 gp | 2 lb | — |
