# Wood Woad
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 45* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 15 | Wood Woad Bark | Much harder than regular bark and suffused with ancient nature magic, this bark makes a wonderful set of natural armor. To harvest, it is best advised to use a sharp knife to make vertical strips down the abdomen of the wood woad, to make splints for later. | 15 gp | 30 lb | [Armor of the Forest Sentinel](compendium/items/armor-of-the-forest-sentinel-hhhvii.md) |
| 20 | Wood Woad Eye (×2) | The eyes of a wood woad are two sparkling motes of light and takes a particularly swift and practiced hand to extract and store before they dissipate. That said, they possess significant natural power, and have most likely seen more than most mortal creatures ever will. **Requires [enchanted vial](compendium/items/enchanted-vial-hhhvi.md).** | 28 gp | 1 lb | [Amulet of the Forest](compendium/items/amulet-of-the-forest-hhhvii.md) |
| 25 | Wood Woad Seed | Despite common belief, the walnut-sized seed extracted from a wood woad is not the same seed that was implanted in its original heart, and thus cannot be used to spawn a new wood woad. Instead, this seed acts more like a focus for the wood woad, and is able to redistribute its energy into the forest after it has been destroyed. In a way, this can be seen as the wood woad's last act of dutiful service.<br /><br />**Use.** If this seed is planted at least 1 foot deep into loamy, fertile soil, it will sprout into a magical tree over the course of 1 year. When fully grown, this magical tree stands at 30 feet tall and greatly resembles a sturdy oak. This magical tree acts as a protector of any surrounding forest area. If a humanoid attempts to harm a tree within 2 miles of the magical tree, they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or find themselves unable to willingly harm any living plant-life for 24 hours. In addition, plant-life that grows within 2 miles of the magical tree becomes noticeably stronger and grows at twice its normal rate. | 250 gp | 1 lb | — |
