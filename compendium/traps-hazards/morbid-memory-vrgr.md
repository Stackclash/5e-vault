# Morbid Memory
*Generic Hazard*  

A morbid memory trap presents little danger, but it proves useful in revealing important and unsettling glimpses into an area's past. This [haunted traps](/compendium/rules/variant-rules/haunted-traps-vrgr.md) affects a single room or 30-foot-square area. When a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as faint, disembodied whispers. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, an illusory scene plays out, repeating some terrible event that happened in the area. This vision typically lasts 1 minute. When the vision ends, all creatures in the area that saw the illusion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of the area for the next `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. [Frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creatures must take the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action and move away from the haunted area by the safest available route on each of their turns, unless there is nowhere else to move. After the haunted trap is activated, it won't activate again for 24 hours.
