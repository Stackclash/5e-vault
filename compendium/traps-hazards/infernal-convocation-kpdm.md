# Infernal Convocation
*Magical Trap*  

*Magic school: conjuration*

An infernal convocation is a way to use a conjuration in a trap. A powerful caster binds a fiend, which is summoned to a specific site when a trigger occurs. The fiend collects a second sacrifice—whoever triggered the trap—and is freed of its debt to the caster.

The trap is triggered as soon as a creature enters a magic circle, which can be inscribed on the wall or ceiling, or even woven into a carpet or limned on a cavern floor. There's no limit on the circle's size; horrific tales of lairs being encircled are told over campfires.

The purpose of the circle is deduced with a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. It can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check or a [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell (which renders it briefly inactive). If a creature that is not proficient in [Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana) gets a failure on either check, the trap is triggered and the fiend is summoned. An uncommon variant of the trap exists in which a [wall of force](compendium/spells/wall-of-force.md) spell traps both the prey and the summoned creature in the same area.
