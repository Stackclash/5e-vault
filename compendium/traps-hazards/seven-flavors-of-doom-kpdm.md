# Seven Flavors (of Doom)
*Magical Trap*  

*Magic school: evocation*

The number seven holds mystical importance in many civilizations, but only kobolds apply that veneration to their beloved art of trapmaking. The creation known as seven flavors is a deceptively simple trap in which eldritch needles spring from seven hidden tubes to strike a single target and release their charge.

The trap is detected with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. It can be disarmed only with [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md), though it can be avoided or rendered ineffective by blocking all seven holes. Each needle makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus. On a hit, a needle deals `dice:1d8+3|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d8 + 3`) damage of a different type from this list: lightning, fire, cold, acid, psychic, thunder, or necrotic.
