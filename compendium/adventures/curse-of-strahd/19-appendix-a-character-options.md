## Character Background

During character creation, players can select the following background for their characters, with your approval: [Haunted One](/compendium/backgrounds/haunted-one-vrgr.md). It is appropriate for any character or campaign associated with eeriness or horror.

## Gothic Trinkets

When rolling for a trinket, consider using the [Gothic Trinkets table](/compendium/items/trinket-cos.md), which is designed for a gothic game.
