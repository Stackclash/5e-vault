# Part 3: The Ruins of Castle Rend
*Source: The Siege of Castle Rend, p. 115* 

> [!quote] A quote from   
> 
> To the peasantry, goblins and orcs are "demons," meaning nothing more than fell spirits that live in the darkness of the wilds. But there is truth hidden in their folk wisdom, for Grole the OneHanded, Wargod of the Orcs, was once a Lord of Gehennom, a Demon Lord of Hell. But now he and his children call our world home.

Castle Rend was once a mighty stronghold of the Blue Dragon Phalanx, but those days are long past. The just law of the Good King has long since crumbled into tyranny and barbarism, just as the once-noble walls of Castle Rend have fallen into ruin.

The White Tusk orcs claimed Rend as their bastion two months ago. Their leader, Bonebreaker Dorokor, moved her nomadic clan into this forgotten keep after she accepted Lord Saxton's offer. She suspected the human would turn on the orcs as soon as they had outlived their usefulness. Her suspicions were vindicated when every bounty hunter from Bedegar to Dalrath suddenly began hunting for the orcs who slaughtered the Baron of Bedegar and his family. Yet she knows this situation cannot last long; her people will not submit to living in stone walls much longer. It is not the orcish way.

## Edmund and Dorokor

Dorokor keeps Edmund Bedegar prisoner in a comfortable room near her personal chambers. Comfortable by orcish standards, anyway. On his first day as prisoner, Edmund demanded to face Dorokor in single combat, claiming his right as a fellow chieftain. The other orcs laughed, but Dorokor peered at the young human with suspicion. Did he *know* orcs govern by right of combat? Or did he guess at it?

She indulged him, and stepped into the makeshift cage they created for him. Handing him a shortsword, she faced the young baron without a weapon of her own. A moment later, the boy was on his back, his sword flung far away, and Dorokor's boot on his chest. The boy would not yield. He sneered and spat at the bloodchief. The other orcs demanded his blood. But Dorokor knew she could not indulge them.

The young lordling had lost the combat but subtly outmaneuvered her. He forced her into a position where she *had* to kill him, but in order to preserve her plan, she could *not* kill him.

To the confusion of her tribe, she relented. Citing her plan to use the tiny human as a bargaining chip, she spared him. But she knew her orcs didn't like it. Now, she spends a few hours each day sparring with the young lord. She cannot explain why, even to her closest lieutenant.

> Keep it alive yes. Fed, we must. But train it? Teach it our battle ways? What is to be gained? Is it pity? Do you feel sorry for this pup?"
> 
> "I do not know, Oregg. I cannot say. Do not press me overmuch. Here, I am feeling my way. We are on unfamiliar terrain, and the world is not much with us since our bargain with Saxton."
> 
> "Your bargain."
> 
> "Aye, I admit it. But I think there is a path through this wood, and though I fumble like Grole with only one good hand, I think there is yet victory to be grasped. Indulge me in this. It is of little consequence in any event."

If the PCs try to kill their way through the orcs to rescue Pinna, Dorokor will not hesitate to threaten Edmund's life first, or Pinna's, and she means it. She will show some confusion at the PCs' tactics, as she believed that holding captives would force negotiations. The PCs don't know this, but Saxton originally captured Oregg Steeltwister and ransomed him back to Dorokor to force her to the negotiating table, where he pitched his plan.

In a sense, Dorokor is experimenting with civilization. Holding prisoners captive, seeking parley and negotiation. If this fails, if it even seems like it's going to fail, she is perfectly happy to go back to being a chaotic orc.

## Arrival

Read this aloud when the PCs first emerge from the forest and see Castle Rend.

> The trees and tall grass end, and the forest opens to a large clearing dominated by a ruined stone keep. This is the once-proud stronghold of the Blue Dragon Phalanx. A fortified wall surrounded this place long ago, but only the eastern and western sections remain intact. The entire upper level of the keep has collapsed. Two towers, one in the northwest, the other in the southeast, acted as lookouts once; now only the northwest tower remains intact. Time has ravaged this place.
> 
> The underbrush is clear for sixty feet surrounding the ruin, with lit torches placed every forty to fifty feet. The walls of the keep are as bare as the ground, not overgrown with choking vines

## Castle Rend General Features

This once proud dragon-knight stronghold is a shadow of its former glory. Its upper levels have all but completely collapsed, save for a single tower. The collapsed tower is filled with the restless spirits of the Blue Dragon knights that once claimed this keep, and its dungeons are filled with their cursed bones. The orcs stay away from those places.

The orcs captured some of the goblins native to the forest and press-ganged them into service, forcing them to dig pit traps in the keep's grounds and cut down trees, using this timber to reinforce the keep's crumbling architecture. After the goblins finished their labor, their orcish taskmasters executed them to prevent them from revealing the location of their hideaway. Only one, a squeamish runt named Glurpick, managed to escape. He fled for weeks, but after many trials he came into the presence of Sir Pelliton. The Star Knight keeps the goblin chained like a hound and has used him to help plan an attack on Castle Rend, which will be put into motion in Part 4: The Siege of Castle Rend (page 100).

### Ceilings

The keep's ceilings are 15 feet high unless otherwise noted. The dungeon's ceilings are more cramped at only 10 feet high.

### Doors

The keep's doors are unlocked by virtue of the original keys having been lost. The orcs have installed simple wooden bars to block doors they don't want opened. A creature must make a successful DC 17 Strength check to break down a barred door. Doors on the ground level of the keep are made of wood reinforced with iron, while doors on the dungeon level are made of stone.

### Floors

Castle Rend's flagstones are cracked and filled with moss. The White Tusk orcs removed some of these stones and excavated the foundation to create hidden pit traps by covering the hole with flimsy wooden planks covered in moss. A pit trap can be spotted by making a successful DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check while within 30 feet of the pit. If a creature weighing more than 50 pounds (including gear) steps on a pit trap, it must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall in. The pits are 30 feet deep and lined with wooden stakes. A creature that falls into a pit takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) piercing damage.

Pit traps are marked on the map of Castle Rend (next page) with a red "X."

### Light

Unless otherwise noted, all interior areas are pitch dark. The orcs don't need light to see, and this darkness gives them an edge against most assailants.

## The Daily Routine

The orcs live and work in the castle, preparing for war. They are always preparing for war. If the PCs spend hours or a day spying on the keep, possibly using [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) or wildshape to enter the castle undetected, they will witness the following cycle of events.

There are always 4 [orcs](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) in the watchtower. At any given time, at least half the orcs in the keep are awake.

### Morning

The orcs slaughter the game they hunted the previous evening. Dorokor wakes Edmund and they train in the sparring chamber. Orcs who participated in the hunt the previous night go to sleep.

### Afternoon

Other orcs use the sparring chamber for ritual combat, resolving grudges, or simple sport. Food is prepared for the evening feast.

### Evening

The orcs eat a huge meal at dusk in the great hall, and then sleep for a few hours, waking around midnight to hunt.

### Night

The orcs hunt game in the forest. Dorokor occasionally leads the hunt. Metalworkers pound old, scavenged shields, armor, and weapons into something usable.

## Castle Rend Exterior Locations

Castle Rend was built in a forest clearing, and its two watchtowers gave it an excellent view of the surrounding area in those days. Now that one tower is collapsed and filled with vengeful spirits, the orcs only have one tower from which to survey the area. If both were in use, the fortress would be all but impossible to sneak up on. However, in its current state, the PCs have two options: attempt to sneak past the orcish sentries surveilling the courtyard and risk alerting the orcs, or brave the dungeon and risk their lives.

### B1. Forest's Edge

Tall torches are staked into the ground at forty-foot intervals surrounding the perimeter of the castle. The grass is nearly three feet tall here, and creatures like halflings, gnomes, and wood elves can hide from the sentries in this natural cover by making a successful DC 11 Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. Taller creatures can crawl on their bellies, but have disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in this way. Characters that do not attempt to hide as they exit the tree line are trivially easy to spot by the orc sentries atop the guard tower (C13).

The eastern wall of the keep has completely collapsed, making it the easiest way to enter the castle's bailey.

### B2. Bailey

Castle Rend's bailey has largely been cleared of overgrowth by the orcs and their goblin slaves. The orcs have deposited the goblins' corpses unceremoniously into an unmarked grave on the west side of the courtyard. They've rotted there for nearly two weeks. Other refuse now fills the pit as well.

The orcs atop the guard tower (C13) do not watch the bailey unless alerted by noise from the courtyard. To cover this blind spot, the bailey is filled with pit traps, covered with thin planks of wood, with the wood covered in mud and grass. The pits do not have spikes, but the boards have affixed chimes made of bone and metal.

A creature that weighs more than 50 pounds (including its gear) falls into the pit if it steps on top of it, and must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, breaking the boards, ringing the chimes, and attracting the attention of the sentries. The pits are 20 feet deep, and a creature that falls into one takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

If the chimes ring or another loud noise is made in the bailey, the orc sentries turn to look. Any character in the bailey can use their reaction to fall to the ground and make a Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check with disadvantage. If the result of their check is greater than the result of the orcs' Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, the character escapes the orcs' notice, and the orcs look back toward the forest.

### B3. Main Gate

Castle Rend's main entrance is a thick gate of oak reinforced with bands of iron. An iron portcullis hangs over the gate, but its mechanism is rusted solid, and it can no longer be lowered by anything short of a successful DC 30 Strength check. The doors, however, have only weakened with age. They are barred from the inside, but can be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Whether this check succeeds or fails, the noise draws the attention of the orcs in the entrance hall (C3).

### B4. Secret Entrance

This trapdoor is overgrown with creeper vines and is unknown to the orcs. It conceals a long, winding staircase that leads into C25 within the castle basement.

## Castle Rend Interior Locations

Noise travels poorly within the plant-choked stone interior of Castle Rend. If a battle breaks out in any room within the castle, only creatures in adjacent areas connected by a doorway can hear the sound of combat. Even then, unless an orc calls for help or the PCs shout a phrase in a language other than Orc, the orcs simply assume that a brawl has broken out. The White Tusk does not fear dying for their chieftain; they only call for help if [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by supernatural means.

### C1. Entryway

The scent of dung and burnt flesh fills the entryway, wafting down the hall from the entrance hall (C3). The main doors to Castle Rend are barred from this side. By lifting the bar as an action, the doors can be opened at will. If these doors are forced open from the outside, the sound is clearly audible to creatures in areas C2a, C2b, and C3.

### C2. Guard Posts

Both of the guard posts (areas C2a and C2b) are unmanned. The orcs lack trained archers to make use of the arrow slits of the keep.

Area C2b also has a lever that controls the portcullis hanging above the castle's main doors. This lever cannot move right now, because the portcullis has rusted shut. Trying to force the rotted wooden lever just snaps it in half.

### C3. Entrance Hall

The largest chamber in Castle Rend is now breezy and moss-covered. Its carpets have been shredded by animal claws and rotted by water. A large bonfire burns in the center of this chamber, its smoke pouring out of a hole in the ceiling. Two [White Tusk juggernauts](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/white-tusk-juggernaut-saf.md) (see page 136) and their two [dire wolf](compendium/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md) pets sit around the fire, gnawing on large hunks of venison. The two juggernauts each carry a [potion of hill giant strength](compendium/items/potion-of-hill-giant-strength.md) brewed by the orc shamans in the cauldron room (C18), and each orc drinks their potion on their first turn in combat.

A treasure chest has been slid against the south wall of this chamber. It is surrounded by animal bones that have been gnawed clean by sharp fangs. This treasure chest is actually a [mimic](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md) that the orcs found and now keep as a pet. It contains 500 gp worth of sapphires inside its gullet.

#### Developments

This room is connected to many others, so creating a disturbance here causes the orcs in adjacent rooms to investigate. If it is sundown, Bonebreaker Dorokor, Oregg Steeltwister, Pinna, and Edmund Bedegar are likely dining in the Great Hall (C8). [Bonebreaker Dorokor](compendium/bestiary/npc/bonebreaker-dorokor-saf.md) and [Oregg Steeltwister](compendium/bestiary/npc/oregg-steeltwister-saf.md) (page 135) attack on sight, suspecting that the characters are Lord Saxton's thugs. Pinna and Edmund hold back and come to investigate on the second round of combat, but if Pinna recognizes the characters from Gravesford, she screams for both sides to stop fighting. See the Negotiating with Orcs event (page 125).

#### Treasure

Each of the juggernauts carries a coin pouch filled with 10 gp. If they were killed before they could drink their potion, each also carries a [potion of hill giant strength](compendium/items/potion-of-hill-giant-strength.md).

### C4. Chapel

This chapel was consecrated to St. Gaed the Confessor in the days of the Blue Dragon Phalanx, also known as the Blue Dragonflight. In the middle of the chamber, a shrine to the saint stands with arms outstretched. However, the statue has been desecrated by the orcs. St. Gaed's noble visage is defaced and warped into that of a snarling orc—the image of Grole, the orc god of slaughter and domination.

This affront angered the spirits of the Blue Dragon Phalanx that once protected this fortress, and they rose in anger against the orcs. Their spirits now occupy parts of the dungeon and the collapsed tower—and this chamber! If a creature touches the statue, an electric shock runs through its hand, like static. The room then grows colder and darker. The eyes of the statue begin to bleed, and a ghastly voice rasps, "No living creature shall defile our castle further. Die."

A [wraith](compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) emerges from the floor and attacks the creature who touched the statue. It retreats into the floor once all creatures that were present when it appeared leave the room.

#### Breaking the Curse

The curse of undeath placed upon this keep can be broken if the chapel is reconsecrated to St. Gaed. Father Belderone from Gravesford can perform a ritual of reconsecration if given 24 hours and 500 gp with which to purchase incense, sacred unguents, and [holy water](compendium/items/holy-water-flask.md). Casting [hallow](compendium/spells/hallow.md) within this chamber will also set the undead to rest, though that spell is likely beyond the PCs' ability to cast.

#### Secret

A character that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices that the statue is standing on a wooden floor tile. If the statue is moved, a trapdoor is revealed. This trapdoor leads to the knights' crypt (C21).

### C5. Sparring Chamber

Knights once sparred in this chamber, but all the archery targets have rotted away. The White Tusk orcs still use it as a training chamber, and sometimes Bonebreaker Dorokor and Edmund Bedegar spar here. Dorokor has some sense of mercy, but only enough to keep her blows from outright killing "the boy with no hide," as the orcs call him. Edmund has never won a match but has dozens of cuts and bruises to show for his efforts.

Four [orcs](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) spar here.

#### Treasure

About two dozen sets of orcish armor and crude weapons are haphazardly stored along the perimeter of this room. A character that makes a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or takes 5 minutes to search the armor finds a well-kept suit of [studded leather armor](compendium/items/studded-leather-armor.md) and a shining [+1 rapier](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) with the Bedegar coat of arms inscribed on the pommel.

### C6. Armory

The Blue Dragonflight stored their weapons and armor here. None of the armor fits the orcs, and most of it is rusty and corroded by time and water. The crest of the dragon knights is still visible on the chest pieces of the plate armor, though.

Twelve suits of plate armor stand around the walls of this room. Eleven are rusted and pitted, but one still seems to gleam silver, as if it had been polished mere moments ago. This suit of [+1 plate](compendium/items/1-armor.md) belonged to Raizorojan, Captain of the Blue Dragon Phalanx, and fits a human with a broad, athletic build. Other creatures will need to have it refitted. Touching the suit of magical plate causes eight of the rusty suits of armor to creak to life as [animated armor](compendium/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) and attack the pillagers until they all leave the room. These enchanted suits of armor have Strength (`dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)`) Strength; their slam attacks have a Slam (`dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)`) bonus to hit and deal `dice:2d6+4|noform|avg|text(2d6 + 4)|text(11)` (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage on a hit. These changes increase their challenge rating to 2 (450 XP).

### C7. Coatroom

This room once held the ceremonial attire of the knights and had room for guests to hang their coats. All within has been reduced to muck and tattered cloth.

#### Treasure

Digging through the mold and muck for 5 minutes will yield gold buttons, lapis lazuli cufflinks, and sapphire earrings worth a total of 300 gp.

### C8. Great Hall

A stately marble dining table stands before a cold hearth in the center of the great hall. Twelve stone chairs are assembled around it, though all have been chipped, covered with plants, or knocked over. Every night at sunset, Bonebreaker Dorokor sups here with her lieutenant, Oregg Steeltwister, as well as Edmund Bedegar and Pinna. Lately, they have been planning how best to conduct negotiations with the people of Gravesford.

If the PCs interrupt this meal, [Bonebreaker Dorokor](compendium/bestiary/npc/bonebreaker-dorokor-saf.md) and [Oregg Steeltwister](compendium/bestiary/npc/oregg-steeltwister-saf.md) (page 135) both leap over the table and attack instantly, suspecting that the PCs are assassins sent by Lord Saxton. If Pinna recognizes them from Gravesford, she instantly calls for everyone to stop fighting. See the Negotiating with Orcs event (page 125).

At other times of day, this chamber is usually empty. Orcs can pass through it to get from the barracks to the watchtower when changing guard shifts (see C13).

### C9. Barracks

The orcs have repurposed the Blue Dragonflight's barracks as their own. Areas 9a, 9b, and 9c each contain four bunks. Area 9d has been converted into a holding chamber for Edmund Bedegar and, more recently, Pinna. Young Lord Bedegar has helped soothe the hedge mage's nerves after being kidnapped.

Area 9e belongs to Bonebreaker Dorokor, and its door is decorated with an ornate crest of snapped bones, with an eagle's skull in the center. Her large chamber contains items unusual for an orc, such as a washbasin, parchment, and charcoal. Dorokor has no use for human fineries, and everything within her chamber is worthless by human standards, save for her magical greataxe, [Wound](compendium/items/wound-saf.md) (see [Bonebreaker Dorokor](compendium/bestiary/npc/bonebreaker-dorokor-saf.md), page 141). She keeps this mighty weapon on her person at all times, and rests it at the foot of her cot while she sleeps.

Area 9f belongs to Oregg Steeltwister, second-in-command of the White Tusk clan. He possesses none of Dorokor's cunning or subtlety, but he is madly in love with her. He follows her every order and pretends to understand her schemes in order to win her favor.

### C10. Kitchen

This kitchen once produced fabulous meals for the Blue Dragon knights. Now, it is manned solely by whichever [orc](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) is on mess duty for the day. Game is plentiful in the Forest Rend, and the kitchen is covered in dried animal blood, with the carcasses of deer and wild boars hanging from the ceiling on improvised meat hooks. The orcs have no desire to eat anything but raw meat, so their cook is little more than a butcher.

The orc manning the kitchen today is a coward named Greevil. He does not attack on sight like other orcs, but instead tries to hide when the PCs enter this room. A successful DC 10 Charisma ([Intimidation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check can convince him to do the PCs' dirty work, so long as it doesn't involve directly acting against Bonebreaker Dorokor or Oregg Steeltwister. He will tell the heroes about Edmund, or about Dorokor's plan and her desire to parley with the humans, or about the layout of the keep, but he won't disobey Dorokor or attack her or any other orc.

### C11. Larder

The orcs do not store or preserve their food, and what provisions remained here have spoiled and rotted away.

### C12. Tower Stairs

A stone spiral staircase winds up into the watchtower and down into the stronghold's basement. Characters trying to climb the stairs quietly must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. If the passive Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) of every character is higher than 10, they automatically succeed on this check. If they fail this check or do not attempt to ascend the staircase quietly, all four [orcs](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) in C13 hear their approach and [ready](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Ready) an action to attack the next non-orc creature they see.

### C13. Watchtower

Four [orcs](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) stand guard at this fifty-foot-tall watchtower at all times, looking down upon the forest surrounding Castle Rend. A stone brazier holds faintly burning embers for staving off the cold during the night. They pass the time by telling rude jokes.

If attacked in melee, they try to [grapple](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Grapple) their attackers and hurl them from the tower.

### C14. Collapsed Tower

The collapsed south tower is a place of great suffering. Those who once inhabited this castle—the tormented souls of King Omund's knights and priests of St. Gaed the Confessor—keep constant vigil in this tower, and no orc dares enter it. On moonless nights, a spectral flame burns atop its ruined crenellations.

This tower holds a staircase that climbs to its ruined top and descends into C25 of the keep's dungeons. Climbing the staircase leads to a dead end where the tower has caved in, and any creature who sifts through the rubble must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw as the [ghost](compendium/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of one of the knights emerges through the wall and uses its Possession ability on them. The ghost fights until it is destroyed.

Sifting through the rubble for 5 minutes reveals a rusted iron lockbox, which is trivial to force open. Inside is an airtight pewter [scroll case](compendium/items/map-or-scroll-case.md) embellished with silver images of dragons. Inside the case is a small key and a piece of [parchment](compendium/items/parchment-one-sheet.md): the deed to this keep, signed by Omund himself. The deed is a historical curiosity, but since both King Omund and the Blue Dragonflight are now little more than a memory, the deed is practically useless in this day and age. That is, unless someone convincing and charismatic decided to keep it and declare it valid under the principle that Omund's proclamation was never lawfully rescinded. The scroll case could be sold to a jeweler for 300 gp.

The key within this scroll case is small, made of silver, and embellished with an image of a dragon. It opens the treasure chests in C19 within the dungeon.

## Castle Rend Dungeon Locations

The dungeons of Castle Rend contain the sleeping quarters of the White Tusk clan's lowliest grunts, but they are also home to the clan's shrine to Grole, the clan's warspeakers, and their shamans. Some putrid smell and the acrid stench of smoke fills the dungeons—the orcs' shamans are brewing something foul down here, and there is hardly any ventilation. The stink doesn't bother the orcs, but PCs that enter the dungeon level must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour by the smell. If a PC succeeds on this save, they become immune to being [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way for 24 hours.

### C15. Prison-Barracks

This room was once a prison, but the White Tusk orcs have converted it into barracks for their lowliest grunts.

Whichever [orc](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) is on watch duty for the night rests here with 2 [dire wolves](compendium/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md) at his side. Any combat here instantly draws the attention of any orcs in areas C16a-d and awakens any that are asleep. A poisoned [dagger](compendium/items/dagger.md) rests on the orc's bedside table. The orc throws this dagger at an enemy on his first turn in combat. On a hit, the target takes the dagger's `dice:1d4+3|noform|avg|text(normal damage)` (`1d4+3`) and must also make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:9d6|noform|avg|text(9d6)|text(31)` (`9d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Treasure

A small treasure chest is stowed beneath the sentry's bed. It is unlocked and contains a vial of deadly poison. There is enough left to coat one weapon. The next time the poisoned weapon deals damage to a creature, it must also make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:9d6|noform|avg|text(31)` (`9d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### C16. Barracks-Cells

Each of these four rooms contains a bunk that fits two orcs (in fairly cramped conditions). During the day, these orcs are off hunting or patrolling the forest. At night, their inhabitants sleep here. The barred doors of these cells have been ripped off their hinges and lie strewn around the hallway.

Each cell's occupants are:

### C17. Warspeakers' Cloister

Two [White Tusk warspeakers](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/white-tusk-warspeaker-saf.md) of Grole have made this spacious chamber their home. While they tend to the shrine (C23) during the day, they return here to sleep after nightfall. One has cast an [alarm](compendium/spells/alarm.md) spell on this room in case one of the common orcs is foolish enough to try to steal from them, and both warspeakers come running from the shrine if the spell is triggered.

#### Treasure

Each warspeaker keeps a small chest containing 100 gp underneath their cot. Additionally, one has a stack of three stone tablets that function like [spell scrolls](compendium/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md). Only creatures that can read Orc can use these stone scrolls of [bestow curse](compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md), [shield of faith](compendium/spells/shield-of-faith.md), and [spiritual weapon](compendium/spells/spiritual-weapon.md).

### C18. Cauldron Room

Here, two [White Tusk shamans](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/white-tusk-shaman-saf.md) brew a foul-smelling concoction in a cauldron suspended over a bed of smoldering embers. On the first turn of combat, one of the shamans uses its Spirit-Bonded Body trait to transform into a [wolf](compendium/bestiary/beast/wolf.md) and howl loudly as an action. This howling alerts all orcs in the dungeon level to the presence of intruders, so they can't be surprised for the next hour. Additionally, all orcs in areas C15, C16, C17, and C20 come to investigate the disturbance, ready for battle.

#### Treasure

The cauldron contains a potion that the shamans are brewing to aid their bloodchief in the trials to come. This pungent broth is the base for a [potion of enhance ability](compendium/items/potion-of-enhance-ability-saf.md). It is currently inert, but its magical effects can be activated by adding a single hair or feather of a certain animal to a vial of this potion. There is enough broth in this cauldron to fill six glass vials. A crate containing twelve [vials](compendium/items/vial.md) sits in a corner of this room.

### C19. Secret Treasury

The White Tusk orcs have not discovered the secret vault in which the Blue Dragonflight stored their spoils. A secret door disguised to look like the masonry of the hallway protects this vault. However, a creature within 30 feet of the secret door that makes a successful DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check will notice that the cauldron-smoke filling the dungeon is filtering through a tiny crack at the top and bottom of a five-foot section of wall. The secret door can be demolished by making a successful DC 17 Strength check. Otherwise, its hidden lock can be found by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check and then picked by making a successful DC 17 Dexterity check with [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md).

Within the chamber is a small, uncorrupted shrine to St. Gaed the Confessor. A silver chalice worth 100 gp rests on it, filled with divine mead that has stayed fresh through the ages. A cleric, druid, or paladin that drinks of this holy mead restores 1 expended spell slot.

The larger room to the west of this shrine contains four treasure chests, each locked and trapped with a poison needle trap. Opening a chest without the proper key (found in the scroll case in area C14) causes a needle to spring out from the lock three inches, delivering a dose of poison. A pricked creature takes 1 piercing damage and `dice:2d10|noform|avg|text(11)` (`2d10`) poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. A character who makes a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check will deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. The needle can be removed from the lock, disarming the trap, by making a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md). Failing to pick the lock triggers the trap.

Each chest contains `dice:500+10d6|noform|avg` (`500 + 10d6`) gp and `dice:50+1d10|noform|avg` (`50 + 1d10`) pp.

### C20. Refuse Pit

The orcs have dug a small pit to throw their waste into. Its stench is rank.

### C21. Crypt of the Blue Dragon Knights

This solemn chamber contains the remains of the knights that once protected this land. Ten rows of stone sarcophagi form a sepulchral procession down this hall. The leader of the knights lingers here within his sarcophagus on the far west wall of the room as a [wraith](compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md), who vengefully attacks any creature that enters his domain. He speaks Common and is willing to discuss cleansing the shrine of St. Gaed and being set to rest—he demands that the orcs be permanently driven out of the keep before the shrine is reconsecrated—but will only negotiate if the PCs initiate. Otherwise, he attacks indiscriminately.

At the start of each round of combat while in the crypt, two [specters](compendium/bestiary/undead/specter.md) rise from graves until all 18 specters have risen, threatening to overwhelm the PCs through sheer numbers. All of the undead disperse instantly if the wraith is killed or if the PCs flee this chamber.

#### Treasure

Within the wraith's sarcophagus is his holy sword, [Grace](compendium/items/grace-saf.md) (page 144). Another sarcophagus holds the dust of another knight and the [Armor of St. Gaed the Confessor](compendium/items/armor-of-st-gaed-the-confessor-saf.md) (page 144).

### C22. Tower Stairs

A stone spiral staircase winds up to the main floor of the keep (C12), and then farther up still to the watchtower (C13).

### C23. Shrine to Grole

The warspeakers of the White Tusk clan created a new shrine to Grole after they realized their error in defiling the statue of St. Gaed in the upper levels. The shrine to Grole in the dungeons is little more than a stone slab covered in carved bone trinkets, but it is enough to satisfy Bonebreaker Dorokor.

Two [White Tusk warspeakers](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/white-tusk-warspeaker-saf.md) tend to this shrine. They allow their fellow orcs to pray at this shrine, but attack invaders on sight.

#### Treasure

A fist-sized sapphire rests on the shrine, a shining stone that one of the warspeakers found while exploring the dungeons. A character that makes a successful DC 22 Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check discerns that this stone is actually the crystallized heart of a sapphire dragon, and it is probably about a hundred years old. As a stone, it would sell for about 400 gp, but as a magical relic, a wizard would easily buy it for 1,000 gp. It also functions as a medium [psionic crystal](compendium/items/psionic-crystal-saf.md) (page 260).

### C24. Secret Escape Route

The hidden passage from B4 in the castle courtyard leads to a long, earthen tunnel that winds downward into this hidden room—a secret back exit for a castle under siege. Long ago, it contained a fully stocked emergency larder and armory, but everything inside has long since rotted or corroded. The orcs know nothing of this secret room, making it a perfect place to rest.

The secret door is clearly marked from this side, but blends into the wall when viewed from the hallway. A creature within 30 feet of the secret door that makes a successful DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check will notice the cauldron-smoke that fills the dungeon is filtering through a tiny crack at the top and bottom of a fivefoot section of wall. The secret door can be demolished by a successful DC 17 Strength check, or by finding its hidden lock by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check and then picking the lock with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check with [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md).

### C25. Collapsed Tower Stairs

These stairs lead upward to the collapsed tower (C14).

## Castle Rend Event: Negotiating with Orcs

When the PCs meet with [Bonebreaker Dorokor](compendium/bestiary/npc/bonebreaker-dorokor-saf.md), she announces: "I am Bonebreaker Dorokor, Bloodchief of the White Tusk. I hold [Wound](compendium/items/wound-saf.md). If you are servants of the human Saxton, you will die quickly and painfully."

Facing an orc with two humans hostage, the heroes may just attack. Typical. But if they negotiate with her, she agrees to parley. She demands that the PCs set down their arms and join her at the table. She snarls at Edmund and Pinna to not speak out of turn, and the two meekly oblige. Edmund sits on Dorokor's left, Pinna sits on Edmund's left, and Oregg Steeltwister sits on Dorokor's right.

As part of negotiations, Dorokor explains the situation:

- Lord Saxton kidnapped one of Dorokor's own and arranged a meeting. She was given a sum of gold to kill the Baron of Bedegar and his family so that Lord Saxton could become regent.  
- She spared the life of Edmund Bedegar and stole him away just in case Saxton stabbed her in the back. (Spoiler: he did.)  
- She wishes to return the boy to human lands and reveal Saxton's treachery so that he may be deposed. However, she has terms she needs met, and she no longer trusts the honor of "civilized folk."  

Dorokor is willing to return both Pinna and Edmund and quit the field, leaving the castle with her tribe—especially if she believes the PCs will use Edmund to expose Saxton's treachery (this is, after all, her entire plan). But in order to maintain her control over the clan, Dorokor must come out ahead in these negotiations, and no amount of promises will do the trick. She needs to show the orcs under her leadership that she is stronger than these humans *and that the humans know it*. Only an item of power will suffice.

The flip side of this is that the orcs don't really know what counts as "an item of power," so they can be fooled a little. But Bonebreaker Dorokor is harder to fool. If the PCs are sufficiently persuasive, she'll accept a lesser item and play it up to her tribe as though it's a triumph.

Otherwise, she demands a powerful magic item—a rare or rarer magic weapon (like the holy sword [Grace](compendium/items/grace-saf.md) found in C21) would do the trick. As a rule of thumb, the PCs' single most valuable possession is enough to all-but-instantly secure a successful negotiation.

If this negotiation goes well, Dorokor snarls a wide smile. "Take the boy. Take the girl. Take this stone house too, if you wish. Walls are for keeping cattle and pigs. We care not for such things—you can have it. But kill Saxton. He is too treacherous to lead men, and too weak to survive out here. If you agree to this, the White Tusk clan will return to the hills in the north and trouble you no more."

If the negotiations go *exceptionally well*, Dorokor produces a hollowed ram's horn from her belt and hands it to the PCs. "I do not give Men gifts lightly. We have a common enemy: Saxton and his vermin. If you blow the horn, my clan will answer so long as we can hear it."

If negotiations stall or turn sour, Dorokor puts her hostage to work. She grabs Edmund by the neck and levels [Wound](compendium/items/wound-saf.md) at his throat. "Meet my demands or your true bloodchief dies. And the girl too. You must swear it. Swear with something stronger than your worthless honor." It is clear from the look in her eyes and the edge in her voice that Dorokor never makes empty threats.

If the PCs can't agree on how to negotiate with Dorokor, then it's initiative. If they fail to beat her in the initiative order, she executes Edmund. Or just slits his throat and leaves him for dead, so a PC cleric can heal him later, depending on what kind of GM you are. 😃

If they succeed in negotiating with her, she takes her tribe and leaves in the night, without bothering with sentimental goodbyes.
