# Scavenger
*[Rogue](rogue.md): Roguish Archetype*  
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 116*  


## Class Features

### Scavenger (Level 3)

Very few Scavenger rogues chose to follow this archetype; usually this path is chosen out of desperation rather than desire. Formed from the bottom rungs of civil society or in the most inhospitable places in the wilds, Scavengers fend for themselves by making the most of whatever the fates see fit to give them. They survive by remaining on the fringes, striking out only when they spot an easy kill or a safe meal. Their methods of survival are seen by most people as crass and opportunistic, but these criticisms matter little to them: all that matters is that they survive.

### Cut and Run (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you learn to minimise danger by darting in and out of battle. Whenever you use your [Sneak Attack](compendium/classes/rogue.md#Sneak%20Attack%20(Level%201)) feature against a target, you regain all expended speed you may have used that turn.

### Waste Not Want Not (Level 3)

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to salvage materials that most harvesters would consider ruined. If you fail a "harvesting" check to harvest a material, you may immediately attempt that check again at disadvantage. On a success, you successfully harvest that material, but it is worth only half of its normal monetary value. This feature may only be used once per creature you attempt to harvest.

### Pick the Bones (Level 9)

At 9th level, your senses become supremely honed for finding resources and opportunities that others may miss. You have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) and Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks and during combat you may perform them as bonus actions.

### Circle the Weak (Level 13)

At 13th level, you gain an instinct for manoeuvring yourself around the weak and vulnerable. Whenever a creature you can see within 60 feet of you becomes [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained), or [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), you may immediately use your reaction to move up to half your speed in any direction. At the end of this movement, if that creature is within range of an attack by you, you may also make an attack against them as part of this movement.

### Eye for Opportunity (Level 17)

Starting at 17th level you learn to take advantage of even the smallest distractions, granting you more ways to use your [opportunity attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#opportunity%20attack). In addition to the normal triggers, you may also use your [opportunity attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#opportunity%20attack) against creatures within 5 feet of you under any of the following circumstances:

- One of your allies hits that creature with a critical hit.  
- That creature becomes [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).  
- That creature is reduced to less than half its maximum hit points for the first time this combat.
