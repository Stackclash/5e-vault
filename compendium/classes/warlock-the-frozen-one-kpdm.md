## Class Features

### The Frozen One (Level 1)

Your patron is the embodiment of winter. This is typically a god associated with winter or cold, but powerful ice maidens, ice devils, and other creatures associated with the cold can serve as patrons.

Your patron seeks to immerse the world in eternal winter or bring about some similar fate. While you may not share this goal, you have sworn fealty to this being and you act as its agent to spread winter wherever you roam.

### Expanded Spell List (Level 1)

The Frozen One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you:

**The Frozen One Expanded Spells**

| Spell Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| 1st | [create or destroy water](compendium/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md), [fog cloud](compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) |
| 2nd | [blur](compendium/spells/blur.md), [ice hammer](compendium/spells/ice-hammer-kpdm.md) |
| 3rd | [protection from energy](compendium/spells/protection-from-energy.md) (cold only), [sleet storm](compendium/spells/sleet-storm.md) |
| 4th | [ice storm](compendium/spells/ice-storm.md), [wintry glide](compendium/spells/wintry-glide-kpdm.md) |
| 5th | [cone of cold](compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md), [ice fortress](compendium/spells/ice-fortress-kpdm.md) |

### Deflective Ice (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you can bring a small chunk of ice to your aid. As a reaction when a creature makes a weapon attack against you, the ice shields you from the attack. The creature has disadvantage on its attack roll. Regardless of the result of the attack, the ice melts away immediately afterward. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Frozen Path (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, as part of your move for 1 turn, you can leave a layer of ice on the ground along your path. This ice persists for 1 minute. A creature other than you that enters a space of ice must make a successful Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) in that space. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Icy Body (Level 10)

Beginning at 10th level, your skin takes on an icy sheen. You are immune to cold damage, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks you make to escape from being grappled.

### Wintry Blast (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, you can designate a creature you see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If it fails, it feels numbing cold emanating from your patron. The creature takes `dice:10d10|noform|avg` (`10d10`) cold damage and must make another Constitution saving throw. If the second saving throw fails, the creature is also [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for 1 minute. A [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the restraint on a success. You must complete a short or long rest before using this feature again.
