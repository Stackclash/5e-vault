## Class Features

### Alkemancer (Level 2)

Wizards who combine traditional spellcasting with advanced alchemical practices and concoctions are called alkemancers. They are a mysterious breed sometimes confused with transmuters, with whom they share a complicated rivalry.

### Wizard Specialty (Level 2)

Unlike many transmuters, who focus on the physical transformation of objects and creatures, alkemancers are concerned with the search for human perfection and immortality, and they use alchemy as a means in this pursuit. Still, there is much crossover between the two specialties. Alkemancers and transmuters can be found working toward the same goals, as both allies and rivals.

Alkemancy spells typically blend conjuration, necromancy, and transmutation effects. Few alkemancy spells belong to the schools of evocation or illusion, since spells of these schools summon energy out of nothingness or create things that are not real; both concepts are at odds with the precepts of alkemancy, which seeks to reduce energy and matter to its constituent parts and refine them to a more purified (or useful) state of existence.

Except as noted below, alkemancers function as wizards and use the wizard spell list.

### Alchemical Savant (Level 2)

Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an alkemancy spell into your spellbook are halved.

When you gain a level, one of the two spells you learn for gaining a level can be an alkemancy spell even if you've never encountered the spell before. Similarly, when you learn a new cantrip, it can be an alkemancy cantrip even if you've never previously encountered it.

### Skilled Alchemist (Level 2)

Beginning at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with alchemical supplies if you did not already have it and your proficiency bonus with alchemical supplies is doubled. You also halve the cost of alchemical items you create, enabling you to fashion most basic items in a single day. Finally, you gain proficiency with alchemical weapons, and you add your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls when you use them as weapons.

### Essence Mastery (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, you can add one of the six fundamental essences to your spells as an additional material component at the cost of 1 gp per spell level. This doesn't increase the casting time of the spell or any of its other effects except as follows.

- Adding brimstone to a spell that deals fire damage causes the flames to take on a bluish hue and to release irritating vapors. A creature damaged by the spell must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).  
- Adding lead to a spell that improves your armor class, such as mage armor or shield, increases the spell's AC bonus by 2. If the spell has a duration longer than 1 round, the duration also increases by a number of additional rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Any visible spell effect modified with lead takes on a dull gray sheen.  
- Adding quicksilver to a spell that changes the form of a creature or an object, such as alter self or polymorph, increases the spell's duration by a number of minutes equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Spells with a duration briefer than 10 minutes, such as alchemical form, measure the increase in rounds instead of minutes. Any change in form modified with quicksilver is always accompanied by lustrous wisps or motes of silvery energy.  
- Adding quintessence to a necromantic spell that grants temporary hit points, such as false life or life hack, increases the temporary hit points gained by a number equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). Adding quintessence to a spell doesn't change the spell's visible aspects.  
- Adding salt to a spell that deals acid damage gives the acid a pale, crystalline hue and causes it to become extremely painful. Any creature damaged by the spell must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) points from its Strength and Dexterity scores (rolled separately). These lost points return automatically after a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).  
- Adding void salt to a spell that deals necrotic damage causes the spell to shed palpable strands of darkness. Any creature damaged by the spell is also surrounded by a veil of cloying shadows and must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).  

### Craft Minor Elixir (Level 10)

Beginning at 10th level, you automatically learn the formulas for a number of elixirs, oils, philters, or potions of your choice equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You do not need to spend time or gold researching these formulas.

When brewing an elixir, oil, philter, or potion based on one of the formulas you obtained, you can add exotic alchemical reagents to the mixture at the cost of additional gold equal to half the potion's standard cost. If you do this, the resulting mixture is more powerful than normal: if the potion has an instantaneous effect (such as potions of healing), it automatically has its maximum effect; if the potion has a duration (such as a potion of giant strength), it lasts for twice its normal duration.

### Path of the Golden Glower (Level 14)

Beginning at 14th level, you learn the secret formulas for brewing the fabled [Six Elixirs](compendium/items/the-six-elixirs-kpdm.md), magical draughts of incredible potency and rarity. Each elixir takes a full year or more to create from exceedingly rare ingredients, but once finished and consumed or otherwise applied, each grants its user a permanent bonus of some sort.

Additionally, once you reach 14th level, you become so skillful at working with dangerous chemicals and reagents that you gain resistance to acid and poison damage and are immune to the [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.
