# Butcher
*[Fighter](fighter.md): Martial Archetype*  
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 112*  


## Class Features

### Butcher (Level 3)

Swish, swish, thunk. Swish, swish, thunk. These are the sounds of a butcher at work, swinging their tools through the air as they dismember and disembowel their raw materials. For a butcher, their tools are an extension of their own bodies, akin to the claws and fangs of a predator that allow them to rip through the flesh of their prey.

While many think lowly of butchers, few can appreciate the combination of brute strength, steady hands, and anatomical knowledge that it requires. After all, any animal can hack away at a piece of meat, but it takes a trained artisan to create the surgical cuts needed for this craft. The best butchers take pride in partaking in every aspect of preparing a carcass, including its creation by hunting and slaughtering the creature. These fighters launch themselves eagerly into battle, always enticed by the thought of fresh meat.

### Tools of the Trade (Level 3)

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your weapons the way you use your butcher's tools, creating a new range of techniques unseen by most other combatants. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may choose to add an additional effect from one of the following, depending on what type of damage your weapon dealt. Each effect also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses upon finishing a short or long rest.

If an effect requires your target to make a saving throw, the DC is calculated as 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus.

### Anatomical Precision (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, due to your extensive knowledge of creature anatomy you have advantage on "Harvest" checks made to harvest beasts, dragons, giants, humanoids, and monstrosities. In addition, damage inflicted by your weapons do not contribute to ruining a creature's carcass under the "particularly violent deaths rule".

### Gruesome Blow (Level 7)

Starting at 7th level, you learn to combine your strength and bodily perception to make debilitating strikes that hamper your enemy's ability to function. If you score a critical hit on a melee weapon attack against a creature, that creature can't take reactions and can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn regardless of its abilities or magic items until the start of your next turn. In addition, if they are concentrating on a spell at the time of being hit, that concentration immediately ends.

### Butcher's Rhythm (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, you become able to fight with the same methodical rhythm you use when carving a carcass on your table. If you make a successful weapon attack against a creature, your next weapon attack against that creature this turn is made with advantage so long as you do not move or take any other action or bonus action before making that attack.

### Walking Slaughterhouse (Level 15)

At 15th level, you become so skilled with your butchering tools that you can wield them in both hands with ease. You gain the following benefits:

- You wield all melee weapons as if they had the light property.  
- You are able to wield melee weapons with the two-handed property in one hand with no penalty.  
- You are always considered to be using two hands when wielding weapons, even when holding them in one hand.  

### Improved Tools of the Trade (Level 18)

Each effect improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.
