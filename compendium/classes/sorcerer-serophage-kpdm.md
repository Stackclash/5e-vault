## Class Features

### Serophage (Level 1)

Some sorcerers are preoccupied with blood, both their own and that of others.

### Sorcerous Origin (Level 1)

The serophage learns early in life that they can exercise some control over their own blood, and they harness that ability to Awaken the magic that flows through their veins. The dark possibilities of this form of magic become apparent when a Sorcerer discovers that they can control the blood flowing in the veins of other creatures, too. Thus is born the serophage, a Sorcerer unlike all others.

### Strength Beneath the Skin (Level 1)

At 1st level, someone who chooses this Origin gains control over his or her blood flow, directing it away from a recent wound. When the serophage takes bludgeoning damage, he or she rolls a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and subtracts the result from the damage taken. When he or she reaches 6th level, the die increases to a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`).

### Blood Fuel (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, instead of taking a move action, a serophage can deal `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) slashing damage to him- or herself and regain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slashing damage. Alternatively, the serophage can choose to increase the save DC or the attack bonus of the next spell he or she casts by +1 instead of regaining Sorcery Points. When the serophage reaches 12th level, the die becomes a d8 and the increase to his or her attack bonus or save DC becomes +2.

### Blood Barrier (Level 14)

At 14th level, a serophage gains the ability to draw blood from a creature with Intelligence 5 or higher that has been killed within the last 30 minutes and form it into swirling rings that surround the Sorcerer. The number of rings is equal to his or her Charisma modifier.

The rings absorb physical damage. When the serophage is struck by a melee or ranged weapon attack, one ring absorbs `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) damage from the attack, and then disappears in a splash.

As an action, the serophage can cause one ring to form into a magical spear of blood and launch itself at a target he or she selects within 60 feet. The Sorcerer makes a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes piercing damage equal to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) + the serophage's Charisma modifier and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the start of the serophage's next turn. The spear is considered a magic weapon. It evaporates after it's expended. Each ring remains until it either absorbs damage or is expended as a weapon.

### Siphon Blood (Level 18)

At 18th level, a serophage gains the ability to siphon a steady stream of blood from a living creature at a distance. As an action, he or she designates a creature within 40 feet; that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage as blood oozes through its skin and flows through the air to the serophage, who absorbs it through their own skin. For every 2 points of damage dealt to the target, the serophage chooses to regain either 1 hit point or 1 sorcery point. The siphoning continues, dealing damage and restoring hit points or Sorcery Points at the start of the serophage's turn, until he or she ends the effect (no action required), or until the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn.
