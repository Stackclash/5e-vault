## Class Features

### Prescient Knight (Level 3)

The prescient knight is the culmination of long years of study, practice, and dedication to the craft of combat divination by those seeking the ultimate martial expression of that art. Their ability to meld martial prowess with combat divination makes them a formidable force on the field of battle.

### Spellcasting (Level 3)

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See "chapter 10" for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

#### Cantrips

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

#### Spell Slots
_Source: Deep Magic_

The Prescient Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md) and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md) using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
_Source: Deep Magic_

The Prescient Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spells are known at 1st level and higher. When choosing this martial tradition, you learn three 1st-level spells.

You are limited in your selection to wizard spells of the divination and abjuration schools.

Additionally, you can choose any divination spell with a casting time of 1 reaction or 1 bonus action, whether or not it's on the wizard spell list.

You learn additional spells as you progress; newly learned spells have the same school and list restrictions as your original spells.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace one spell you know with another from among those spells you can know.

#### Spellcasting Ability
_Source: Deep Magic_

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<span class='abilityDc'>**Spell save DC**: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</span>

<span class='abilityAttackMod'>**Spell attack modifier**: your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</span>

### Reactive Echo (Level 3)

When choosing this archetype, your ability to anticipate the actions of your foes allows you to take a second reaction during a round in which you use your [Action Surge](compendium/classes/fighter.md#Action%20Surge%20(Level%202)).

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 3)

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in [Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)

### Martial Caster (Level 3)

At 3rd level you can cast spells having a somatic component while you are wielding a weapon and/or shield, provided you are proficient with those items.

### Constant Vigilance (Level 7)

Beginning at 7th level, you have a preternatural awareness of your surroundings in times of duress.

If you are surprised but not [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) at the start of combat, you can use your [Action Surge](compendium/classes/fighter.md#Action%20Surge%20(Level%202)) to negate surprise for yourself and take a normal turn plus one additional action (for the [Action Surge](compendium/classes/fighter.md#Action%20Surge%20(Level%202))) in the first round of combat.

Additionally, using your [Action Surge](compendium/classes/fighter.md#Action%20Surge%20(Level%202)) this way allows you to give sufficient warning to your allies who are within 15 feet of you so they can also start taking reactions after your turn.

### Evasion (Level 10)

At 10th level, your foreknowledge of events to come allows you to position yourself in the most advantageous manner. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and half damage if you fail.

### Anticipatory Strike (Level 15)

At 15th level, your connection to threads of fate strengthens, providing greater insight into the movements and actions of your opponents. When you use an [Action Surge](compendium/classes/fighter.md#Action%20Surge%20(Level%202)), you have advantage on attack rolls and a +2 bonus to your AC until the end of your next turn.

### Action Free of Thought (Level 18)

At 18th level, your martial mastery of combat divination is such that you are able to react to your opponent without conscious thought and with minimal physical effort. During combat, you can take one reaction every turn instead of one per round.
