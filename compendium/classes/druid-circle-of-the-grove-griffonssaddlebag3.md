## Class Features

### Circle of the Grove (Level 2)

Druids of the Circle of the Grove spend weeks alone in forest glades in silent meditation. They find peace and wisdom in the stillness of the woods, and in time learn how to become a part of them themselves. Ancient rings of trees are sometimes archdruids themselves, transformed into trees in endless meditation. Dryads and half-dryads that become practicing druids are often members of this Circle.

### Circle Spells (Level 2)

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, your deep-rooted connection to plantlife grants you the ability to cast certain spells. This connection grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of the Grove Spells table.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that does not appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

**Circle of the Grove Spells**

| Druid Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| 2nd | [goodberry](compendium/spells/goodberry.md), [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md) |
| 3rd | [enlarge/reduce](compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md), [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) |
| 5th | [plant growth](compendium/spells/plant-growth.md), [speak with animals](compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md) |

### Plant Shape (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape to transform into an awakened shrub. You decide the kind of shrub, as well as the nature of its trimming. Furthermore, when you assume the form of a beast using Wild Shape, you can cause the form to have the plant type instead. When you do, the bestial form becomes made of foliage, vines, and similar plant matter. The plant version of the bestial form has vulnerability to fire damage.

While transformed into a plant, your melee attacks can use your Wisdom modifier for attack and damage rolls, instead of Strength or Dexterity.

You can cast any spell that you know from your Circle of the Grove Spells table while transformed into a plant in this way. Starting at 5th level, when you use an action to cast the [plant growth](compendium/spells/plant-growth.md) spell while transformed into a plant, you also regain a number of hit points equal to 3d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

### Razor Leaf (Level 2)

Also at 2nd level, you can use an action to hurl up to 2 magical leaves at a target that you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each leaf, which can target either the same target or a different one. On a hit, a target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier.

The leaves damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

You can use this feature even while transformed into a plant using your Wild Shape. Once per turn, if you miss with one of the leaves and are transformed into a plant, you can immediately make one extra attack with another leaf against that target. In addition, when you use your Wild Shape to transform into a plant, you can immediately make an attack with one of these leaves as part of that transformation.

### Rooted (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you take on treelike features while concentrating on a druid spell. Choose a Rooted Appearance or roll on the table below.

`dice: [](druid-circle-of-the-grove-griffonssaddlebag3.md#^1-appearance)`

| dice: 1d6 | Appearance |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Your hair turns green and leafy or grasslike. |
| 2 | Your eyes resemble tree knots. |
| 3 | Your fingers look like twigs. |
| 4 | You bleed sap. |
| 5 | Flowers sprout from your body. |
| 6 | When you move, it sounds like a creaking tree. |
^1-appearance

For as long as you have this appearance, you gain a +10 bonus to any Dexterity (Stealth) check you make in areas of dense foliage. Starting at 10th level, you also can not be moved against your will or knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) while you have it.

In addition, if the spell was cast using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, your skin becomes barklike. You gain the effect of the [barkskin](compendium/spells/barkskin.md) spell for as long as you concentrate on the spell. For the duration, you have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning and piercing damage, and if you are also transformed into a plant creature, you ignore any vulnerability to fire damage you have.

### Greater Plant Shape (Level 10)

At 10th level, your understanding of plant forms becomes second nature to you. You can use a bonus action to transform into either an awakened shrub or plant version of a beast using your Wild Shape, instead of using an action. Further, your plant forms no longer have vulnerability to fire damage.

You can also use an action to use your Wild Shape to transform into an awakened tree. The height of this tree can be a number of feet tall up to twice your druid level. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a shambling mound. When an engulfed creature escapes the mounds grapple, that creature is no longer engulfed and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the mound.

### Oakheart (Level 14)

By 14th level, you are as strong and timeless as even the most ancient oaks.

- If you spend at least 1 hour in sunlight, you do not need to eat or drink for 24 hours.  
- You always have the [transport via plants](compendium/spells/transport-via-plants.md) spell prepared, which does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. Further, you can cast it once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast it in this way, you can not do so again until you finish a long rest.  
- Roots extend from you while you are transformed into a plant using Wild Shape, provided that you are on the ground. Hostile creatures within 30 feet of you treat the ground as if its difficult terrain, as your roots reach up and hinder their movement. You also have tremorsense out to the same range.
