## Class Features

### Misdirector (Level 3)

While many rogues are adept with sleight of hand, you don't stop there. You have developed a natural knack for deception using magic and curious projections of yourself to misdirect and confound those around you. Most rogues who follow this archetype are street magicians, burglars, or theatrical performers, but could just as well be particularly larcenous worshipers of a god of trickery.

### Conjure Projection (Level 3)

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to project a perfect, illusory duplicate of yourself. As a bonus action, you can create this duplicate in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. Its AC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier, and it gains a bonus to any saving throw it makes equal to your Charisma modifier. When you gain the Evasion feature at 7th level, your duplicate gains the benefits of that feature as well.

You can move your duplicate up to 30 feet on each of your turns (no action required). If you take the Dash or Disengage action, your duplicate gains the benefit of that action as well. Your duplicate remains for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it or use this feature again, or until it takes any damage. It vanishes early if you end your turn more than 60 feet away from it or are [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) at the start of your turn. Any effect that can deal damage to a creature can also affect a duplicate. A duplicate can't be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and is immune to poison and psychic damage.

If your duplicate is within 5 feet of a creature, you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against that creature. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

Your duplicate appears to carry the same equipment as you, although it doesn't gain the benefits of any magic items or armor you're wearing or carrying. You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to command your duplicate to make a weapon attack against a target that you can see within the weapon's range, using your ability modifier and proficiency bonus for the attack roll. If it's a ranged attack, the illusory weapon creates its own ammunition or, if it's thrown, it returns to the duplicate at the end of the turn. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to your rogue level. This attack can't benefit from your Sneak Attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you finish a short rest and have no uses of this feature remaining, you regain one use.

### Bonus Spells (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip. When you reach 9th level, you can cast the [major image](compendium/spells/major-image.md) or [mirror image](compendium/spells/mirror-image.md) spell; once you cast one of these spells, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Improved Conjure Projection (Level 9)

Starting at 9th level, you can use your Conjure Projection feature to create up to two duplicates, instead of one, whenever you expend a use of that feature. You can move each of your duplicates independently, but you can only command one to make an attack as a bonus action on each of your turns. While you're within 5 feet of a duplicate, attacks against you and the duplicate are made with disadvantage.

You can also use an action to see and hear through a duplicate until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, but can also speak through your duplicate using your own voice.

### Illusionist (Level 13)

By 13th level, you know how to recognize and manipulate illusions to their fullest. Choose one of the following options.

#### Discerning Trickster

You gain a +5 bonus to Intelligence (Investigation) checks and your passive Wisdom (Perception) score when determining or detecting illusions, respectively. You can cast minor illusion using a bonus action, and your spell save DC when casting minor illusion or major image increases by 2. In addition, your duplicates' AC increases by 2.

#### Vigilant Duplicates

A duplicate can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against a creature that either moves out of its reach or makes an attack against a target other than the duplicate while within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to your rogue level. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack, rolling half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level when it does (rounded up).

### Mirror Position (Level 17)

By 17th level, you and your projected duplicates are practically interchangeable. When you're hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to switch places with a duplicate that you can see. The duplicate then takes the damage from the attack instead, destroying it and causing it to shatter into magical shrapnel. If the attacker is within 5 feet of the shattered duplicate, it also takes force damage equal to your rogue level. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
