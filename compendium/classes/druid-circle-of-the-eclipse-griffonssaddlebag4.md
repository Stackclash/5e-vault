## Class Features

### Circle of the Eclipse (Level 2)

Druids of the Circle of the Eclipse are stewards of the celestial balance, and draw their power from the luminous bond shared by sun and moon. They find their strength waxing and waning with the ebb and flow of these celestial bodies, but it is during the rare moments of eclipse, when the world is briefly cloaked in celestial union, that they feel truly connected to the natural world and the cosmos above. Masters of both the brilliance of daylight and the mystique of darkness, druids of this circle embody the harmony of cosmic forces, wielding their celestial magic to protect the natural world and preserve the delicate equilibrium of day and night.

### Circle Spells (Level 2)

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, your deep-rooted connection to plantlife grants you the ability to cast certain spells. This connection grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of the Eclipse Spells table.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that does not appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

**Circle of the Eclipse Spells**

| Druid Level | Light Form Spells | Dark Form Spells |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 2nd | [bless](compendium/spells/bless.md) | [bane](compendium/spells/bane.md) |
| 3rd | [flaming sphere](compendium/spells/flaming-sphere.md) | [darkness](compendium/spells/darkness.md) |
| 5th | [mass healing word](compendium/spells/mass-healing-word.md) | [hypnotic pattern](compendium/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md) |

### Light and Dark Forms (Level 2)

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, your relationship to both sun and moon grants you power over light and darkness. You have two forms at 2nd level: light and dark. You can use a bonus action to change into light form or dark form. You can return to your normal form at any time (no action required). Each form grants you a series of different effects, as described below, which persist even while you are transformed into a beast by Wild Shape.

Your appearance changes when in these forms. You can choose how you appear in either form or use the table below to determine your appearance.

`dice: [](druid-circle-of-the-eclipse-griffonssaddlebag4.md#^light-form-apperance-dark-form-appearance)`

| dice: d6 | Light Form Apperance | Dark Form Appearance |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Your eyes glow white. | Your eyes become wells of darkness. |
| 2 | You emit a warm, soft glow, as if you were perpetually well lit. | You emit a faint aura of darkness, making your body appear darker than it should |
| 3 | Your hair turns white and golden. | Your hair turns inky black, like a crow's feather. |
| 4 | Golden, druidic tattoos appear across your body. | Your veins look dark and inky from beneath your skin. |
| 5 | Flowers turn to face you and stretch wide in your presence. | Flowers close when you're near them, as if it were night. |
| 6 | Flecks of golden pollen float around you, and the air feels several degrees warmer. | Moonlit specks of dust swirl around you, and the air feels several degrees cooler. |

### Eclipse Dice (Level 2)

Also at 2nd level, the power of the sun and moon that flows through you manifests as a pool of energy, which is represented by a number of d8s equal to your druid level. Collectively, these dice are called your eclipse dice, although their specific names and effects are determined by your current form.

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you and spend any number of these dice up to your proficiency bonus. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The effect of the dice depends on which form you're in.

- **Sun Dice (Light Form).** The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the total of the roll, plus the number of dice spent. If there are one or more other creatures within 5 feet of the target, you can instead divide the number of temporary hit points between them, up to the available total.  
- **Moon Dice (Dark Form).** The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your druid spell save DC or take psychic damage equal to the total of the roll.  

You regain all of your expended eclipse dice when you finish a long rest.

### Eclipse Form (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, you can bring your light and dark forms together into a special third form, called your eclipse form. To do so, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to transform into your eclipse form, instead of transforming into a beast. You can remain in this form for up to 1 minute; for the duration, your physical body becomes shrouded in total darkness, like a living silhouette, and you emit a fiery glow. While in your eclipse form, you gain the following benefits:

- Your Sun and Moon Dice become d12s, instead of d8s.  
- You can use either Sun or Moon Dice on your turns, which you can do as part of the bonus action to transform into this form.  
- You can cast spells from either form's spell list on your turns.  

### Sight of Lightless Moon (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet, even if you're transformed by Wild Shape.

In addition, you can use an action to magically detect the presence of any illusions or shapechangers within 30 feet of you. You know the number and type of any illusion or shapeshifter whose presence you sense, but not its identity, original form, or exact location. You can do this a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Radiance of the Blinding Sun (Level 14)

By the time you reach 14th level, you embody the essence of the sun and moon. Whenever you roll one or more eclipse dice, you add your Wisdom modifier to the total of the roll.

In addition, you emit an aura while in light, dark, or eclipse form. The aura extends from you in a 10-foot radius. Friendly creatures within the aura can perceive within its area as if they had blindsight, out to the aura's range. The area's appearance also changes depending on your current form, as do its additional properties.

- **Sun Aura (Light Form).** The area within your aura is filled with bright light. You and friendly creatures within the aura have resistance to fire damage.  
- **Moon Aura (Dark Form).** The area within your aura is filled with cool, dim light. You and friendly creatures within the aura have resistance to cold damage.  
- **Umbral Aura (Eclipse Form).** The area within your aura is filled with darkness. You and friendly creatures within the aura have resistance to fire and cold damage. A hostile creature that enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier and must make a Constitution saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. Hostile creatures with the Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity trait treat the area as if it were sunlight for the purposes of those traits.  

You can suppress your aura at any time (no action required) or use a bonus action to start emitting it again, which can be done as part of the bonus action to use your eclipse dice.
