## Class Features

### Wealth Domain (Level 1)

The Wealth domain is a divine path followed by those who worship gods of riches, trade, and prosperity. Through their prayer and devotion to these deities (such as Lugh, Hermes, or Ptha), clerics of this domain are granted the power to manipulate wealth, fortune, and commerce to aid their allies and lead the way to success. These clerics are often found in bustling cities and markets, using their abilities to protect their congregations financial interests and to bring prosperity to their communities. Those who walk the path of the Wealth Domain are trusted and respected by merchants and financiers, and their blessings can mean the difference between success and ruin for those under their care. To them, they know first hand that money does not grow on trees: it comes directly from the gods.

### Dimensional Treasury (Level 1)

At 1st level, you gain the ability to store coins and gemstones in a special extradimensional space. You can use an action to store any number of coins or gemstones that you are holding in this space; retrieving items stored in the space, up to an amount that you can carry, requires a bonus action. If you need a specific value of coins, you magically retrieve the exact amount. You always know the total value of any currency stored in the space. Furthermore, while holding a nonmagical item, you can study it over the course of 1 minute to magically learn its monetary value.

In addition, you gain proficiency in either the Deception or Persuasion skill (your choice). Whenever you make a Charisma check with regards to money, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Charisma, for the roll.

### Hand of Midas (Level 1)

Also at 1st level, you can use an action to make a special melee spell attack against a target within your reach, using your cleric spell attack bonus. When you do, your hand shimmers with a golden glow, and on a hit, the target takes 1d12 radiant damage.

This features damage increases by 1d12 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

If you roll a 12 on one or more of the damage dice, the target suffers an effect based on the number of 12s you rolled, as detailed below. For every 12 you roll on the damage dice, more and more of the target is magically turned to gold for the duration of the effect.

#### One

The targets speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

#### Two

The target is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the start of your next turn.

#### Three or more

The target is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the start of your next turn, at which point it makes a Constitution saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is [petrified](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw against this effect at the end of each of its turns for the duration. On a success, the effect ends. Even if the target succeeds on the saving throw against the initial effect, its still [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the start of your next turn.

### Channel Divinity: Golden Cauldron (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to call for immediate commerce.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and conjure a Medium gilded cauldron on the ground in an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of you. The cauldron is a sphere that is roughly 5 feet in diameter with a 3-foot-diameter mouth. Any nonmagical object that is not being worn or carried that you place entirely within the cauldron immediately vanishes and turns into a number of coins: the exact amount that it would sell for at a general merchant, or half the amount that it could typically be bought for.

While there are coins in the cauldron, you can use an action to speak the name of any piece of mundane, nonmagical adventuring gear or equipment, including weapons, armor, tools, and trade goods (but not living creatures). If there is enough money in the cauldron, the appropriate number of coins vanish and are replaced by the item. For a list of available items and their respective costs, refer to Chapter 5: Equipment in the Basic Rules.

Once the cauldron has created an amount of gold up to 5 times your cleric level, it can not create any more coins until you use this Channel Divinity again.

At the GMs discretion, your deity may refuse to offer you any compensation for items placed in the cauldron. When this happens, the item magically appears on the ground in the nearest unoccupied space outside of the cauldron.

The cauldron remains for 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required). It vanishes early if its ever more than 100 feet away from you or if its reduced to 0 hit points; its AC is equal to your cleric spell save DC, and it has a number of hit points equal to 5 times your cleric level. The cauldron itself weighs 25 pounds.

For the duration, you can command the cauldron to move up to 30 feet using an action. When you do, the cauldron sprouts a pair of short arms and legs. At the end of this movement, you can then choose to deliver your Hand of Midas attack as if you were in its space; the cauldron then reaches out to touch the target. You must use your own senses when using this feature. At the end of the action, the cauldrons form returns to normal.

### Wealth Points (Level 6)

At 6th level, you gain a new way to barter with your deity, called wealth points. You have a number of wealth points equal to half your cleric level, rounded up, and you regain any spent points whenever you finish a long rest.

You can spend wealth points in the following ways:

#### Influence

You can spend 1 wealth point to reroll a Charisma check that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll.

#### Power

You can use an action to spend 2 or more wealth points to regain an expended spell slot. The spell slot level depends on the number of wealth points spent: 1st level (2 points), 2nd level (3 points), 3rd level (5 points), 4th level (6 points), or 5th level (7 points).

Alternatively, you can spend 1 or more wealth points to automatically turn a number of damage dice from your Hand of Midas feature into a 12: one die (1 point), two dice (3 points), or three dice (5 points).

#### Safety

When you make a saving throw, you can spend a number of wealth points up to your Wisdom modifier to gain a +1 bonus to the roll for each point spent. You spend these points after making the saving throw, but before you know the results.

#### Riches

You can use an action to spend 1 or more wealth points to purchase one item, as if by your Golden Cauldron Channel Divinity; 1 wealth point is equal to 500 gp. Any item purchased with wealth points in this way appears in your open hand or at your feet (your choice). It is golden, obviously magical, and disappears after 1 hour. An item immediately corrodes and turns to dust if you attempt to use it as a material component for a spell or if you attempt to sell or otherwise trade it.

Alternatively, you can spend 3 wealth points to create a special gilded chest in the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The chest is 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. It is magically weightless and can be used in place of the normal material components for the [secret chest](compendium/spells/leomunds-secret-chest.md) spell. When you cast the spell using this special chest, it does not require you to have a Tiny replica of it. Instead, to recall the chest or send it back to the Ethereal Plane after casting the spell, you must use an action to spend 1 wealth point, in place of using the replica. The gilded chest disappears from the Material Plane if you are ever more than 30 feet away from it, ending the spell early and dropping its contents on the ground.

### Potent Spellcasting (Level 8)

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip and your Hand of Midas feature.

### Divine Coffers (Level 17)

By 17th level, your piety has earned you access to limitless wealth when used for divine purposes. When you cast a cleric spell that has a material component with a listed cost of no more than 1,000 gp, you can ignore the material component of that spell. Once you ignore a spells material component in this way, you can not do so again when casting that spell until you finish a long rest.

In addition, your Golden Cauldron can remain indefinitely once you summon it, although its other restrictions still apply. When you command the cauldron to move, it can magically fly up to 30 feet, and at the end of its movement, you can choose to cast a spell as though you were in its space (instead of delivering your Hand of Midas attack). You must use your own senses, and the spell must have a casting time of 1 action.
