## Class Features

### Void Caster (Level 2)

Given the Nature of Void Magic, it comes as no Surprise that a specialty of arcane spellcasting sprang up from the study of Void Speech.

### Wizard Specialty (Level 2)

Void casters are a standoffish and secretive lot, prone to delving into monster-prowled ruins and the dark corners of moldering libraries with equal caution; carelessly reading a text that might be sprinkled with Void glyphs can be just as deadly as stumbling into a den of trolls. As Void casters continue to study Void Speech, they learn to properly invoke the words and glyphs to empower a special type of magic that taps the vast potential of the Void.

Some Void casters risk the darkness for the sake of gaining knowledge or strengthening one's defenses against that which lies beyond. Others succumb to the madness and corruption that Void magic causes and become living conduits for the horrors seeking entry into the world.

### Void Affinity (Level 2)

A Void caster can accumulate twice the normal amount of Void Taint before being affected by exposure to the Voidâ€”and has advantage on saving throws made to resist gaining Void Taint.

### Whispers of the Void (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action immediately before [casting a spell](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Cast%20a%20Spell) of 1st level or higher, a Void caster can utter a few words of Void Speech and weave its Dark Magic into the spell. The tainted spell disorients one creature the caster can see that the spell affects when it is cast. The creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the start of the Void caster's next turn. The caster must be able to speak in order to use this feature.

### Rebuke from Beyond (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, when damaged by a creature within 60 feet, a Void caster can use a reaction to bark a destructive word of Void Speech. If the creature can hear the caster, it takes necrotic damage equal to half the caster's wizard level + his or her Intelligence modifier. A caster can use this ability a number of times equal to his or her Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), and regains all expended uses after finishing a long rest. The caster can't use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.

### Powerful Echo (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, when casting a Void magic spell that targets only one creature, a Void caster can also target a second creature. Additionally, he or she has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on Void spells.

### Manifestation (Level 14)

At 14th level, a Void caster can choose a point he or she can see within 60 feet and use an action to utter a complicated phrase in Void Speech. The area within 20 feet of the point is shrouded in dim light for 1 minute. Any creature in the area that is hostile to the caster gains vulnerability to necrotic damage and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks. An affected creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) necrotic damage, or half that damage with a successful Constitution saving throw (using the Void caster's spell save DC). Once a caster uses this ability, it can't be used again until after finishing a short or long rest. The caster can't use this feature if he or she is unable to speak.
