### Moon's Grace (Level 1)

When you select this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills, and you don't have disadvantage on [Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth) checks from wearing medium armor.

### Channel Divinity: Night's Chill (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness moonlight to banish magical light and deal cold damage to your foes. By presenting your holy symbol as an action, any magical light within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes (2d10 + your cleric level) cold damage, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

### Luminescent Aura (Level 6)

At 6th level, you can use an action to emit a nimbus of light in a 30-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. This acts as a [light](compendium/spells/light.md) spell but provides only dim illumination. All weapons and ammunition are treated as silvered while they're in the aura and for one round after leaving it. Opponents that end their turn in the aura must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be limned in silver light, identical in effect to a [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md) spell, until the end of their next turn.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).

### The Moonlit Way (Level 17)

Beginning at 17th level, anytime the moon is visible in the sky, you can use an action to detect magical pathways and portals such as fey roads, shadow roads, gate effects, and the like. The portal must be within your line of sight and no farther away from you than 120 feet. You must complete a short or long rest before using this ability again.

Detected portals are visible to you, but you can point out their locations to others. By spending a minute concentrating on a portal detected with this ability, you can sense the physical conditions around its destination.
