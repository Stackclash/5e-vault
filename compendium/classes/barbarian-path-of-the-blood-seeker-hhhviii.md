## Class Features

### Path of the Blood Seeker (Level 3)

While any barbarian is a fearsome sight on the battlefield, few manage to inspire as much terror as those that follow the Path of the Blood Seeker. Mindless engines of destruction, these barbarians revel in the spilling of blood, uncaring whether it is an enemy's or their own.

Many believe that the blood seekers may have been one of the first barbarian paths bestowed upon the sentient races; their thirst for violence tapping into a primal hunting urge from our earliest roots. Barbarians that fuel their rage with blood lust become relentless, animalistic warriors in the way they tear their foes to shreds and then bask in the carnage they have created. Some even go so far as slicing their own flesh to quench their thirst; it is not uncommon to find them covered in intricate scar patterns of their own making or covered in paint made from their own blood.

### Blood Rage (Level 3)

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you are able to enter a blood rage, becoming stronger as your foes grow weaker. While raging, your Rage Damage bonus is doubled when you hit a creature that has less than half its maximum hit points.

### Bloodletter (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, your experience in bloodletting allows you to draw more blood from the creatures you kill. Whenever you successfully harvest a creature's blood, the amount that you receive is doubled.

### Crimson Spray (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, the sheer ferocity you display in battle imbues your own blood with the power to revitalise your allies. While raging, whenever you take slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage, all allies within 5 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). This range increases to 10 feet when you reach 14th level in this class.

### Hunter of the Weakened (Level 10)

At 10th level, your senses become attuned to finding dying creatures. You may use your bonus action to become instantly aware of the distance and direction of all creatures within 60 feet of you that currently have less than half their maximum hit points.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after finishing a long rest.

### Blood Frenzy (Level 14)

When you reach 14th level, your lust for blood becomes so visceral that even the slightest hint of it is able to spur you into frenzied action. While raging, you may use your bonus action to move up to your speed in a straight line towards a creature that does not have all of their hit points. If you make a melee weapon attack against that creature directly after that movement, that attack has advantage.
