## Class Features

### Angler (Level 3)

Anglers are rangers that revel in maritime battles of attrition and grit. While anyone can be a fisher, an Angler uses the lessons they have learned on the water as a basis for how they hunt across the multiverse.

### Angler Magic (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Angler Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it does not count against the number of ranger spells you know.

**Angler Spells**

| Ranger Level | Spells |
|--------------|--------|
| 3rd | [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md) (looks like a large fishing net) |
| 5th | [rope trick](compendium/spells/rope-trick.md) |
| 9th | [water walk](compendium/spells/water-walk.md) |
| 13th | [evard's black tentacles](compendium/spells/evards-black-tentacles.md) |
| 17th | [hold monster](compendium/spells/hold-monster.md) |
^angler-spells

### Angler Weapons (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, using a net at long range does not impose disadvantage on the attack roll with it. Furthermore, you can magically repair a destroyed net you are holding using an action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, attacking with the net does not prevent you from making a second attack as part of the Attack action.

In addition, javelins, spears, and tridents are considered to be finesse weapons for you.

### Reel In (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature takes an extra 1d4 force damage from the attack as its pierced by a spectral hook, which remains until the end of your turn. A creature is hooked while the hook remains.

You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to pull any hooked creature thats Large or smaller up to 5 feet toward you, or 10 feet if its underwater. If you hit a creature with a thrown weapon on your turn, that weapon is magically pulled back to your open hand or dropped at your feet (your choice) as part of this bonus action. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to magically pull any weapon you have thrown on your turn back to your open hand, provided that you can see the weapon within 60 feet of you. You choose which affected creatures or weapons are pulled each time you use this feature.

### Sea Legs (Level 7)

By 7th level, you are at home on the water and can resist the push and pull of its tides. You gain a swimming speed equal to 10 + your walking speed, and can hold your breath for up to 10 minutes. If you are moved against your will, the distance you are moved is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 0 feet). You also have advantage on saving throws against being knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone), and if you are more than 5 feet away from a target thats [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone), your attack rolls against it are not made with disadvantage as a result of that condition.

### Barbed (Level 11)

Starting at 11th level, the force damage from Reel In increases to 1d6. Further, when you use the bonus action from that feature, any creature affected by it, even if it is not moved, can not make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of the turn.

In addition, nets you throw have an escape DC equal to your ranger spell save DC. Whenever a creature fails to escape from a net that you threw or an [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md) spell that you cast, that creature immediately takes 1d6 piercing damage and is moved horizontally up to 5 feet in a direction of your choice. Moving a creature in this way also moves the net its [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by, and if a creature is moved outside the area of an [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md) spell you cast in this way, it is no longer affected by the spell.

### Master Angler (Level 15)

By 15th level, your skill as an angler is unmatched. You can now move a creature of any size using the bonus action from Reel In. Further, the maximum distance you can move a creature with it is doubled, and you can choose to push, rather than pull, any creature affected by it, as if by a crashing wave. When you push a Medium or smaller creature in this way, it must also make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC (its choice). On a failure, the creature is knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
