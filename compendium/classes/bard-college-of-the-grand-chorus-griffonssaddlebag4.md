## Class Features

### College of the Grand Chorus (Level 3)

Bards that have honed their craft in the College of the Grand Chorus sing magical, uplifting arias that reverberate and strengthen those around them. Those that participate in these choruses are united against harm through their shared efforts. Together, these choruses create harmonies of protection in moments of need, which echo through the ages as folk song and legend.

### Bonus Languages (Level 3)

When you join the College of the Grand Chorus at 3rd level, you learn three languages of your choice.

### Bardic Aura (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you can create a bolstering current of magical song, which echoes around you while you maintain it. You can use an action to begin this aria, and you can continue it on each of your subsequent turns using a bonus action, provided that you're able to speak. The aria lasts for up to 1 minute; it ends early if you're incapacitated or if the aria isn't continued.

On your turn, your aria is continued automatically if you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration (such as by giving a Bardic Inspiration die to another creature), or if you cast a bard spell that has only a verbal component. Furthermore, if such a spell has a casting time of 1 action, it can be cast using a bonus action for the duration of your aria; you can't cast the same spell twice on a turn.

Each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can hear the aria, including yourself, gains a +1 bonus to saving throws. This bonus increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 10th level (+2) and 15th level (+3).

You can use this feature 4 times. You regain all expended uses whenever you finish a long rest.

### Practiced Vocalist (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, you can always entertain or lead a crowd with a song. When you make a Charisma (Performance) check to sing, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Inspired Audience (Level 6)

By 6th level, other creatures can draw inspiration from your aria. When a friendly creature within the aria's range that can hear it makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, it can use its reaction to call upon your bardic magic, provided that you're willing. When it does so, you automatically expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration and the creature immediately rolls one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, adding it to the total of the triggering roll. The creature makes this choice after rolling the d20, but before knowing whether it succeeds or fails.

In addition, your aria is also continued whenever you use your Countercharm feature.

### Grand Chorus (Level 14)

At 14th level, the strength of your aria has increased, granting you the following benefits while you maintain it:

- Your speed increases by 10 feet.  
- Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.  

Furthermore, your aria can drive others to join in as its chorus. Any friendly creature within the aria's range can use a bonus action on its turn to participate in the song. To participate, a creature must be able to hear the aria and speak at least one language. A participating creature also gains the above benefits until the start of its next turn.

Lastly, whenever a friendly creature rolls one of your Bardic Inspiration dice within the range of your aria, both you and that creature each gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the die. You must be able to see or hear each other, and the creature must be able to hear the aria.
