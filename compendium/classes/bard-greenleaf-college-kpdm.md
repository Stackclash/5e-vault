## Class Features

### Greenleaf College (Level 3)

The Greenleaf College was founded by half-elves who sought to celebrate their varied heritage. Drawing from elven lore for inspiration and power, Greenleaf bards strengthen their connection to nature. Through their magic and their tales, they convey the rejuvenating strength of the forests and rivers to their allies.

### Expanded Spell List (Level 3)

When you join the Greenleaf College at 3rd level, you gain access to an expanded list of bard spells. The following spells are added to the bard spell list for you.

**Greenleaf College Spells**

| Bard Level | Spells |
|------------|--------|
| 1st | [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md), [goodberry](compendium/spells/goodberry.md) |
| 2nd | [pass without trace](compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md), [spike growth](compendium/spells/spike-growth.md) |
| 3rd | [conjure animals](compendium/spells/conjure-animals.md), [daylight](compendium/spells/daylight.md) |
| 4th | [conjure woodland beings](compendium/spells/conjure-woodland-beings.md), [dominate beast](compendium/spells/dominate-beast.md) |

### Rejuvenating Inspiration (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, you learn to infuse your [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) with a magical seed of healing energy. When a creature uses a [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) die from you to increase one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, it also gains temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) die plus your Charisma modifier.

### Land's Stride (Level 6)

At 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the entangle spell.

### Vital Surge (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, as an action you can expend one use of [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) to magically remove one disease or detrimental condition affecting a creature you can see within 60 feet.

The condition can be [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned).
