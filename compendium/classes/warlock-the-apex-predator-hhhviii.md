## Class Features

### The Apex Predator (Level 1)

Your patron is one of the most powerful predators in the multiverse such as a [tarrasque](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md), an astral dreadnought, or an ancient dragon. More than simple beasts, these creatures dominate their domains, taking whatever they want from whoever gets in their way. While these creatures normally treat all other creatures as simply potential meals, they still appreciate the utility that vassals can provide for them. As part of your pact, you take whatever scraps of power and resources they leave behind while serving them by finding new prey or intercepting any threat that would try to usurp their top position.

### Expanded Spell List (Level 1)

The Apex Predator lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### Establish Dominance (Level 1)

At 1st level you learn to channel your patron's presence in order to mentally dominate your prey. As an action, you can force a target you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If a creature has a challenge rating lower than your warlock level, they make the saving throw at disadvantage. On a failure, your target is [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for the next minute. While [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you in this way, a creature also has disadvantage on saving throws imposed by you and cannot benefit from spells that grant it a bonus to their movement speed. In addition, you have advantage on [opportunity attacks](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) made against the [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature. A [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature may attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Devour Prey (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, your patron grants you access to a pocket dimension where your prey is devoured alive. As an action, you may target a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, forcing them to make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, that creature is banished to a pocket dimension. While there, the target is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), and at the end of each of its turns, it may make another Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it suffers acid damage equal to your warlock level plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). On a success, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the creature dies while in your pocket dimension, you may choose to have all of their harvestable materials reappear in the creature's original space instead of their corpse. These harvestable materials are in perfect condition and can be collected without issue.

Once you use this feature once, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Hunter Becomes the Hunted (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, you learn to retaliate against any creature that would attempt to harm you. Whenever a creature damages you, you gain advantage on all weapon and spell attack rolls against that creature until the end of your next turn.

### Top of the Food Chain (Level 14)

At 14th level, your dominance over lesser creatures gives you a protection against their mediocre abilities. Creatures that have a challenge rating lower than half your warlock level rounded down have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on saving throws imposed by them or their abilities.
