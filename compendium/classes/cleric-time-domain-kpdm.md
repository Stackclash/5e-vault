## Class Features

### Time Domain (Level 1)

Most spellcasters and sages agree that significant alterations to time are undesirable, but they disagree strongly on what constitutes a significant alteration. As might be expected, those of Good alignment typically try to protect time from those who seek to make significant changes or bend time to their will, while those of Evil alignment try to change what's passed for their own selfish purposes.

### Prescient Glimpses (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Insight and Perception, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.

### Channel Divinity: Time Shift (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to shift time and alter the order of initiative. As an action, you can move yourself in the initiative order to any point of your choosing

### Channel Divinity: Group Time Shift (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to shift time for others as well as yourself. Choose up to three allies. When you use your Channel Divinity, you can also move them in the initiative order to any positions of your choosing. An allied creature can choose not to be affected

### Prescient Strike (Level 8)

Beginning at 8th level, you intuitively know where your enemies will be in the immediate future and how they will attack. You gain advantage on one attack roll each turn when you take the Attack action. Alternatively, you can take a reaction when a creature attacks you to give that creature disadvantage on its attack roll against you.

### Master of Time (Level 17)

At 17th level, you add [foresight](compendium/spells/foresight.md) and [time stop](compendium/spells/time-stop.md) to your spell list. You are never surprised, and whenever you and your allies might be surprised, you can grant up to six allies the ability to make Wisdom saving throws to avoid being surprised, as if they had your Prescient Glimpses feature.
