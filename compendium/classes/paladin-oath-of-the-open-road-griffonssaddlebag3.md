## Class Features

### Oath of the Open Road (Level 3)

Paladins who swear the Oath of the Open Road are bound to protect the spirit, safety, and sanctity of exploration. These nomadic defenders see themselves as guardians of the roads less traveled, protecting those who journey them and ensuring the safety of travelers in a world that brims with adventure. Theirs is a calling rooted in the ethos of freedom, embracing the journey itself as a pilgrimage toward self-discovery and enlightenment.

### Tenets of the Open Road (Level 3)

The tenets of the Oath of the Open Road are carried as a guide to safe and fruitful travel.

- **A Good Gift Is One Shared.** Your protection of others inspires them to protect you in turn.  
- **A Smile Opens Most Doors.** Kindness is a currency shared by everyone.  
- **A Journey Is Its Own Reward.** Travel is made better, and faster, when its fun.  

### Oath Spells (Level 3)

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

### Channel Divinity (Level 3)

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

### Escape Route (Level 3)

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to inspire you and up to four other creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you to move. A chosen creature can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, provided that its speed is not 0. If you have already used your Channel Divinity, you can use this option by expending a paladin spell slot of 1st level or higher instead. When you do, the maximum number of creatures you can choose is equal to the level of the spell slot you expended.

Alternatively, you can use this Channel Divinity as a reaction when a creature that you can see within range takes damage. When you do, only that creature can use its reaction in this way.

### Call of the Horizon (Level 3)

As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to invigorate your groups travel. Until you finish a short or long rest, while traveling for an hour or more at a steady pace, difficult terrain does not slow your groups travel, and your travel pace increases by 1 mphâ€”even if traveling by a mount or vehicle. For every 8 hours you travel in this way, the distance you cover is increased by a number of miles equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). In addition, you suffer none of the penalties of traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily even when moving at a normal one. Lastly, affected creatures have advantage on any Constitution saving throw they make as a result of a forced march.

### Aura of Community (Level 7)

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you can magically understand any language spoken by another creature within that range, provided that the affected creatures can also speak at least one language. In addition, you can use a bonus action to take the Help action. When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be anywhere within your aura, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Destined to Roam (Level 15)

By 15th level, your wanderlust can not be kept at bay by others. Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). You can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or another creatures grapple.

### Avatar of the Nomad (Level 20)

At 20th level, your comfort in the world extends to those around you. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or lower that are not constructs or undead are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them; doing so causes this benefit to cease to affect them until you finish a long rest.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to empower your Aura of Community for 1 minute, granting the following benefits to you and any other creature of your choice within it:

- If you start your turn within the aura, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.  
- You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.  
- Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.  

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
