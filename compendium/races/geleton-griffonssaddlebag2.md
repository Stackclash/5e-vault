- **Ability Scores**: Constitution +2, Apply +1 to one of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
- **Size**: Varies
- **Speed**: 30 ft.

## Traits

Your geleton character has a variety of unusual traits that it shares with other geletons.

### Ability Score Increase

Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1—potentially something indicative of your previous life's capabilities.

### Age

Geletons come to life fully matured but may resemble a younger or older creature. Their full life span is unknown, but in general they live for about a century.

### Alignment

Geletons are as likely to be good as they are to be evil. Their personality is molded by the company they keep and the environment around them, especially during the formative months following their Synthesis. Many geletons end up at least partly neutral.

### Size

A geleton's size depends on the skeleton inside of it. You can choose to be either Medium or Small when you select this race.

### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

### Darkvision

Your eyes were magically formed from ooze through the process of your creation, granting you a degree of vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Limited Blindsight

You still retain a small portion of sightless awareness from your ooze heritage. You have [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) out to a range of 5 feet.

### Symbiotic Fortitude

You don't need to breathe. In addition, you have resistance to acid damage and are immune to disease.

### Wakeful

Geletons only need to sleep for a short time each day. Even while sleeping, you remain aware of your immediate surroundings thanks to your limited blindsight. After sleeping for 4 hours, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. This extra language may be one you remember from a previous life.

> [!note] Creating Your Geleton
> 
> When creating your geleton character, use these traits as a guide, rather than a rule. Geletons are naturally resilient thanks to their ooze heritage, which is reflected in the Ability Score Increase and Symbiotic Fortitude traits, but yours may have different strengths. In this case, increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and another by 1, or choose three different ability scores to increase by 1.
> 
> If you feel that 5 feet of blindsight is too powerful for your game, consider instead granting your player's geleton a skill and tool proficiency of their choice. As mentioned in the Ability Score Increase trait, this proficiency could be related to what your geleton did or knew in a previous life.

## Description

Geletons are the living, symbiotic fusion of two semiconscious life forms: oozes and reanimated skeletons. When a skeleton suspended in an ooze is subjected to necromancy that would normally transform it into a mindless thrall, it's possible for the ooze to magically connect to the reanimated body, and its departed life, instead. This event is called Synthesis, and it's through this process that the fragments of life held by ooze and skeleton can come together to form a complete whole. Occasionally called Symblexes for their parallels to other intelligent oozes, geletons are given a rare second chance at life—one that they are as moldable to as their gelatinous forms themselves.

### A Brand New Life

At the start of their new lives, geletons are featureless, ooze-covered humanoids with only a spark of traditional consciousness. Over time, usually about a month, this small consciousness grows into a fully sentient being just like any other. During this period, a geleton's appearance also becomes more discernable, and eventually grows into a humanoid form that feels natural to its budding sense of self. The memories from any of their previous lives are lost in this process, but can resurface in pieces through hazy dreams or waves of déjà vu.

Without a unified culture or history, each geleton's story is unique. Many geletons adopt attitudes similar to those close to them early on in their lives, but others develop strong personalities entirely on their own.

### Dangerous Beginnings

By their very nature, almost all geletons come to life in dangerous places. For however many there are in the world, there are countless more that inevitably perished shortly after their creation. Some unscrupulous figures—typically necromancers or mad scientists—try to use the process of Synthesis for personal gain, but are for the most part stopped whenever they're discovered. Geletons created and held captive in such harrowing conditions for a long time often carry a deep-seated fear or resentment for necromancy, if not all magic, for the remainder of their lives. Other geletons created in such conditions recover faster, especially if they are found and rescued shortly after their Synthesis. Regardless, the origins of virtually all geletons are rife with danger, and those that are brought into safety early in their lives are counted among the most lucky. 

### Unusual Appearance

By far, gelatinous cubes are the most common subject of Synthesis. These clear oozes are known to carry skeletal remains longer than others, and in doing so have a higher chance of becoming a geleton. As a result, most geletons' bodies are similarly translucent. When other oozes like black puddings or ochre jellies undergo Synthesis, the resulting geleton's appearance is typically more opaque.

Regardless of the ooze, a geleton's form always reflects their desired features. Most eventually resemble humans or elves, but when a dragonborn or tiefling skeleton is used in Synthesis, their appearance will often reflect that ancestry in some capacity. Similarly, all geletons have a viscous sheen to their bodies, and though they may have the appearance of hair or eyes, they are still fully gelatinous in nature.

> [!note] A Sum of Dangerous Parts
> 
> Depending on the nature of your campaign, it's safe to assume that most common folk have never seen a geleton before. This is rarely an issue in cosmopolitan cities where even the most unusual races are hardly given a second look, but superstitious villagers and rural townsfolk may see a geleton as a creature of mere ooze and bone rather than as a complete person. This can cause friction in some cases, and outright panic in others. Geletons that travel to these places with other creatures, especially those that resemble more common humanoids, can usually avoid any issues if at least one of their companions is with them.

### Geleton Names

Geletons tend to choose names that are important to them and are independent of the gender that they eventually choose to assume, if any. These names may be based on items that were nearby when they gained sentience, or could even be based on names they dimly remember. Geletons that are rescued or become part of an adventuring party early in their lives may choose to adopt or modify a name given to them by an ally, rather than create one from scratch.
