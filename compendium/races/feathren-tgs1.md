### Age

Young feathren are born from eggs and mature more quickly than humans do, reaching maturity by age 8 and typically living to be around 70.

### Alignment

Feathren can be mercurial and admire variety and expression, and as a result tend to lean towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They are more often good than not, although some allow their vanity to turn to greed and evil.

### Size

Feathren typically range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall with a range of builds based on their ancestry. Your size is Medium.

### Darkvision

Your mix of predatory blood has given you eyes that can cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Natural Creator

You have proficiency in two artisan's tools of your choice, and can gain proficiency in a new tool in half the normal amount of time.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. When choosing a language to study, feathren tend to value the sounds they make more highly than their practicality.

## Description

> [!quote] A quote from Vyrre Olmeck  
> 
> Reil's talons moved quickly across the surface, tearing through concepts with her charcoal on the paper as easily as flesh. Her piercing eyes darted about the page in search of ideas to explore. Finding none, she moved to a new sheet and put the old one atop the stack to the side.
> 
> She stared at the now empty parchment in front of her and twirled the stick of charcoal in her hand. Her feathers were ruffled and the rings on her swinging tail clinked softly as they moved back and forth in concentration.
> 
> The sound of hammers against metal could be heard from workshop below, resonating with a familiar rhythm and ring that matched the pace of her thought, charcoal, and tail. She was a pendulum in motion: a clock that counted down to the stroke of brilliance, and when it rang out, the satisfied trills of victory would echo throughout the chamber.

Feathren are the representation of something new from something old. A step beyond their ancestral griffon heritage, these bipedal creatures celebrate their individuality amidst the cries and jeers from common folk. Originally born from the Astral Plane, where all things can be lost, found, and remade, feathren now walk the Material Plane in search of new ideas, materials, and direction. Filled with endless curiosity, many make their way through the world as adventurers and artisans, taking care to learn what they can from their experiences before moving on to the next one.

### Varied Heritage

Feathren unite remarkable aspects of two otherwise disparate species. Their strong legs are feline, while their chest, arms, and head are avian. Despite their distant relation to griffons, feathren stand upright as and can use their sharp talons to manipulate objects as deftly as any other humanoid. Their voices often bear some bird-like resemblance to their ancestry and contain the occasional trill, coo, or caw.

Few feathren look the same. Their fur, plumage, and build can vary widely, forming unique combinations of origin and aptitude. While some feathren are born with the body of an eagle and lion, others combine the likes of owls and crows with tigers and leopards. Feathren find particular pleasure in jewelry and decoration: an inescapable personality trait from their heritage. Without wings to embellish, most turn to adorning themselves with baubles and rings on their talons, feathered ears, and tail. Others enjoy body art, such as tattoos, paints, and other unique means of self-expression. Most feathren struggle to resist the urge to preen or adjust their worn finery whenever they catch a glimpse of their reflection.

### Confident and Curious

Born with the innate gifts of two naturally skilled creatures, feathren have a shared sense of confidence in their abilities. Feathren spend their lives learning and mastering new trades to sate their curiosity, preferring to answer a puzzle or question on their own rather than ask for help. Many feathren find camaraderie among those that share a common passion, and while they're remiss to turn to peers for help, they enjoy the sharing of stories and conversation about their interests.

### Feathren Names

As is their nature, feathren enjoy experimenting with names and playing with the combinations they can make with them. Feathren are given a name at birth that's used as a first name, but give themselves new surnames as they grow.

Throughout a feathren's lifespan, they may go through as many as twenty surnames: some may last for years, while others are kept for mere weeks. These names are typically combinations of words that describe them and act as either loose titles or personal mantras, and can come from a variety of languages.

- **Male Names.** Acero, Astraios, Caicias, Cleve, Fhyriad, Gyrin, Iapet, Ipsideo, Jurat, Klost, Lostro, Quyll, Ronta, Strey, Untreyo, Yulla, Zwayne  
- **Female Names.** Accra, Axellia, Coora, Ereya, Finneli, Fuli, Herata, Hyla, Juip, Leies, Lucine, Lustra, Monit, Omi, Parra, Reyda, Velrin  
- **Example Surnames.** Birthwoven, Crownfeather, Downy, Gemcrest, Ghostwing, Goldtail, Mistwalker, Ricket, Rightedge, Starborn, Wavecrushed  

> [!note] Friends, Foes, and Feathren
> 
> Despite their intelligence, many people see feathren as little more than walking, talking griffons. As a result, they're often treated with the same caution their large ancestors receive, but unless given a reason to be afraid, most people will simply steal glances at them from across the way or avoid them all together. Someone familiar with griffons can be as likely to belittle a feathren as they are to befriend them, depending on that person's history.
> 
> Those that see past a feathren's ancestry find themselves with a lasting companion. Dragonborn, dwarves, gnomes, and half-elves in particular are likely to be befriended by feathren, who see them as either natural creative peers or kindred spirits caught between worlds. Half-orcs and tieflings can spark this same sense of camaraderie, but often lack the creative drive that can cement a lifelong friendship.
