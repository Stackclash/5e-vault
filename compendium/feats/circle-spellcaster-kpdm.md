# Circle Spellcaster
*Source: Deep Magic p. 234*  

***Prerequisites*** The ability to cast at least one spell

You have learned to create a circular flow of magic between yourself and an allied spellcaster to bolster your spells. You gain the following benefits:

- You can spend 2 hours (which can be during a long rest) creating a mystical bond with another spellcaster. Both of you must spend this time in meditation, and you must remain within 10 feet of each other. The bond goes into effect when the meditation is over (or when you finish your long rest). Once the bond is formed, the two of you can bolster one another's magic. When one of you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, the other can use his or her reaction to help maintain the effect. Both of you make the saving throw. If either save is successful, the caster maintains concentration. If both saves are failed, both of you lose concentration on any spells you are maintaining and each of you takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage from the strain. You can maintain this bond with only one spellcaster at a time. If you create a new bond, the previous one breaks. Otherwise, the bond lasts until you finish your next long rest.
