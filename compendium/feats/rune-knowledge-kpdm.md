# Rune Knowledge
*Source: Deep Magic p. 237*  

***Prerequisites*** Wisdom 12 or higher

You are wise in the lore of two [runes](compendium/lists/list-optfeaturetype-rune.md) of your choice. You always have access to the benefit that a rune provides. In addition, you can invoke one rune power of each rune you have learned, provided you meet any other requirements such as a minimum level.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain the benefit and powers of two additional [runes](compendium/lists/list-optfeaturetype-rune.md) of your choice.
