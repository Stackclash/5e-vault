# Script Sage
*Source: Deep Magic p. 215*  

Through dedicated study, you have mastered one hieroglyph of your choice. Choose one [hieroglyph](compendium/lists/list-optfeaturetype-hieroglyph.md) that you have already learned through [Script Carver](compendium/feats/script-carver-kpdm.md). You can invoke one of its mastery powers, provided you meet any other requirements, such as a minimum level.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you learn the mastery powers of a different hieroglyph from your repertoire.
