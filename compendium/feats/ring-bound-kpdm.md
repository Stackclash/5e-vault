# Ring-bound
*Source: Deep Magic p. 234*  

***Prerequisites*** The ability to cast at least one spell

You have acquired a magic-imbued ring as a token of respect. You gain the following benefits from the ring:

- You have advantage on saving throws against transmutation spells.  
- You can physically bind your ring to a weapon with 1 hour of work that can be completed during a short rest. While the ring is attached to the weapon, you can use a bonus action to make the weapon magical until the start of your next turn. After activating this ability twice, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.  
- [Ring wardens](compendium/classes/wizard-ring-warden-kpdm.md) and others who respect the traditions of ring magic are favorably disposed toward you. Their starting attitude toward you automatically improves by one step, and you have advantage on Charisma checks related to social interaction with such individuals.
