# Resourceful
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 146*  

You've always hated leaving anything to waste and have always made sure you get the most out of any situation.

- You gain proficiency in the [harvesting kit](compendium/items/harvesting-kit-hhhvi.md) and the [herbalism kit](compendium/items/herbalism-kit.md).  
- You ignore any penalties for harvesting a creature that died a "particularly violent death".  
- Both "appraising" and "harvesting" a creature take half the time than it normally would.
