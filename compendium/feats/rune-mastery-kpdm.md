# Rune Mastery
*Source: Deep Magic p. 237*  

You have mastered the special powers of one rune. Choose one [rune](compendium/lists/list-optfeaturetype-rune.md) that you have already learned through [Rune Knowledge](compendium/feats/rune-knowledge-kpdm.md). You can invoke one of its mastery powers, provided you meet any other requirements such as a minimum level.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you learn the mastery powers of a different rune from your repertoire.
