## Concentration
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 203_

Some spells require you to maintain [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration) in order to keep their magic active. If you lose [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration), such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration), that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration) at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration). The following factors can break [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration):

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration) on a spell if you cast another spell that requires [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration). You can't concentrate on two spells at once.  
- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration) on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration). The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.  
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration) on a spell if you are [incapacitated](compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) or if you die.  

The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain [concentration](compendium/rules/status.md#concentration) on a spell.
