# Conditions

## Blinded
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 290. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

- A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.  
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.  

## Charmed
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 290. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.  
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.  

## Concentration
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 203. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

Some spells require you to maintain [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) in order to keep their magic active. If you lose [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration), such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration), that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration). The following factors can break [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration):

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell if you cast another spell that requires [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration). You can't concentrate on two spells at once.  
- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are [concentrating](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration). The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.  
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell if you are [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or if you die.  

The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain [concentration](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell.

## Deafened
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 290. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.  

## Drunkenness
_Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 274_

Drinking alcohol is a common pastime and element of many social encounters. However, consuming too much alcohol causes a creature to become drunk. At the GM's discretion, this drunkenness can be measured in six levels using the following rules. A creature gains one level of drunkenness whenever it has a number of alcoholic drinks within 1 hour equal to 2 + half its Constitution modifier, rounded up (a minimum of 2 drinks per hour).

While a creature has at least one level of drunkenness, it gains a bonus to saving throws it makes against being [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) equal to its level of drunkenness, and the DC required to intimidate it increases by the same amount. However, the creature also suffers a penalty to certain rolls equal to its drunkenness level. The kinds of rolls that suffer these penalties, as well as other effects of drunkenness, are shown in the table below.

**Drunkenness Level Table**

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Penalty to Wisdom ([Insight](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Insight) and [Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks |
| 2 | Penalty to Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as well as Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration |
| 3 | Penalty to ability checks that don't use Charisma |
| 4 | Penalty to attack rolls and Charisma checks |
| 5 | Speed halved, can't concentrate on spells |
| 6 | [Unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), and can't remember the events of the last hour. |
^drunkenness-level-table

Optional Footer

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of drunkenness as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 drunkenness has a âˆ’2 penalty to Wisdom ([Insight](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Insight) and [Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks, Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. However, it also gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against being [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and its DC to resist being intimidated increases by 2.

Certain creatures have a tolerance to alcohol that's either natural or practiced. A creature that has resistance to poison damage or has advantage on saving throws against poison must drink twice the amount of alcohol as normal to gain one level of drunkenness. A creature immune to poison damage or the [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition can't become drunk against their will. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, a creature may need to drink additional alcohol to gain levels of drunkenness as a result of building up a natural tolerance from drinking it frequently over time.

When a conscious creature starts its turn with level 6 drunkenness, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). On a success, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. When it does, the creature loses 1 level of drunkenness. The DC for this saving throw increases by 5 each time the creature repeats the save before it loses all of its levels of drunkenness.

For every hour the creature doesn't drink any alcohol, it loses one level of drunkenness, provided it's either [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) or has also ingested some food or water. Finishing a long rest removes any levels of drunkenness unless the creature fell [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the duration of the rest as a result of suffering level 6 drunkenness. In that case, the creature loses `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) + 2 levels of drunkenness instead and doesn't regain Hit Dice as a result of finishing a long rest.

## Exhaustion
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 291. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Disadvantage on ability checks |
| 2 | Speed halved |
| 3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4 | Hit point maximum halved |
| 5 | Speed reduced to 0 |
| 6 | Death |
^level-effect

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.

## Frightened

## Surprised
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 189. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A [gelatinous cube](compendium/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube.md) glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is [surprised](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Surprised) at the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be [surprised](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Surprised) even if the other members aren't.

## Void Taint
_Source: Deep Magic p. 333_

Void taint is a measure of how much the Void's influence has seeped into and corrupted a creature's essence. Accumulating too much Void taint causes madness and physical debilitation.

Whenever a creature is exposed to Void taint, it risks losing a small piece of itself to that influence. The Void attacks the very reality of the exposed creature, overwriting a fragment of its personal reality with a twisted version. An exposed creature must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC based on the severity of the exposure, as described on the Void Exposure table.

On a successful save, the creature might be shaken or upset by the experience, but suffers no ill effects. Once a creature has succeeded on a saving throw against a particular kind of Void exposure, it is unaffected by further exposures of the same type until it finishes a long rest.

**Void Exposure**

| Creature... | Charisma Save DC |
|-------------|------------------|
| finishes a rest within a Void-tainted area | 10 |
| learns Void-tainted lore | 10 |
| attunes to a Void-tainted magic item | 15 |
| learns a mythos magic or Void magic spell | 10 + spell level |
| is subjected to a mythos magic or Void magic spell of 6th level or higher | Caster's spell save DC |
| encounters a creature of the Void for the first time | 10 + creature's Charisma modifier |
| is exposed to the Void itself | 20 |
^void-exposure

On a failed save, the creature gains 1 point of Void taint. A creature can accumulate an amount of Void taint equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier (minimum of 2 points) without harm. When a creature's Void taint exceeds that number, it is afflicted with a form of indefinite madness and its Void taint total resets to 0. To determine which type of madness emerges, refer to the [Indefinite Madness](compendium/tables/indefinite-madness-kpdm.md) table.

Instead of bearing this scar on its psyche, a creature can choose to channel the Void's influence into a physical change, known as a flesh warp. The Void can produce an infinite variety of these effects, ranging from subtle to terrifying; the [Flesh Warps](compendium/tables/flesh-warps-kpdm.md) table offers a number of possibilities. A creature that has any flesh warp has disadvantage on Charisma checks involving a creature not of the Void for any purpose other than intimidation.

On either the [Indefinite Madness](compendium/tables/indefinite-madness-kpdm.md) table or the [Flesh Warps](compendium/tables/flesh-warps-kpdm.md) table, a die roll dictates the outcome unless the GM decides otherwise. Under no circumstances should a player be allowed to choose a desired result.

**Curing Flesh Warps and Void Taint.** A [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell removes 1 point of Void taint from the target, in addition to curing the target's indefinite madness, if the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.

Flesh warps are permanent manifestations of the Void within the body of a tainted creature and are incredibly difficult to remove. A [regenerate](compendium/spells/regenerate.md) spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a creature of a flesh warp.
