# Incorporating Artificers
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 108* 

If you have incorporated Artificers into your campaign, you may use the following rules changes to make them compatible with these books:

- Artificers may craft items that are listed with the [artificer](compendium/optional-features/artificer-hhhvi.md) tag in their crafting requirements. Artificers that have chosen the [Alchemist](compendium/classes/artificer-alchemist-tce.md) subclass may also craft items that are listed with the [alchemist](compendium/optional-features/alchemist-hhhvi.md) tag in their crafting requirements.  
- [Harvesting kits](compendium/items/harvesting-kit-hhhvi.md) count as artisan tools for the sake of learning tool proficiencies when the choosing this class as well as for the [The Right Tool for the Job](compendium/classes/artificer-tce.md#The%20Right%20Tool%20for%20the%20Job%20(Level%203)) feature.  
- Artificers may choose to have the [harvesting kit](compendium/items/harvesting-kit-hhhvi.md) in their starting equipment instead of the [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) or [dungeoneer's pack](compendium/items/dungeoneers-pack.md).
