# Fireball Variants
*Source: Deep Magic p. 352* 

[Fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) is perhaps the most iconic damage-dealing spell in fantasy RPGs, so why mess with it? Partly to add an interesting twist to something familiar, partly to give it a story or character spin, and partly just for fun. Here are three options to consider for source=KPDM used by your PC or NPC casters.

## Appearance and Type Changes

[Fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) can be easily spiced up by changing its appearance and damage type. The following table offers twenty options for reskinning [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md); roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) or choose the options that best suit the character who's casting the spell. The new appearance can become emblematic of that caster, as personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a distinctive facial feature.

All items created by a variant appearance vanish as soon as their damage is done; no items or materials can be recovered.

## Power Changes

[Fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) is an instantaneous spell, but it might just as easily resemble [heat metal](compendium/spells/heat-metal.md), with a round of warning, a round of damage, and a round of additional damage. Spreading out the damage this way could be called a [slow-burn fireball](compendium/spells/slow-burn-fireball-kpdm.md). Though this is a bit more bookkeeping, such a spell would be appropriate for limited use by a pyromaniacal spellcasting NPC.

While [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md) is an area of effect spell, a smaller version could attack a single target. This might be called [solitary fireball](compendium/spells/solitary-fireball-kpdm.md), and could easily find a place in an elementalist's spellbook or in the hands of a fire [imp](compendium/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) or an [efreet](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md).

Finally, the third variant here is a [bouncing fireball](compendium/spells/bouncing-fireball-kpdm.md), which (as the name implies) strikes one location, then bounces according to the caster's direction to a second location and explodes again. This is similar to how [chain lightning](compendium/spells/chain-lightning.md) works, but [bouncing fireball](compendium/spells/bouncing-fireball-kpdm.md) attacks multiple targets in both locations. The tradeoff is lower damage against each creature when compared to [chain lightning](compendium/spells/chain-lightning.md).
