# Cursed Gift
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, an object worth at least 75 gp
- **Duration:** 24 hour

This spell imbues an object with a harmful magical effect that you or another creature in physical contact with you is currently suffering from. If you give this object to a creature that freely accepts it during the duration of the spell, the recipient must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the harmful effect is transferred to the recipient for the duration of the spell (or until the effect ends).

Returning the object to you, destroying it, or giving it to someone else has no effect. [Remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) and comparable magic can relieve the individual who received the item, but the harmful effect still returns to the previous victim when this spell ends if the effect's duration has not expired.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 24 hours for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
