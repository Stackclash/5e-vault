# Dark Web of the Spider Monarch
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet cube)
- **Components:** V, S, a thread of black silk
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 30-foot cube centered on you, fills with sticky, night-black webbing. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure the area. You are unaffected by the aforementioned effects of the webs and gain a climbing speed of 30 feet when moving on the webs.

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters the webs during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

Each turn that you are in the webs, you can use a bonus action to siphon life force from every creature [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the webs. Each creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

A creature [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, it is no longer [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).

The webs are not flammable, but are susceptible to radiant damage. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to radiant damage dissipates to nothing in 1 round.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock)
