# Unruly Item
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You animate an object in the possession of a creature within range, giving the object limited movement and a compulsion to thwart its possessor. The effect of the spell varies depending on the kind of object you affect.

**Weapon:** A weapon being wielded by a creature fights and twists, trying to free itself from the creature's grasp. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on any attacks it makes in that round with the weapon. On a save that fails by 5 or more, the creature drops the weapon.

**Armor:** The creature's armor shifts and moves, becoming noisy and uncomfortable. If the armor does not normally impart disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks, it does so while this spell is in effect. The creature wearing it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take a 10-foot penalty to its speed and be unable to use the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action.

**Other Items:** The effects on other carried items can vary at the GM's discretion. A potion might behave as a weapon, trying not to be drunk, falling to the ground and becoming ruined if the Dexterity save is failed by 5 or more. A backpack might try to empty itself, disgorging a random item each round on a failed save.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
