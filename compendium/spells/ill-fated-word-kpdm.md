You call out a distracting epithet to a creature, worsening its chance to succeed at whatever it's doing. Roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that the target has just made; the target uses the lowered result to determine the outcome of its roll.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
