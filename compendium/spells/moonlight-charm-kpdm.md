# Moonlight Charm
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 4 week

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid remains [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) until the spell's duration expires, until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it, or until a full moon rises in the sky. The [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
