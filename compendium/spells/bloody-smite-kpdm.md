# Bloody Smite
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time during the spell's duration that you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, your weapon pulses with a dull red light, and the attack deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage to the target. Until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage, it bleeds profusely from the mouth, and it can't speak intelligibly or cast spells that have a verbal component. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or an ally within 5 feet of it uses an action to tend the wound and makes a successful Wisdom ([Medicine](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check against your spell save DC, or if the target receives magical healing, the spell ends.
