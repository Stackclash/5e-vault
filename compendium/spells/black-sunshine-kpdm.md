# Black Sunshine
*8th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet radius)
- **Components:** V, a discolored pearl, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You hold up a flawed pearl and it disappears, leaving behind a magic orb in your hand that pulses with dim purple light. Allies that you designate become [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) if they're within 60 feet of you and if light from the orb can reach the space they occupy. An [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature still casts a faint, purple shadow.

The orb can be used as a thrown weapon to attack an enemy. On a hit, the orb explodes in a flash of light and the spell ends. The targeted enemy and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute. A creature [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
