# Sun's Bounty
*5th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

The sun's life-giving energy heals and sustains your body or that of a creature you touch. For the duration, you heal 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns whenever you are bathed in direct sunlight; 30 minutes or more of exposure also provides a day's normal nourishment.

In dim light, the spell's healing is reduced to 1 hit point per minute. Normal or magical darkness suppresses the spell's effect entirely. While in sunlight, the target can ignore one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). (The level is only temporarily removed.)

Undead are especially vulnerable to this spell. If a targeted undead fails its Wisdom save, it gains the [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition and suffers radiant damage instead of healing while in sunlight.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
