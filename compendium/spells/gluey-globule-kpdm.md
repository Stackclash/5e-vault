# Gluey Globule
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a drop of glue
- **Duration:** 1 minute,  up to 1 hour

You make a ranged spell attack to hurl a large globule of sticky, magical glue at a creature within 120 feet. If the attack hits, the target creature is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). A [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can break free by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. When the creature breaks free, it takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) slashing damage from the glue tearing its skin. If your ranged spell attack roll was a critical hit or exceeded the target's AC by 5 or more, the Strength saving throw is made with disadvantage. The target can also be freed by an application of [universal solvent](compendium/items/universal-solvent.md) or by taking 20 acid damage. The glue dissolves when the creature breaks free or at the end of 1 minute.

Alternatively, this spell can also be used to glue an object to a solid surface or to another object. In this case, the spell works like a single application of [sovereign glue](compendium/items/sovereign-glue.md) and lasts for 1 hour.
