# Power Word Kneel
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, an emerald worth at least 100 gp
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you shout this word of power, creatures within 20 feet of a point you specify are compelled to kneel down facing you. A kneeling creature is treated as [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). Up to 55 hit points of creatures are affected, beginning with those that have the fewest hit points. A kneeling creature makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. The effect ends immediately on any creature that takes damage while kneeling.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
