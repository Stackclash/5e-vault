# Potency of the Pack
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 25 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a few hairs from a wolf
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You bestow lupine traits on a group of living creatures that you designate within range. Choose one of the following benefits to be gained by all targets for the duration:

- **Thick Fur..** Each target sprouts fur over its entire body, giving it a +2 bonus to Armor Class.  
- **Keen Hearing and Smell..** Each target has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing or smell.  
- **Pack Tactics..** Each affected creature has advantage on an attack roll against a target if at least one of the attacker's allies (also under the effect of this spell) is within 5 feet of the target of the attack and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).  

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 minute for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock)
