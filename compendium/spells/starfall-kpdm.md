# Starfall
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause bolts of shimmering starlight to fall from the heavens, striking up to five creatures that you can see within range. Each bolt strikes one target, dealing `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) radiant damage, knocking the target [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone), and blinding it until the start of your next turn. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage, is not knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone), and is not [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded). If you name fewer than five targets, excess bolts strike the ground harmlessly.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can create one additional bolt for each slot level above 5th.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
