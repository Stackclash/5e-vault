# Aspect of the Ram
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You take on the aspect of a ram, including some physical attributes. Your body hair grows thick and woolly, and a curling pair of horns sprouts from your head. You can make a ram attack with these horns as an action, and you are proficient with this attack. You deal `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and hit with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC or be knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

You ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble, ice sheets, scree, or steep slopes. You also gain advantage on Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks made while climbing or jumping, and Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) checks made for balance or to stay on your feet.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
