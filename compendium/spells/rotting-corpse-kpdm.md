# Rotting Corpse
*2nd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, a rotting piece of flesh from an undead creature
- **Duration:** 3 day

Your familiarity with the foul effects of death allows you to prevent a dead body from being returned to life using anything but the most powerful forms of magic.

You cast this spell by touching a creature that died within the last 24 hours. The body immediately decomposes to a state that prevents the body from being returned to life by the [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md) spell (though a [resurrection](compendium/spells/resurrection.md) spell still works). At the end of this spell's duration, the body decomposes to a rancid slime, and it can't be returned to life except through a [true resurrection](compendium/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional corpse for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
