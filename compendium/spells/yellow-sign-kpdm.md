# Yellow Sign
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Special

You attempt to afflict a humanoid you can see within range with memories of distant, alien realms and their peculiar inhabitants. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with a form of long-term madness and be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you for `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) hours or until you or one of your allies harms it in any way. While [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, the creature regards you as a sacred monarch. If you or an ally of yours is fighting the creature, it has advantage on its saving throw.

A successful [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell ends both effects.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard)
