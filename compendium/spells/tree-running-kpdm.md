# Tree Running
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, a maple catkin
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

One willing creature you touch gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. This climbing speed functions only while the creature is in contact with a living plant or fungus that's growing from the ground. The creature can cling to an appropriate surface with just one hand or with just its feet, leaving its hands free to wield weapons or cast spells. The plant doesn't give under the creature's weight, so the creature can walk on the tiniest of tree branches, stand on a leaf, or run across the waving top of a field of wheat without bending a stalk or touching the ground.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
