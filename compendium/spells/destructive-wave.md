# Destructive Wave
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) thunder damage, as well as `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-tempest-domain)
