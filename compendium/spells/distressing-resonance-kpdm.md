# Distressing Resonance
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a field of subsonic vibrations in a 30-foot-radius sphere, centered on a point you choose within range, that causes physical distress and extreme discomfort. A creature in this area or that enters it after you cast the spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until the beginning of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature can act normally. If a creature begins its turn in the area, it must make another successful save to avoid being [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). Constructs, [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) creatures, oozes, plants, and undead are not affected by this spell.

The vibrations from the distressing resonance interfere with tremorsense, negating any use of that ability in the spell's area.
