# Ravages of Time
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a wilted flower
- **Duration:** 24 hour

You accelerate the aging of one creature within range, causing it to take on the state of a decrepit version of its type. The target suffers three levels of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) that cannot be removed by normal means. A [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell partially reverses the effect of this spell, removing one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). Constructs and undead are unaffected by this spell, and creatures who live to great age without negative effects, such as dragons, are also unaffected.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
