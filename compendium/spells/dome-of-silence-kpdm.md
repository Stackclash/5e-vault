# Dome of Silence
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

An [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) dome encompasses a 10-foot-radius around you, creating a damper for any sound traveling into or out of the area. Creatures can pass through the dome normally, but sound does not. You and any creatures in the dome can hear one another, but nothing outside. Likewise, any noise made in the dome of silence cannot be heard outside it.

Any attack that deals thunder damage dispels the dome, but the dome reduces that damage to any creatures inside it by half.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Cleric (Moon Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-moon-domain-kpdm)
