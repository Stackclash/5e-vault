Myriad Tiny objects animate at your command, forming a swarm. The objects' abilities conform to the rules stated in the [animate objects](compendium/spells/animate-objects.md) spell, except that you animate only Tiny objects, which gather together into a Medium swarm.

The area of the swarm is considered difficult terrain, and creatures in it are lightly obscured. The swarm has the following statistics: [animated object swarm](compendium/bestiary/construct/animated-object-swarm-kpdm.md)
