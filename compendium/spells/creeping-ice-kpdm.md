# Creeping Ice
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sheet of ice that covers a 5-foot square within range and lasts for the spell's duration. The iced area is difficult terrain.

A creature in the area where you cast the spell must make a successful Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by ice that rapidly encases it. A creature [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the ice takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage at the start of its turn. A [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success, but it has disadvantage on this check. The creature can also be freed (and the spell ended) by dealing at least 20 damage to the ice. The [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature takes half the damage from any attacks against the ice.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th to 6th level, the area increases to a 10-foot square, the ice deals `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) cold damage, and 40 damage is needed to melt each 5-foot square.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the area increases to a 20-foot square, the ice deals `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) cold damage, and 60 damage is needed to melt each 5-foot square.
