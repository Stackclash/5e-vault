# Thunderous Stampede
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell acts as [thunderous charge](compendium/spells/thunderous-charge-kpdm.md), but affecting up to three targets within range, including yourself. A target other than you must use its reaction to move and attack under the effect of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the distance your targets can move increases by 10 feet, and the attack deals an additional `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` thunder damage, for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
