# Mass Surge Dampener
*5th-level, Abjuration (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute, Until dispelled

Using your strength of will, you protect up to three creatures other than yourself from the effect of a chaos magic surge. A protected creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally allowed. Once a protected creature makes a successful saving throw affected by this spell, the spell's effect ends for that creature.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
