# Greater Maze
*9th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

This spell functions as [maze](compendium/spells/maze.md), but the target must make a Dexterity saving throw each time it starts its turn in the maze. The target takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

Escaping this maze is especially difficult. To do so, the target must use an action to make a DC 20 Intelligence check. It escapes when it makes its second successful check.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
