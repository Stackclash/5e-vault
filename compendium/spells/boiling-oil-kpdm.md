# Boiling Oil
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a vial of oil
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a shallow, 15-foot-radius pool of boiling oil centered on a point within range. The pool is difficult terrain, and any creature that enters the pool or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) fire damage and falls [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
