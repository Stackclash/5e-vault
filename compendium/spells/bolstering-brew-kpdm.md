Calling upon the patron deity of brewers, you bring forth a vibrant brew of beer or ale. Up to six other creatures within range can partake of this drink with you and share in its magical benefits, each drawing a mug from the small keg of magical brew that appears. A creature that downs a mug of magical beer gains advantage on either all Strength checks or all Charisma checks (chosen when it drinks), is immune to being [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and makes all Constitution saving throws with advantage. These benefits last for 8 hours.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Cleric (Beer Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-beer-domain-kpdm)
