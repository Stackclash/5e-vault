# Freeze Blood
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, you must make a melee spell attack against a living creature with a circulatory system. On a hit, the creature's blood freezes. For the spell's duration, the affected creature's speed is halved and it takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. If the creature takes bludgeoning damage from a critical hit, the attack's damage dice are rolled three times instead of twice.

At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
