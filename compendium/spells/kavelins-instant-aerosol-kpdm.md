# Kavelin's Instant Aerosol
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a candle made with rare herbs and powdered gemstones, worth 50 gp
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You light a specially prepared candle and place it beneath an open potion as you cast this spell. The potion is vaporized into a cloud that extends out five feet from you in all directions. All creatures in range, including yourself, that breathe in the magical vapors can benefit from the effects of the potion. The duration is divided equally among those partaking, rounding down any fractions. If the spell is used with a [potion of healing](compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md), all creatures in the area receive the average number of hit points that would be healed by a potion of that type.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
