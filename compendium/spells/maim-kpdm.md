# Maim
*5th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Your hands become black claws bathed in necrotic energy. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage and a section of its body of your choosing withers:

**Upper Limb**. The target has disadvantage on Strength ability checks, and, if it has the Multiattack action, it has disadvantage on its first attack roll each round.

**Lower Limb**. The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks.

**Body**. Choose one damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The target loses its resistance to that damage type. If the target doesn't have resistance to the chosen damage type, it is vulnerable to that damage type instead. The effect is permanent until removed by [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md), [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md), or similar magic.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
