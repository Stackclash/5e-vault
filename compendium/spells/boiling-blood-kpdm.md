# Boiling Blood
*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a vial of blood
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause the blood within a creature's body to boil with supernatural heat. Choose one creature that you can see within range that isn't a construct or an undead. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage and the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) fire damage and is [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded). At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the creature takes an additional `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage and remains [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded).

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
