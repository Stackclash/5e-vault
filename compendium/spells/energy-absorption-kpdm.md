# Energy Absorption
*5th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A creature you touch has resistance to acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, and thunder damage until the spell ends. If the spell is used against an unwilling creature, you must make a melee spell attack with a reach of 5 feet. If the attack hits, for the duration of the spell the affected creature must make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability whenever it casts a spell that deals one of the given damage types. On a failed save, the spell is not cast but its slot is expended; on a successful save, the spell is cast but its damage is halved before applying the effects of saving throws, resistance, and other factors.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
