# Hard Heart
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, an iron key
- **Duration:** 10 minute

You imbue your touch with the power to make a creature aloof, hardhearted, and unfeeling. The creature you touch as part of casting this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw unless it's currently [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed). On a successful save, this spell fails. On a failed save, the target becomes immune to being [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) for the duration; if it's currently [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), that effect ends. In addition, Charisma checks against the target are made with disadvantage for the spell's duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, the duration increases to 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
