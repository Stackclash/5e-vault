# Salt Lash
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a pinch of salt worth 1 sp, which is consumed during the casting
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You create a long, thin blade of razor-sharp salt crystals. You can wield it as a longsword, using your spellcasting ability to modify your weapon attack rolls. The sword deals `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) slashing damage on a hit, and any creature struck by the blade must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) by searing pain until the start of your next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to the blade's secondary (stun) effect; plants and creatures composed mostly of water, such as [water elementals](compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md), also take an additional `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage if they fail the saving throw.

The spell lasts until you stop concentrating on it, the duration expires, or you let go of the blade for any reason.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
