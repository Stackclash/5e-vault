# Absorbing Field
*6th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cloak yourself in a protective field that absorbs incoming magic, rejuvenating your spell slots. When you are the target of a spell (including spells that affect multiple targets, but not area spells such as fireball), make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell has no effect on you and is absorbed by the field. You regain a spell slot of the same level as the spell that was cast against you. If you have no expended spell slots of that level, you don't regain a spell slot, but this spell remains in effect.

Even if the spell manages to bypass the field, you gain advantage on your saving throw against the spell, if you need to do one.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
