# Darkbolt
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) cold damage. A target that was hit by one or more rays must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be unable to use reactions until the start of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
