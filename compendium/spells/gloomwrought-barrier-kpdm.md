# Gloomwrought Barrier
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of obsidian
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, you erect a barrier of energy drawn from the realm of death and shadow. This barrier is a wall 20 feet high and 60 feet long, or a ring 20 feet high and 20 feet in diameter. The wall is transparent when viewed from one side of your choice and translucent—lightly obscuring the area beyond it—from the other. A creature that tries to move through the wall must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or stop in front of the wall and become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) until the start of the creature's next turn, when it can try again to move through. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against the wall, it is immune to the effect of this barrier.
