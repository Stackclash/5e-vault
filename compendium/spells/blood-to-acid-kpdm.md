# Blood to Acid
*9th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, you designate a creature within range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:10d12|noform|avg` (`10d12`) acid damage and is [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) by the pain for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and isn't [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

Creatures without blood, such as constructs and plants, are not affected by this spell. If blood to acid is cast on a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a blood elemental or a blood zombie, the creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
