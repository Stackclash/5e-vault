# Sickening Radiance
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) radiant damage, and it suffers one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible). The light and any levels of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
