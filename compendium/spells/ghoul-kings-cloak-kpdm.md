# Ghoul King's Cloak
*8th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, giving it some of the power of a ghoul king. The target gains the following benefits for the duration:

- Its Armor Class increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.  
- When it uses the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action to make a melee weapon attack or a ranged weapon attack, it can make one additional attack of the same kind.  
- It is immune to necrotic damage and radiant damage.  
- It can't be reduced to less than 1 hit point.  

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts for 10 minutes and doesn't require concentration.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock)
