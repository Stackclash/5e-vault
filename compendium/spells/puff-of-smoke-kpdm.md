- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

By harnessing the elemental power of fire, you warp nearby air into obscuring smoke. One creature you can see within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, the creature is [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the start of your next turn. Puff of smoke has no effect on creatures that have tremorsense or [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight).

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer)
