# Raise Questing Dead
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell is identical to [raise dead](compendium/spells/raise-dead.md), except it empowers you to impose a [geas](compendium/spells/geas.md) on the creature you raise. The targeted soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn't restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the 31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it accomplishes the task, it's free to live out the remainder of its restored life as it chooses.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric)
