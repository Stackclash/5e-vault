# Icy Grasp of the Void
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon the cold, inky darkness of the Void into being around a creature that you can see. The target takes `dice:10d10|noform|avg` (`10d10`) cold damage and is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) for the duration; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. A [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature gains one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) at the start of each of its turns. Creatures immune to cold and that do not breathe do not gain [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). A creature [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
