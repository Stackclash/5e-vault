# Recharge
*5th-level, Evocation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a diamond worth at least 250 gp, which is consumed during the casting
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You draw magical energy through yourself as a conduit to recharge a magic item. A single magic item that uses charges and that you are touching at the time of the casting immediately regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) charges. An item cannot receive more than its maximum number of charges, and any excess energy dissipates harmlessly, unless the item in question is capable of a retributive strike. If such an item is charged past its capacity, it explodes as if you had used an action to enact the retributive strike, with all the resulting effects.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you restore 1 additional charge for each slot level above 5th.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
