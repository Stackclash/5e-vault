# Celestial Fanfare
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature trumpet worth 100 gp
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A great blaring of trumpets from on high blasts down upon an area you designate. All evil creatures in a 30-foot radius take `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) thunder damage and `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) radiant damage and are [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) rounds. A successful Constitution saving throw reduces the damage and the duration of the [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) conditions by half.

Neutral or unaligned creatures within the area take half as much damage and are [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for half as many rounds. A successful save reduces the damage to one-quarter and negates the blinding and deafening effects.

Good-aligned creatures are not harmed by this spell.
