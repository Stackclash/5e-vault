# Enthrall
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can't be [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or can no longer speak.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Cleric (Apocalypse Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-apocalypse-domain-kpdm); [Cleric (Dragon Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-dragon-domain-kpdm)
