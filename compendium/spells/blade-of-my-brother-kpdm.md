# Blade of My Brother
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, melee weapon owned by a dead ally of the target
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 4 round

You touch a melee weapon that was used by an ally who is now dead, and it leaps into the air and flies to another ally (chosen by you) within 15 feet of you. The weapon enters that ally's space and moves when the ally moves. If the weapon or the ally is forced to move more than 5 feet from the other, the spell ends.

The weapon acts on your turn by making an attack if a target presents itself. Its attack modifier equals your spellcasting level + the weapon's inherent magical bonus, if any; it receives only its own inherent magical bonus to damage. The weapon fights for up to 4 rounds or until your concentration is broken, after which the spell ends and it falls to the ground.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin)
