# Soothing Chant
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Intoning a lulling drone, you convince creatures not to do you harm. At the beginning of its turn, any creature that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed). A creature [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by this spell can still act aggressively toward your allies. If it uses area attacks, the creature will position them so as not to include you in the area. On a successful save, a creature can act against you normally, but it must make another saving throw in every round when you continue to chant and it can hear you.

On your turn, you can use a bonus action to designate up to six other creatures that the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creatures will not attack.

The effects last for the duration or until you (or any other designated creatures) engage in hostile action against a [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature or in its presence. Any creature that you attack or target with a harmful spell, or that sees you attack or cast a harmful spell against another [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature, is no longer affected by this spell and can act normally against you (or against any creature you designated).

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric)
