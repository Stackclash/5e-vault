# Cherub's Burning Blade
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

A sword made of holy fire blazes to life in your hand. The size and shape of the blade conforms to your will, but it is never larger than a one-handed weapon sized for a Medium creature. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but if you maintain concentration on the spell, you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee attack with the burning blade. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire and `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage. On a critical hit, the target catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The burning blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, both the fire damage and radiant damage increase by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for every two slot levels above 4th.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin)
