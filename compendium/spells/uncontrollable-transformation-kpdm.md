# Uncontrollable Transformation
*7th-level, Transmutation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, the bill of a platypus
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You infuse your body with raw chaos and will it to adopt a helpful mutation. Roll a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) and consult the Uncontrollable Transformation table below to determine what mutation occurs. You can try to control the shifting of your body to gain a mutation you prefer, but doing so is taxing; you can roll a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) twice and choose the result you prefer, but you gain one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). At the end of the spell, your body returns to its normal form.

**Uncontrollable Transformation**

`dice: [](uncontrollable-transformation-kpdm.md#^uncontrollable-transformation)`

| dice: d10 | Mutation |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | A spindly third arm sprouts from your shoulder. As a bonus action, you can use it to attack with a light weapon. You have advantage on Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) checks and any checks that require the manipulation of tools. |
| 2 | Your skin is covered by rough scales that increase your AC by 1 and give you resistance to a random damage type (roll on the [Damage Type](compendium/tables/random-damage-type-kpdm.md) table in the [frenzied bolt](compendium/spells/frenzied-bolt-kpdm.md) spell description). |
| 3 | A puckered orifice grows on your back. You can forcefully expel air from it, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet. You must land at the end of your turn. In addition, as a bonus action, you can try to push a creature away with a blast of air. The target is pushed 5 feet away from you if it fails a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier. |
| 4 | A second face appears on the back of your head. You gain [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet and advantage on sight-based and scent-based Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks. You become adept at carrying on conversations with yourself. |
| 5 | You grow gills that not only allow you to breathe underwater but also filter poison out of the air. You gain immunity to inhaled poisons. |
| 6 | Your hindquarters elongate, and you grow a second set of legs. Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet, and your carrying capacity becomes your Strength score multiplied by 20. |
| 7 | You become incorporeal and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`) force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You can't pick up or interact with physical objects that you weren't carrying when you became incorporeal. |
| 8 | Your limbs elongate and flatten into prehensile paddles. You gain a swimming speed equal to your base walking speed and have advantage on Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks made to climb or swim. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage. |
| 9 | Your head fills with a light gas and swells to four times its normal size, causing your hair to fall out. You have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks and can levitate up to 5 feet above the ground. |
| 10 | You grow three sets of feathered wings that give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to hover. |
