# Sudden Stampede
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a horseshoe
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You conjure up a multitude of fey spirits that manifest as galloping horses. These horses run in a 10-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line, in a given direction starting from a point within range, trampling all creatures in their path, before vanishing again. Each creature in the line takes `dice:6d10|noform|avg` (`6d10`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone). A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half, and the creature is not knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
