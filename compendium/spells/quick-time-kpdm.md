# Quick Time
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, any seed
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You make one living creature or plant within range move rapidly in time compared to you. The target becomes one year older. For example, you could cast this spell on a seedling, which causes the plant to sprout from the soil, or you could cast this spell on a newly hatched duckling, causing it to become a full-grown duck. If the target is a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to resist the aging. It can choose to fail the saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the target's age by one additional year for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid (Circle of Oaks)](list-spells-classes-druid-circle-of-oaks-kpdm)
