# Dark Lord's Mantle
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You infuse yourself with fiendish power, which inspires your allies and intimidates your foes. While the spell lasts, you exude confidence. You gain advantage on saving throws against all enchantment spells and effects. In addition, each ally within 30 feet of you can roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) once per round and add the result to an attack roll as a bonus action, or to a saving throw as a reaction.

An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of you, or that moves within 30 feet of you on its turn, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you. If a creature moves out of the spell's radius, it remains [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) until the start of its next turn, and then the spell ends for that creature. While [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and it cannot be affected again by your casting of this spell for 24 hours.
