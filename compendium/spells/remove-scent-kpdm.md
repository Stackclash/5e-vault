# Remove Scent
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a pinch of charcoal dust or a drop of vinegar
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You magically remove strong odors from an area, person, or object. Up to a 40-foot cube or a single creature or object of up to Large size can be affected. A room full of garbage or carrion ceases to smell, for example, or someone sprayed by a skunk no longer bears the odor. If there is still material producing odors in the area, however, the smell will return within an hour. If cast upon the area of a [stinking cloud](compendium/spells/stinking-cloud.md) spell, it removes the odor and the spell's nauseating qualities, but not the obscuring fog itself.

This spell can also be cast on a single creature of up to Large size, except for one that already gives off a strong odor (such as a [troglodyte](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/troglodyte.md)). For the next hour, the creature has no scent, and it cannot be detected by Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks relying on scent.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
