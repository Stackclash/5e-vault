# Heavenly Crown
*6th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V, S, a small golden crown worth 50 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A glowing, golden crown appears on your head and sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. When you cast the spell (and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, until the spell ends), you can target one willing creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. If the target can hear you, it can use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack and then move up to half its speed, or vice versa.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
