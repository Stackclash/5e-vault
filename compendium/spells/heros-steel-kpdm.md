# Hero's Steel
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a warrior's amulet worth 5 gp
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You infuse the metal of a melee weapon you touch with the fearsome aura of a mighty hero. The weapon's wielder has advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks made while aggressively brandishing the weapon. In addition, an opponent that currently has 30 or fewer hit points and is struck by the weapon must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round. If the creature has more than 30 hit points but fewer than the weapon's wielder currently has, it becomes [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) instead; a [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to castings of this spell on the same weapon for 24 hours.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge)
