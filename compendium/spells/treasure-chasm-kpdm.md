# Treasure Chasm
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a gold coin
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause the glint of a golden coin to haze over the vision of one creature in range. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it sees a gorge, trench, or other hole in the ground, at a spot within range chosen by you, which is filled with gold and treasure. On its next turn, the creature must move toward that spot. When it reaches the spot, it becomes [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), as it devotes all its attention to scooping imaginary treasure into its pockets or a pouch.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends if the creature takes damage from you or one of your allies.

Creatures with the dragon type have disadvantage on the initial saving throw but have advantage on saving throws against this spell made after reaching the designated spot.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer)
