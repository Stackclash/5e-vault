# Wave of Corruption
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V, S, a scrap of rotten meat or plant matter
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, necromantic energy spreads out in a 30-foot radius around you, corrupting what it comes into contact with. Each unattended, nonmagical object within range takes `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) necrotic damage. All food and drink in the area, other than what is being carried, is fouled and made unpalatable. Magic consumables, such as potions, have a 50 percent chance of being ruined, but any such item in the possession of a creature gets a Constitution saving throw using the owner's save bonus to avoid this outcome.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for every two slot levels above 3rd.
