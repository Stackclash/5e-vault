# Animal Spy
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You create a mental link between you and a beast within range. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to transfer your awareness to the beast—using its vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch—and another bonus action on any subsequent turn to return your awareness to your body. You can use an action to dismiss the spell entirely.

This spell affects normal beasts, including giant versions of animals, but not conjured animals or familiars. The spell does not allow you to control the beast or make it friendly to you. While you experience the world through the beast's senses, your body is motionless, unaware of the outside world and effectively [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).

The spell ends if the distance between you and the beast is ever greater than 1 mile, or if the beast is killed. If you are using the beast's senses when it is killed, you must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds from the shock of experiencing its death.
