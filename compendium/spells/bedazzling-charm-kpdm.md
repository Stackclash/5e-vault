# Bedazzling Charm
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid is [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by a third humanoid you designate that both of you can see.

The spell ends after 1 minute, when you or any of your companions do anything harmful to either of the spell's targets, or when the third humanoid disappears from the [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature's sight. The [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature regards the third creature as a friendly acquaintance and will follow it to keep it within sight. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was bedazzled by you to regard the third creature favorably.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
