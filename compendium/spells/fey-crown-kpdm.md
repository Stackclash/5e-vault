# Fey Crown
*5th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, five flowers of different colors
- **Duration:** 1 hour

By channeling the ancient wards of the Seelie Court, you create a crown of five flowers on your head. While wearing this crown, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects and are immune to being [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed). As a bonus action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself). Until the end of its next turn, the chosen creature is [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Each time a chosen creature becomes [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), one of the blossoms in the crown closes. After the last of the blossoms closes, the spell ends at the start of your next turn and the crown disappears.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the crown can have one additional flower for each slot level above 5th. One additional flower is required as a material component for each additional flower in the crown.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock)
