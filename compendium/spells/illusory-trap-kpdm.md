# Illusory Trap
*3rd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a needle and a mirror
- **Duration:** 24 hour

You create the illusion of a trap upon an object you touch, such as a door, a chest, or a 5-foot-square area of floor. A creature specifically looking for traps that examines the object must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage, the spell ends, and the creature realizes that the trap was not real.

On a failed save, the creature believes the object contains a trap. If the creature then tries to disarm or otherwise interact with the trap in order to set it off, it must make a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage and realizes the trap is not real. On a failed check, the creature takes `dice:5d10|noform|avg` (`5d10`) psychic damage and is [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round, believing that it accidentally set off the trap and was injured by it.
