# Blood Tide
*cantrip, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 25 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 4 round

When you cast this spell, a creature you designate within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bleed from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. This bleeding deals no damage but imposes aâ€“2 penalty on the creature's Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

A bleeding creature might attract the attention of creatures such as [stirges](compendium/bestiary/beast/stirge.md), [sharks](compendium/bestiary/beast/reef-shark.md), or giant mosquitoes, depending on the circumstances. A [cure wounds](compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md) spell stops the bleeding early, as does a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check.

The spell's duration increases to 2 minutes when you reach 5th level, to 10 minutes when you reach 11th level, and to 1 hour when you reach 17th level.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Cleric (Death Domain (DMG))](list-spells-classes-cleric-death-domain-dmg); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
