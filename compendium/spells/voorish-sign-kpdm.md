# Voorish Sign
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-feet radius)
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

For the duration, [invisible](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects within 20 feet of you become visible to you, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition. The effect moves with you, remaining centered on you until the duration expires.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 1st.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard)
