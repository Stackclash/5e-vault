# Silence
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](list-spells-classes-druid-circle-of-the-land); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge); [Warlock (The Fathomless)](list-spells-classes-warlock-the-fathomless-tce); [Monk (Way of Shadow)](list-spells-classes-monk-way-of-shadow)
