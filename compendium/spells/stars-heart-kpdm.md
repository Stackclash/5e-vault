# Star's Heart
*9th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V, S, an ioun stone
- **Duration:** 1 minute

This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50-foot radius centered on you. Each creature in the area other than you drops whatever it's holding, falls [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone), becomes [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), and can't move. If a solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling damage. Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) and become [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) and [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:8d6|noform|avg` (`8d6`) bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes half as much damage, it's no longer [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), and it can move at half speed.

All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as [flaming sphere](compendium/spells/flaming-sphere.md). A creature under the influence of a [freedom of movement](compendium/spells/freedom-of-movement.md) spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn't reduced once it recovers from being [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).
