# Lovesick
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a handful of red rose petals
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell causes creatures to behave unpredictably, as they randomly experience the full gamut of emotions of someone who has fallen head over heels in love. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

**Lovesick Actions**

`dice: [](lovesick-kpdm.md#^lovesick-actions)`

| dice: d10 | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| 1-3 | The creature spends its turn moping like a lovelorn teenager; it doesn't move or take actions. |
| 4-5 | The creature bursts into tears, takes the [Dash](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Dash) action, and uses all its movement to run off in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a `dice:d8\|noform\|avg` (`d8`) and assign a direction to each die face. |
| 6 | The creature uses its action to remove one item of clothing or piece of armor. Each round spent removing pieces of armor reduces its AC by 1. |
| 7-8 | The creature drops anything it is holding in its hands and passionately embraces a randomly determined creature. Treat this as a grapple attempt which uses the [Attack](/compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action. |
| 9 | The creature flies into a jealous rage and uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature. |
| 10 | The creature can act and move normally. |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
