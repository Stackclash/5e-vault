# Quicksilver Mantle
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a nonmagical cloak and a dram of quicksilver worth 10 gp
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You transform an ordinary cloak into a highly reflective, silvery garment. This mantle increases your AC by 2 and grants advantage on saving throws against gaze attacks. In addition, whenever you are struck by a ray such as a [ray of enfeeblement](compendium/spells/ray-of-enfeeblement.md), [scorching ray](compendium/spells/scorching-ray.md), or even [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md), roll `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`). On a result of 4, the cloak deflects the ray, which instead strikes a randomly selected target within 10 feet of you. The cloak deflects only the first ray that strikes it each round; rays after the first affect you as normal.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
