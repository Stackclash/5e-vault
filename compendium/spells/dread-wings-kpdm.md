# Dread Wings
*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swarm of flying, bat-like shapes swirl into existence in a 20-foot-radius cloud around the point you target your spell. Each round a creature begins its turn in the swarm, it takes `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. Creatures that are immune to necrotic damage are not susceptible to the [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) effect.

You can use an action on your turn to move the swarm up to 40 feet in any direction.
