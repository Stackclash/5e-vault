You choose up to two creatures within range. Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
