# Extract Essence
*1st-level, Transmutation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a wooden bowl
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

You extract the goodness from food, pulling all the nutritional value out of three days' worth of meals and concentrating it into a tablespoon of bland, flour-like powder. The flour can be mixed with liquid and drunk or baked into bread. When consumed, it still imparts all the nutritional value of the original food.

The original food appears unchanged, and though it's still filling, it has no nutritional value.

## Group Spellcasting

When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, an additional three days' worth of food can be extracted for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum of 27 days' worth of food extracted by the spell.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, you can choose to have each day's worth of meals take the form of a single slice of bread.
