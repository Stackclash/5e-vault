# Breeze Compass
*3rd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a magnetized needle
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

When you cast this spell, you must clearly imagine or mentally describe a location. It doesn't need to be a location you've been to as long as you know it exists on the Material Plane. Within moments, a gentle breeze arises and blows along the most efficient path toward that destination. Only you can sense this breeze, and whenever it brings you to a decision point (a fork in a passageway, for example), you must make a successful DC 8 Intelligence ([Arcana](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to deduce which way the breeze indicates you should go. On a failed check, the spell ends. The breeze guides you around cliffs, lava pools, and other natural obstacles, but it doesn't avoid enemies or hostile creatures.
