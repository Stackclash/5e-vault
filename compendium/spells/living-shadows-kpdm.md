# Living Shadows
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You whisper sibilant words of Void Speech that cause shadows to writhe with unholy life. Choose a point you can see within range. Writhing shadows spread out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, grasping at creatures in the area. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the shadows. A creature that starts its turn [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the shadows must make a successful Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).

A [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Cleric (Void Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-void-domain-kpdm)
