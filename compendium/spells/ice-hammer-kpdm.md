# Ice Hammer
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature hammer carved from ice or glass
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

When you cast this spell, a warhammer fashioned from ice appears in your hands. This weapon functions as a standard [warhammer](compendium/items/warhammer.md) in all ways, except it deals an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) cold damage on a hit. You can drop the warhammer or give it to another creature.

The warhammer melts and is destroyed when it or its user accumulates 20 or more fire damage, or when the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional hammer for each slot level above 2nd. Alternatively, you can create half as many hammers (round down), but each is oversized (`dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) bludgeoning damage, or `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) if wielded with two hands, plus `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) cold damage). Medium or smaller creatures have disadvantage when using oversized weapons, even if they are proficient with them.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Warlock (The Frozen One)](list-spells-classes-warlock-the-frozen-one-kpdm)
