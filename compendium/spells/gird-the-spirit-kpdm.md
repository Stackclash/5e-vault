# Gird the Spirit
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Your magic protects the target creature from the life-sapping energies of the undead. For the duration, the target has immunity to effects from undead creatures that reduce its ability scores, such as a [shadow](compendium/bestiary/undead/shadow.md)'s Strength Drain, or its hit point maximum, such as a [specter](compendium/bestiary/undead/specter.md)'s Life Drain. This spell doesn't prevent damage from those attacks; it prevents only the reduction in ability score or hit point maximum.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge)
