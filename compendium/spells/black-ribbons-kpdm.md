# Black Ribbons
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of ribbon
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You pull pieces of the plane of shadow into your own reality, causing a 20-foot cube to fill with inky ribbons that turn the area into difficult terrain and wrap around nearby creatures. Any creature that ends its turn in the area becomes [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the ribbons until the end of its next turn, unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can't be [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) again by the ribbons, but it's still affected by the difficult terrain.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
