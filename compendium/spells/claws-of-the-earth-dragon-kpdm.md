# Claws of the Earth Dragon
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon the power of an earth dragon and shoot a ray at one target within 60 feet. The target falls [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) and takes `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) bludgeoning damage from being slammed to the ground. (If the target was flying or levitating, it takes an additional `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet it falls.)

If the target makes a successful Strength saving throw, damage is halved, it doesn't fall, and it isn't knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage done by the attack increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` and the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 5th.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge); [Cleric (Dragon Domain)](list-spells-classes-cleric-dragon-domain-kpdm)
