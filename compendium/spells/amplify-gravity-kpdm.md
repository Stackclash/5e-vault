# Amplify Gravity
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of lead
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell intensifies gravity in a 50-foot-radius area within range. Inside the area, damage from falling is quadrupled (`dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) per 5 feet fallen) and maximum damage from falling is `dice:40d6|noform|avg` (`40d6`). Any creature on the ground in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone); the same applies to a creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) creature in the area must make a successful Strength saving throw to stand up. A creature on the ground in the area moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and ranged attack rolls.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
