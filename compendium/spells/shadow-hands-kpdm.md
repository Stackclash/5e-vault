# Shadow Hands
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A freezing blast of shadow explodes out from you in a 10-foot cone. Any creature caught in the shadow takes `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) necrotic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage dealt by the attack increases by `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(2d4)` for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
