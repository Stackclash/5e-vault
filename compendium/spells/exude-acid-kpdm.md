# Exude Acid
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You cause your body to produce a caustic acid. You and anything you were holding or carrying when the spell is cast is immune to the acid. While the spell is active, you can make a melee attack roll against a target, dealing `dice:4d4|noform|avg` (`4d4`) acid damage on a hit. If you are grappling a creature, it takes the acid damage every round on your turn, as if you had made a successful attack. If you are [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by a creature, or [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) or immobilized by physical means (ropes, chains, or similar restraints), the creature or the restraints takes the acid damage each round.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
