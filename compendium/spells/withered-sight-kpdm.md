# Withered Sight
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a dried lizard's eye
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause the eyes of a creature you can see within range to lose acuity. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and all attack rolls for the duration of the spell. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This spell has no effect on a creature that is blind or that doesn't use its eyes to see.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
