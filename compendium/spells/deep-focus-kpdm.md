# Deep Focus
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Special

You tap into ambient magical energy to stabilize and maintain a spell. The next spell you cast that normally requires concentration will last its full normal duration without the need for concentration, as long as it is cast within 1 minute of your casting of this spell, and the spell to be affected is of 4th level or lower. At the end of the duration, or if 1 minute goes by without your casting a spell that requires concentration, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect any spell you can cast that requires concentration and is up to one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast deep focus.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
