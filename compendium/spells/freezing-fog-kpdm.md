# Freezing Fog
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 minute

The spell creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of mist similar to a [fog cloud](compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) spell centered on a point you can see within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and the area it occupies is heavily obscured. A wind of moderate or greater velocity (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round. The fog is freezing cold; any creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage and gains one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and no [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
