# Lesser Charm
*cantrip, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. The targeted creature makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid is [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you until the spell's duration expires, until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it, or until it performs a minor favor for you. The [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance or distant kin. It is willing to reveal a secret, open a door, lift an object, share food or water, or perform another favor on a similar level. It won't fight on your behalf, defend you in combat, put its life or property at risk, or threaten or harm someone else it considers a friend. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you.
