# Crushing Curse
*cantrip, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of Void Speech. Choose a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage and be [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute, except that it can still hear Void Speech. A creature [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

This spell's damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`)), 11th level (`dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`)).

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
