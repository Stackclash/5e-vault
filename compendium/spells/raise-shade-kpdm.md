*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell is identical to [raise ghost](compendium/spells/raise-ghost-kpdm.md) in every way, except the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it's not sufficient to wield one in combat, or to draw a bow.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock)
