# Fluctuating Alignment
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You channel the force of chaos to taint your target's mind. A target that gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw must roll `dice:1d20|noform|avg` (``) and consult the Alignment Fluctuation table to find its new alignment, and it must roll again after every minute of the spell's duration. The target's alignment stops fluctuating and returns to normal when the spell ends. These changes do not make the affected creature friendly or hostile toward the caster, but they can cause creatures to behave in unpredictable ways.
