# Hamund's Herbal Hypodermic
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minute

When you cast this spell, you grow a hollow needle from your arm for the duration that can be used as a natural finesse weapon to make unarmed strikes that deal `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) + Dexterity modifier in damage.

Strikes with this needle can also be used to quickly deliver a poison or herb that would normally take much longer to apply to a weapon. As a bonus action, you may use the needle to absorb a poison or herb that would normally be used to coat a weapon. If you do so, this needle acts as if it is coated in that poison or herb, with all the benefits that would entail.

**Classes**: [Artificer](list-spells-classes-artificer); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
