# Snap the Leash
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a used leash or similar object
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a beast that you can see within range. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. The beast must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, you remove the shackles of domestication from the creature's mind, causing it to entirely forget being broken or trained. Mounts refuse to be ridden, and other animals forget any tricks learned and obedience taught. Other memories are not affected, so creatures might remain drawn to those who have treated them kindly and aggressive toward those who have harmed them. The animal can be domesticated again, but the trainer must start from scratch.

This spell is only partly effective against animal companions, familiars, and paladin mounts. Although the spell removes any tricks such creatures know, the bond between creature and master is otherwise unaffected.
