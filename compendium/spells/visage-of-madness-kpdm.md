# Visage of Madness
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, your face momentarily becomes that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies mad. Every foe that's within 30 feet of you and that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature claws savagely at its eyes, dealing piercing damage to itself equal to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) + the creature's Strength modifier. The creature is also [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the end of its next turn and [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. A creature that rolls maximum damage against itself (a 6 on the `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`)) is [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) permanently.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight)
