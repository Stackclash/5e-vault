# Cloak of Serpents
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a snake scale
- **Duration:** 10 minute

A mass of writhing, translucent snakes drapes your body, protecting you from harm and fending off enemies. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

For the duration of the spell, you gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, that creature is struck by one of the serpents. The attacker takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) effect.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock)
