# Lower the Veil
*8th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a strip of thin gauze or other sheer material
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly drop the veil of reality for selected targets, allowing a brief glimpse into the deep nothing beyond this realm to shatter their minds. Each creature you choose within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:8d10|noform|avg` (`8d10`) psychic damage and be driven insane for 10 minutes, per the [symbol](compendium/spells/symbol.md) spell. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half the damage and is [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round. Creatures already suffering from insanity are immune to this spell. Blindness, however, is not a defense, since the experience is not sight-based, but an internal awareness.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
