# Ears of the Bat
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a bit of bat fur
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You gain the keen hearing and echolocation abilities of a bat. For the duration of the spell, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing, and you gain [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) out to a range of 60 feet.

You cannot use the [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) ability while [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened). While the spell is in effect, you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal thunder damage.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock)
