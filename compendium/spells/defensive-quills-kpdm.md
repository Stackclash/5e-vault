# Defensive Quills
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a porcupine's quill
- **Duration:** 10 minute

Sharp quills grow from your skin. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. You gain a +1 bonus to AC for the duration. If a creature hits you with an attack made by a light weapon, a natural attack, or an unarmed strike, it takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) piercing damage from your quills. A creature that grapples you takes damage from the quills at the beginning of each of its turns in which it is grappling you. If a creature swallows you, it takes damage from the quills each round at the start of your turn.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
