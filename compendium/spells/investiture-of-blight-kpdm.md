# Investiture of Blight
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a vial of ectoplasm or ghostly essence
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Ghostly spirits emerge from your body and whirl around you. Your body emits dim light in a 15-foot radius for the spell's duration. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You have immunity to necrotic damage and resistance to poison damage.  
- Creatures that miss on melee attacks against you become [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you until the end of their next turn.  
- You can use an action to direct the ghostly spirits to assail a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) necrotic damage and gain one level of [exhaustion](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).
