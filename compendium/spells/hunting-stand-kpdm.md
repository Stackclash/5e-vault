# Hunting Stand
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a crude model of the stand
- **Duration:** 8 hour

You make a camouflaged shelter nestled in the branches of a tree or among a collection of stones. The shelter is a 10-foot cube centered on a point within range. It can hold as many as nine Medium or smaller creatures. The atmosphere inside the shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. The shelter's camouflage provides a modicum of concealment to its inhabitants; a creature outside the shelter has disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) and Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks to detect or locate a creature within the shelter.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
