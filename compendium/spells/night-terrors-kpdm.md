# Night Terrors
*4th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a crow's eye
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You amplify the fear that lurks in the heart of all creatures. Select a target point you can see within the spell's range. Every creature within 20 feet of that point becomes [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) until the start of your next turn and must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed). A [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures immune to being [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) are not affected by this spell.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
