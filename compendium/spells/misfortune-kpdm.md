# Misfortune
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a broken mirror
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cast a pall of bad luck over all creatures in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed with bad luck for the duration of the spell. A creature under the effect of this spell has disadvantage on all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. A [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell ends this effect.

**SPECIAL:** If a targeted creature is carrying a [stone of good luck](compendium/items/stone-of-good-luck.md), the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the item ceases to function for 24 hours. Likewise, if a targeted creature is carrying a [luck blade](compendium/items/luck-blade.md), the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the sword's Luck ability and saving throw bonuses cease to function for 24 hours.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
