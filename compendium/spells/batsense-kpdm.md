# Batsense
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a bit of fur from a bat's ear
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration of the spell, a creature you touch can produce and interpret squeaking sounds used for echolocation, giving it [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) out to a range of 60 feet. The target cannot use its [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) while [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), and its [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight) doesn't penetrate areas of magical silence. While using [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight), the target has disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks that rely on being silent. Additionally, the target has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer)
