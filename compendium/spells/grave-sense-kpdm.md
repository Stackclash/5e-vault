# Grave Sense
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a willing undead creature or one that's under your control. For the duration of the spell, you can use an action to see what the undead creature sees (including through [darkvision](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision), [blindsight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Blindsight), tremorsense, or [truesight](/compendium/rules/senses.md#Truesight)), and to hear what it hears, until the start of your next turn. You use your own ability scores and skill proficiencies to spot things and to interpret the sensations you're receiving.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster)
