    \ (spell save DC 14, dice: d20+6 (+6 to hit) with spell attacks). He has the\

- "desc": "The knight regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the knight\
    \ takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the\
    \ knight's next turn. The knight's body is destroyed only if it starts its turn\
    \ with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate."
  "name": "Regeneration"
- "desc": "When the knight's body is destroyed, its soul lingers. After 24 hours,\
    \ the soul inhabits and animates another humanoid corpse on the same plane of\
    \ existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul is bodiless, a wish\
    \ spell can be used to force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return."
  "name": "Rejuvenation"
- "desc": "The knight is immune to effects that turn undead."
  "name": "Turn Immunity"
- "desc": "The knight knows the distance to and direction of any creature against\

    \ planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the knight dies, the knight\
    \ knows."

"actions":
- "desc": "The knight makes two longsword attacks or two fist attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: dice: d20+7 (+7 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target.\

    \ dice: 4d6|avg (4d6) slashing damage."

- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: dice: d20+7 (+7 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target.\
    \ Hit: dice: 2d6 + 4|avg (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is\
    \ a creature against which the knight has sworn vengeance, the target takes an\
    \ extra dice: 4d6|avg (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage,\
    \ the knight can grapple the target (escape DC 14) provided the target is Large\
    \ or smaller."
  "name": "Fist"
- "desc": "The knight targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it and against\
    \ which it has sworn vengeance. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.\
    \ On a failure, the target is paralyzed until the knight deals damage to it, or\
    \ until the end of the knight's next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target\
    \ is frightened of the knight for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the\
    \ saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see\
    \ the knight, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success."
