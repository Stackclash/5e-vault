The Mad Oracle, the Madness-flesh, Uursovk may once have been a king or queen of Chaos itself. No one remembers that far back. Rumors are easy to come by, tales of things older than the Thrones themselves. Things of pure changing power, with no minds, no will except to remake the universe in their own terrible fluctuating imageless images.

Uursovk is the only member of the Court who is vulnerable to shapechanging magics, lacking sufficient will to prevent it.

Any image of Uursovk is by definition a facile rendering by lesser minds. Gazing upon the Mindwiper, one sees organs and limbs twisting and reshaping. Often one feels one is seeing many sides of the same beast at the same time, or an amalgam of many different creatures each superimposed over the others. But this is no imageâ€”their limbs meld into each other, twisting in torturous ways. Often the various appendages shudder, as though the creatures who once had these body parts are suffering incredible agony.

The smell itself is enough to choke someone, a rotting abattoir of putrid maggoty meat.

Uursovk is also known as the Oracle of the Court of All Flesh, occasionally making prophetic pronouncements that often come true. Uursovk's madness in no way impairs his second sight.

## Tactics

The Madness-flesh broadcasts an Insanity Field that interferes with conscious thought, causing nausea in intelligent creatures. Because its DC is based on Intelligence, maybe don't drop this guy next to the enemy magic-user. Fighters and rogues are more likely to fail their saves.

Just the sight of Uursovk ignites its Madness Aura, which blocks enemies' minds from being able to formulate the thoughts required to cast spells. This is a passive ability, though, so you don't have to burn an action to do it.

Uursovk's epic closer is Meld Flesh, which literally melts two adjacent enemies into one gestalt. Not as radical as it sounds, the gestalt creature can do anything the original two creatures could do, but it only gets one turn. This one prompts a Constitution saving throw, so it's a good option for hitting magic-users and glass cannons.
