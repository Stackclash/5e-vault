The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 3. Fear Ray.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 4. Slowing Ray.

In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking dice: 8d8|avg (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- 6. Telekinetic Ray.

The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.  \n- 7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious|unconscious]] for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n- 8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained|restrained]]. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#petrified|petrified]] until freed by the  [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md|greater restoration]] spell or other magic.  \n- 9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take dice: 10d8|avg (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- 10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take dice: 10d10|avg (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  ",
