The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 3. Fear Ray.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 4. Slowing Ray.

In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking dice: 8d8|avg (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- 6. Telekinetic Ray.

The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.  \n- 7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious|unconscious]] for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n- 8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained|restrained]]. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#petrified|petrified]] until freed by the  [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md|greater restoration]] spell or other magic.  \n- 9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take dice: 10d8|avg (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- 10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take dice: 10d10|avg (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  ",

Mechanics/Items/Acid Vial.md|flask of acid]]. Ranged Weapon Attack: dice: d20+4 (+4 to hit), range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: dice: 2d6|avg (2d6) acid damage.  \n- 2 Alchemist's Fire. The kobold throws a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Fire Flask.md|flask of alchemist's fire]]. Ranged Weapon Attack: dice: d20+4 (+4 to hit), range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: dice: 1d4|avg (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target's turns. The target can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.  \n- 3 Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A [swarm of insects (centipedes)](compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-centipedes.md) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50% chance chance that the swarm disperses.  \n- 4 Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: dice: d20+4 (+4 to hit), range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: dice: 1d10|avg (1d10) acid damage, and the target is covered in slime until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the slime off. A target covered in the slime takes dice: 1d10|avg (1d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.  \n- 5 Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Rot Grubs (MPMM).md|swarm of rot grubs]] (in this book) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.  \n- 6 Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Scorpion.md|scorpion]] tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: dice: d20+4 (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking dice: 1d8|avg (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- 7 Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, or it retches and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated|incapacitated]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn't need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.  \n- 8 Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Wasps.md|swarm of insects (wasps)]] with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50% chance chance that the swarm disperses.  ",

The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed|charmed]] by the death tyrant for 1 hour, or until the death tyrant harms the creature.  \n- 2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened|frightened]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking dice: 8d8|avg (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- 6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained|restrained]] by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death tyrant is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated|incapacitated]].  \n\n    If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.  \n- 7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious|unconscious]] for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n- 8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained|restrained]]. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#petrified|petrified]] until freed by the  [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md|greater restoration]] spell or other magic.  \n- 9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take dice: 10d8|avg (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- 10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take dice: 10d10|avg (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  ",
