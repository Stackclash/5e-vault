## Strong Start  
As the echoes of Strahd's haunting past fade into the ether, you find yourselves still reeling from the revelations unveiled by the magical Tome of Strahd. But before you can fully process the weight of this knowledge, a sudden urgency grips the airâ€”a mysterious wounded woman, her desperate plea for aid punctuated by the howls of approaching werewolves.

With little hesitation, you find yourselves thrust into action once more, drawn into a fray not of your making but one that demands your courage nonetheless. As the moon casts its baleful light upon the forest, shadows dance ominously amidst the trees, heralding the arrival of the lupine menace that hunts its prey with ruthless abandon. Without knowing the full extent of the danger that surrounds you, you make a pact, a silent vow to stand united against the encroaching darkness, to defend this tower and its secrets from those who would seek to tear it asunder.

And so, as the first snarls of the werewolves echo through the night, you steel yourselves for battle, your resolve unyielding in the face of adversity. What horrors await you beyond the tower's threshold?
