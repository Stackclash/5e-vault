# Session
## Strong Start
Since you've arrived in this land you have been met with darkness in form of a malevolent mansion that seemed determined that you meet the same fate as its previous owners and visitors. You have seen the despair that fills the very air around you and permeates the habitants leaving them as nothing but empty husks. Despite all of this, as if in defiance of all that you've seen so far you set out from the desolate village of Barovia in the hopes of saving just one innocent woman from this evil place and the lord who is it's master.

## Loot, Rewards & Purchases
- [ ] [[Alchemy Jug]]
- [ ] [[Pipes Of Haunting]]

## Keep in Mind
- If the hags capture the party they cast [[Geas]] on the party and force them to deliver their hag eye to [[Cyrus Belview (COS)]]
