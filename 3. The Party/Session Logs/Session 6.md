## Session Prep:
Things I need to get ready before the session:
- [ ] Have Vallaki NPCs prepared
	- [ ] Pronunciation
	- [ ] Position and goals
- [ ] Figure out how to handle the following:
	- [ ] Festival of the Blazing Sun
	- [ ] Strahd's Attack (St. Andral's Feast)
	- [ ] Retrieving St. Andral's Bones
	- [ ] Dinner with [[Lady Fiona Wachter (COS)]] 
	- [ ] Dinner with [[Vargas Vallakovich]] 

## Plan
High story beats, main things I want to happen this session.
- The characters should meet the following people before everything goes down
	- [[Gadof Blinksy]] 
	- Rudolph van Richen aka Rictavio
- [ ] Dinner with [[Vargas Vallakovich]] 
	- [ ] Vargas invites the party to his house for dinner
	- [ ] He suggests that because Ireena is the adoptive daughter of the burgomaster of the town of Barovia that she should marry his son [[Victor Vallakovich]] 
- [ ] Festival of the Blazing Sun
	- [ ] Lars Kjurls - guard is the one who laughs
	- [ ] If the characters challenge Vargas he has the guards arrest them and lock them up
	- [ ] After a while Vargas comes and talks to them asking them to not get in the way and releases them if they are cooperative
- [ ] Dinner with [[Lady Fiona Wachter (COS)]] 
	- [ ] Ernst Larnak begins shadowing the characters (detected if passive perception is 14 or higher)
	- [ ] 
- [ ] Retrieving St. Andral's Bones
- [ ] [[Strahd von Zarovich]] 's Attack (St. Andral's Feast)
