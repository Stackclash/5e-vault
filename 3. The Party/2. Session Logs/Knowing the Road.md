# Session
## Strong Start
Since you've arrived in this land you have been met with darkness in form of a malevolent mansion that seemed determined that you meet the same fate as its previous owners and visitors. You have seen the despair that fills the very air around you and permeates the habitants leaving them as nothing but empty husks. Despite all of this, as if in defiance of all that you've seen so far you set out from the desolate village of Barovia in the hopes of saving just one innocent woman from this evil place and the lord who is it's master.

## Loot, Rewards & Purchases
- [ ] [[Alchemy Jug]]
- [ ] [[Pipes Of Haunting]]

## Keep in Mind
- If the hags capture the party they cast [[Geas]] on the party and force them to deliver their hag eye to [[Cyrus Belview (COS)]] 
- [Dream Pastry](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/r1-q3tL4LH)
- [[Marin|Marin's]] patron is a fiend whose domain is torture. When [[Marin]] uses her magic her skin begins to crack and fingernails begin to grow longer 

## Events

### Card Reading
This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.
Look for a wizard's tower on a lake. Let the wizard's name and servant guide you to that which you seek.

This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.
I see a dead village, drowned by a river, ruled by one who has brought great evil into the world.

This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.
What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors.

This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.
Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems.

Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!
He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all.
