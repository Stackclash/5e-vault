summary: The party attends the Festival of the Blazing Sun and when it ultimately falls apart a guard laughs at the misfortune. The Baron has him arrested. Yevelda stands up for the guard and is arrested as well. During a sermon given by Father Lucian, the bones of St. Andral are secretly stolen and Strahd shows up with a hoard of vampire spawn and starts killing everyone. Faerah is able to intercept the bones and return them casting Strahd and his hoard out of the church.

## Session Prep:
Things I need to get ready before the session:
- [ ] Eludrax is the name of the wizard that created mechanical men
	- Blinksy wants to see this mechanical man
- [ ] Strahd's speech when he appears
	- Despair. You know of all the songs the human emotions sing, I believe that despair is my favorite. It's not the weeping over a loved one nor mere sadness. It is a gnawing, clawing void that drifts at the edge of consciousness forever threatening to eat us from the inside out. To see that void get in to hear that melody play on a man's heart, there is nothing sweeter to my ears. So tell me dear people of Vallaki, my little birds, are you going to sing me a song?
