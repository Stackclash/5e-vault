## Notes
- Currently in [[Castle Ravenloft]] dungeon:
	- [[Ezmerelda Davenir (COS)]]
	- [[Izek Strazni (COS)]]

- Introductions at the Gates
	- - **Redgrave, the Warforged Cleric**:  
	    _"Behold, Redgrave, the construct of faith—one who seeks to save souls while having none of his own. A shining beacon of devotion, if only he had a heart to feel it."_
    
	- **Faerah Duskrane, the Drow Rogue**:  
	    _"Faerah Duskrane, the drow shadow that moves within shadows. Perhaps she misses her home in the Underdark."_
	    
	- **Marin, the Half-Elf Warlock**:  
	    _"And here we have Marin, torn between two worlds and two souls. A pawn of greater powers, forever seeking what lies beyond, yet never satisfied with what she finds."_
	    
	- **Seluvis Felo'melorn, the High Elf Artificer**:  
	    _"Seluvis Felo'melorn, the brilliant artificer. So much knowledge in such a refined mind, yet always tinkering—perhaps in hopes of fixing that which cannot be mended."_
	    
	- **Yevelda Ovak, the Human Barbarian**:  
	    _"Yevelda Ovak, raw strength in human form, ever charging forward. But does she break chains, or simply wear new ones forged by her own hands?"_
