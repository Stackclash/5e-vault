## Scenes  
- Argynvost's shadow appears to the players in shadow form and says, " Show them the light they have lost! Light the high tower’s beacon and let the ideals of the Order shine upon Barovia once again!" The shadow disappears—but not before painting a vivid scene upon the wall, all outlined in silvery light. You see a wicked castle that can be nothing but Castle Ravenloft. In the dungeons deep below lie the silvery bones of what can only be a dragon… and amidst them, a gemlike heart.
