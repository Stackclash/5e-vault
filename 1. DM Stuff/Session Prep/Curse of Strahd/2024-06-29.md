## Strong Start  
Last session, you faced critical choices and ventured into unknown territories. Weighing the ruins of Berez for a potential artifact from Madam Eva’s reading, you ultimately decided to press onward to Mount Ghakis in search of the elusive Fiend's Chili, crucial for curing Seluvis's lycanthropy. After a determined trek, you crossed the Luna River and arrived at the base of Mount Ghakis, only to be disturbed during the night by the ominous creaking of wood. Investigating, you discovered a mysterious tree bearing an ancient house in its branches and soon met the sinister Baba Lysaga.

When you mentioned your impending dinner with Strahd, she offered to teleport you directly to his castle. Although wary, you accepted her hospitality, except for Yevelda, whose insolence led Baba Lysaga to transform her into a goat. Quick thinking by Redgrave averted disaster, convincing the witch to revert Yevelda. Capitalizing on the moment, you retreated up Mount Ghakis, enduring a grueling climb to find the Fiend’s Chili at the peak. Seluvis crafted the potion, curing his lycanthropy, but your discovery of a massive, foreboding temple carved into the mountain hinted at even greater mysteries and dangers ahead. The temple’s dark presence looms, promising both peril and potential as your journey continues.
