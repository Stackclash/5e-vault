## Strong Start  
Amidst the shattered ruins of Khazan's tower, the party stands victorious yet weary after repelling Kiril's werewolf ambush. The once-sturdy walls now bear scars from the relentless assault, but the group's courage held firm against the lycanthropic onslaught. Despite Ezmerelda's wagon exploding and the roof nearly collapsing, their resolve prevailed. Kiril, the werewolf leader, met his end at the hands of the barbarian, a testament to their determination. But victory is bittersweet; the cost of battle weighs heavy as they gather amidst the wreckage. In the darkness that looms over Barovia, new perils await, and the adventurers must steel themselves for the trials ahead.
