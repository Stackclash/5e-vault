## Strong Start  
After brushing death in an evil infused temple and narrowly escaping being a meal for a giant bird you all take a moment to enjoy the slow descent down from the mountain. You feel the cool air rushing past gradually grow warmed and you watch the jagged sides of the mountain fly past sometimes spotting a group of birds making a perch on a tree growing out of the mountain side. You all land on the water below you, a little choppy, but you are able to keep your footing. As this moment of tranquility passes you remember the haunted land you are still in and that you only have one more artifact to find to be ready to finally bring the fight to Strahd.
