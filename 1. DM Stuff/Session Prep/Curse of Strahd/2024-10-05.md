## Strong Start  
Last session, your careful planning and execution led to a daring raid on Baba Lysaga’s treetop lair. With Redgrave’s silence spell suppressing the magical alarms around the house, you managed to infiltrate the ancient structure unnoticed. Inside, you discovered the heart of the magical tree—a glowing green gem entangled in vines—and a mysterious, ghostly chest that remained untouchable by normal means. With quick thinking, the party used the bag of holding to scoop up the chest and forcibly removed the gem from its binding, making a swift escape before Baba Lysaga could react.

Retreating north to the safety of your newly claimed wizard's tower, you found it in ruins, its structure cracked and crumbling. Upon one of the shattered stones lay a chilling message: an invitation to Strahd's wedding with Ireena, revealing that she had been taken by Strahd during your absence and Izek is no where to be seen. The weight of this revelation presses upon you all as the fate of your companion now hangs in the balance.
