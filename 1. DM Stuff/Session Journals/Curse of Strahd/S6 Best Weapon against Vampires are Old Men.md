## Session Prep:
Things I need to get ready before the session:
- [ ] Have Vallaki NPCs prepared
	- [ ] Pronunciation
	- [ ] Position and goals
- [x] Figure out how to handle the following:
	- [x] Festival of the Blazing Sun
	- [x] Strahd's Attack (St. Andral's Feast)
	- [x] Retrieving St. Andral's Bones
	- [x] Dinner with [[Lady Fiona Wachter (COS)]] 
	- [x] Dinner with [[Vargas Vallakovich]] 

## Plan
High story beats, main things I want to happen this session.
- The characters should meet the following people before everything goes down
	- [[Gadof Blinksy]] 
		- Have Father Lucian send the party to Blinksy's to get a toy for Yeska (Lucian's young assistant)
	- Rudolph van Richen aka Rictavio
		- Have Nikolai and Karl Wachter bother Rictavio to urge the party to intervene and meet him
- [ ] Dinner with [[Vargas Vallakovich]] 
	- [ ] Vargas invites the party to his house for dinner
	- [ ] He suggests that because Ireena is the adoptive daughter of the burgomaster of the town of Barovia that she should marry his son [[Victor Vallakovich]] 
- [ ] Festival of the Blazing Sun
	- [ ] Lars Kjurls - guard is the one who laughs
	- [ ] If the characters challenge Vargas he has the guards arrest them and lock them up
	- [ ] After a while Vargas comes and talks to them asking them to not get in the way and releases them if they are cooperative
- [ ] Dinner with [[Lady Fiona Wachter (COS)]] 
	- [ ] Ernst Larnak begins shadowing the characters (detected if passive perception is 14 or higher)
	- [ ] If the characters show that they may not support what is happening in Vallaki or they say something at the festival they are invited to dinner
		- [ ] If they refuse the Wachter seeks to destroy them by giving the Vistani camp outside money to kill the party
	- [ ] During the dinner Fiona is called away for a bit possibly allowing the party to explore
- [ ] Retrieving St. Andral's Bones
	- [ ] Milivoj took the bones to . He can be convinced to tell where he brought them to Henrik van der Voort (coffin maker) for money to feed his younger sisters and brothers
	- [ ] Henrik refuses to tell where the bones are unless force is used. During the day he'll retrieve them, but during the night he doesn't dare retrieve them.
	- [ ] If guards are called he confesses that the vampire spawn forced him to steal the bones
- [ ] [[Strahd von Zarovich]] 's Attack (St. Andral's Feast)
	- [ ] If the bones are retrieved
		- [ ] Strahd brings out Father Lucian telling everyone how he lied to his congregation
	- [ ] If the bones are not retrieved 
		- [ ] Strahd tells everyone how the burgomaster has tried to hide behind his festivals and giving everyone lies
	- [ ] Strahd invites Ireena with him, saying that all humans are liers and killers.
	- [ ] Strahd tells Ireena that next time he'll be forced to take her by force
