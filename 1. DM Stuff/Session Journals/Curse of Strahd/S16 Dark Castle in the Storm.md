  As the rain began to pour and the party caught sight of a looming castle in the distance, they pressed onward, eventually arriving at Argynvostholt. The ancient castle stood shrouded in mist and mystery, beckoning them to explore its darkened halls.

  Inside, Redgrave's mind was haunted by fragmented memories of a past life—a life spent as a member of the Order of the Silver Dragon, now fleeting and elusive.

  Their exploration led them to Savid, a troubled soul searching for a missing Vistani girl and hiding from the relentless undead that plagued Argynvostholt's halls.

  Guided by the ethereal presence of Argynvost, manifesting as a spectral fire in the form of a dragon, the party received a solemn plea: to redeem the fallen knights of the Order and relight the beacon atop the high tower, restoring the Order's noble ideals to Barovia.

  Discovering the mournful revenants known as the Mournful Three, the party faced a tense confrontation. Through Redgrave's earnest diplomacy, they managed to convince one of the revenants that they sought peace, easing the immediate tension.

  Their path then led them to Vladimir Horngaard, another revenant who guarded the castle. Vladimir sternly informed them of Strahd Von Zarovich's unending suffering, implying a deeper understanding of the curse that bound Barovia.

  To earn passage and gain Vladimir's trust, the party agreed to undergo a trial. They boldly walked through a wall of fire, demonstrating their resolve and commitment to their mission in the land tormented by darkness.
