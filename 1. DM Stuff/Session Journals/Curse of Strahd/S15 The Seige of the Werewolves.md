summary: |-
  As the night fell and tension mounted, the party fortified their tower, fashioning makeshift bear traps from furniture and meticulously coating half of them with wolfsbane—a crucial deterrent against the approaching werewolves. In the eerie stillness, the first signs of the impending assault manifested as werewolves launched their attack.

  Some werewolves scaled the tower walls, seeking entry from above, while others relentlessly pounded on the front door, using Ezmerelda Davenir's wagon as a makeshift battering ram. In a desperate move, Seluvis Felo'melorn detonated the wagon, causing havoc among the werewolves gathered there and buying the defenders precious moments.

  Despite their efforts, the werewolves eventually breached the front door, pouring into the tower with ferocity. Seluvis, Faerah Duskrane, and Izek Strazni held their ground on the top floor, engaging werewolves descending from the ceiling in a fierce battle to protect their position. Tragically, amidst the chaos, Seluvis was bitten by a werewolf, and despite Redgrave's immediate attempt to use Remove Curse, the curse of lycanthropy persisted.

  Realizing the gravity of Seluvis's condition, the party understood that a more complex cure was necessary—combining wolfsbane, the heart of the werewolf that bit him, and the elusive Fiends Chilli. This rare ingredient could be found on the slopes of Mt. Ghakis, knowledge possessed by Ezmerelda Davenir.

  In the midst of the skirmish, Yevelda Ovak delivered a decisive blow, dealing the killing strike to Kiril Stoyanovich, the leader of the assaulting werewolves. With this victory came a brief respite, but the looming challenge of curing Seluvis and fortifying against future threats weighed heavily on the party's minds as the night wore on.
