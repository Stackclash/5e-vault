summary: |-
  The party, undeterred by the malevolent aura that brought them to their knees, pressed on into the foreboding depths of the Amber Temple. Marin, inexplicably unaffected, led the way into the darkness that pervaded the empty, ruined halls. A towering statue of a dark magic caster stood sentinel, its face obscured by impenetrable magical darkness.

  Their exploration led them to encounter two wildling men and a fierce woman atop a dire wolf, consumed by rage and driven to attack. In a moment of clarity, the woman recognized Yevelda as Helga before the conflict escalated. The party subdued the men, incapacitated the woman—Karina—and learned of others at Yester Hill, earning the friendship of the dire wolf amid their grim surroundings.

  Their brief respite was shattered when a seizure gripped the entire party, draining their life force until only Marin remained unaffected. As they struggled against this supernatural assault, realizing the depth of the temple's evil, they attempted to escape, only to find the exit had vanished. Forced to delve deeper, they confronted the source of the malevolence—an imprisoned lich encased in amber, suspended above an arcane mechanism.

  Witnessing Karina's soul being consumed by the lich through a portal above the amber, the party confronted the grim reality of the temple's horrors.
