summary: |-
  The party attended the much-anticipated Festival of the Blazing Sun, a cornerstone of Baron Vargas's attempts to foster cheer and defiance against Strahd. However, as the festival unfolded, a torrential downpour thwarted the Baron's plans, rendering the grand bonfire unlit. Amid the chaos, a guard's ill-timed laughter at the Baron's misfortune led to his immediate arrest. Yevelda, ever the stalwart protector of justice, stood up for the guard and found herself arrested as well, further straining relations with the Baron.

  As tensions simmered, the congregation gathered for a sermon by Father Lucian. Unbeknownst to them, the sacred bones of St. Andral were once again stolen. Seizing the moment of vulnerability, Strahd himself appeared at the church's doorstep, leading a horde of vampire spawn in a brutal assault on the unsuspecting villagers. Chaos erupted as Strahd and his minions wreaked havoc. In a desperate bid to save the town, Faerah intercepted the stolen bones, bravely returning them to their rightful place. The relics' restored power surged through the church, casting Strahd and his dark brood out and granting the beleaguered townsfolk a brief but crucial reprieve from the vampire lord's wrath.

## Session Prep:
Things I need to get ready before the session:
- [ ] Eludrax is the name of the wizard that created mechanical men
	- Blinksy wants to see this mechanical man
- [ ] Strahd's speech when he appears
	- Despair. You know of all the songs the human emotions sing, I believe that despair is my favorite. It's not the weeping over a loved one nor mere sadness. It is a gnawing, clawing void that drifts at the edge of consciousness forever threatening to eat us from the inside out. To see that void get in to hear that melody play on a man's heart, there is nothing sweeter to my ears. So tell me dear people of Vallaki, my little birds, are you going to sing me a song?
