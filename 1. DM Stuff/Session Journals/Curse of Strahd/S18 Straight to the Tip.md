summary: |-
  The party deliberated on whether to stay in the ruins of Berez, contemplating the possibility that it might hold an artifact Madam Eva had mentioned in her reading. Ultimately, they decided to continue to Mount Ghakis to find the Fiend's Chili, essential for curing Seluvis's lycanthropy.

  After crossing the Luna River, they arrived at the foot of Mount Ghakis. During the night, they heard a loud creaking of wood. Investigating the noise, they discovered a large tree that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, with an old house nestled in its branches. They were soon visited by Baba Lysaga, an old witch. When the party informed her that Strahd was expecting them for dinner, she offered to feed them and teleport them directly to his castle.

  Despite their hesitance, the party accepted her hospitalityâ€”everyone except Yevelda, who insulted Baba Lysaga with her attitude. In response, Baba Lysaga transformed Yevelda into a goat. Redgrave quickly reassured Baba Lysaga with a lie, saying that Strahd would be insulted if Yevelda wasn't with them and that they needed to collect their things before going through the portal. Convinced, Baba Lysaga reverted Yevelda back to her original form.

  Seizing the opportunity, the party quickly retreated up Mount Ghakis. After a challenging climb, they arrived at the peak and found a Fiend's Chili. Seluvis successfully created the potion and cured his lycanthropy. In the midst of their search for the chili, they stumbled upon a massive, ominous temple carved into the side of the mountain, its presence foreboding and mysterious.
