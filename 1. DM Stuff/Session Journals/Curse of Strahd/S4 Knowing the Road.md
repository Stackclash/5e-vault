### Madam Eva's Reading
This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.
Look for a wizard's tower on a lake. Let the wizard's name and servant guide you to that which you seek.

This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.
I see a dead village, drowned by a river, ruled by one who has brought great evil into the world.

This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.
What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors.

This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.
Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems.

Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!
He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all.
