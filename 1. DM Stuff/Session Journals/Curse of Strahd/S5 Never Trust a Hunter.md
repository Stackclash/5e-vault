summary: |-
  On their arduous journey to Vallaki, the party encountered a hunter named Stefan, who kindly offered to guide them the rest of the way. However, this act of goodwill quickly turned treacherous when Stefan revealed his true nature as a werewolf, signaling a pack to ambush the unsuspecting adventurers. A fierce battle ensued, with the party fighting valiantly and slaying several of the ferocious beasts, including the deceptive Stefan. They managed to capture and bind one remaining werewolf to a tree, leaving a grim reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of Barovia.

  Arriving in Vallaki, the party escorted Ireena to the sanctuary of St. Andral's Church, where they were warmly greeted by Father Lucian. Amidst their respite, Father Lucian confided in the adventurers, revealing a grave misfortune: the sacred bones of St. Andral had been stolen from the crypt beneath the church. These holy relics had protected the church from the pervasive evil of Barovia, and their absence left the sanctuary vulnerable. With this new quest laid before them, the party now faces the daunting task of recovering the stolen bones to restore the church's protective power, even as the dark influence of Strahd looms ever closer.
