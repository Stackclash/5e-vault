summary: |-
  Redgrave discovered the diary of Godfrey Gwilym, a significant find as it unveiled the identity of the man he used to be. Meanwhile, the party faced a somber moment upon learning that Savid had been killed by a ghost during their absence. To uncover the circumstances of his death, Marin cast Speak With Dead on Savid and asked several questions. They learned that a ghost had killed him while he was searching for a lost Vistani girl. Savid also revealed that the Vistani could leave Barovia due to a special ability granted by Strahd and mentioned a legend about a dark power imprisoning Strahd in Barovia.

  The party debated whether to bring Savid's remains with them in their Bag of Holding and ultimately decided to take him along. Their exploration continued as they found Redgrave's, or rather Godfrey Gwilym's, grave. Marin dug up the grave and found a silver dragon made from silver wire. Upon touching the silver dragon, Redgrave experienced a vivid flashback of a close friend named Emeric. The vision revealed that Emeric had left to investigate a danger, which turned out to be Eludrax, the being responsible for Redgrave's creation. Godfrey had followed his friend, leading to an eventual battle with Eludrax.

  Their journey took a tense turn when Strahd intercepted the party, grappling Seluvis and threatening to kill him while demanding to know Ireena Kolyana's whereabouts. The party managed to feign ignorance regarding Ireena's location, avoiding immediate conflict with Strahd.

  Continuing south, they arrived in the ruined town of Berez. Here, they encountered the ghosts of long-dead villagers who seemed oblivious to the living. The party met the Burgomaster Ulrich, the only one aware of their presence. Ulrich warned them of the dangers in Berez, particularly cautioning them about a witch who resided there.
