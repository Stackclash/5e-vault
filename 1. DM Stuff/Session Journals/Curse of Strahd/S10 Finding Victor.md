  In their pursuit of Victor Vallakovich, the party uncovered evidence suggesting he had utilized a teleportation sigil to visit Gertruda. Following this lead, they activated the teleportation circle, intending to reach the Village of Barovia. Conversations with Mad Mary and Ismark Kolyanovich there confirmed Gertruda's disappearance, deepening their resolve to find her.

  Attempting to return to Vallaki via the teleportation circle, they unexpectedly found themselves transported to the dreaded Castle Ravenloft, Strahd's imposing fortress. Inside, they unexpectedly encountered Victor Vallakovich, adding an unexpected twist to their quest. Determined to understand the intricacies of the teleportation system, the party deciphered its workings and successfully redirected it, finally arriving at the Coffin Maker's Shop in Vallaki.

  Now reunited with Victor and poised to confront the mysteries surrounding Gertruda's disappearance and the deeper secrets of Barovia, the adventurers must navigate the perilous paths ahead, knowing that Castle Ravenloft looms ominously in the backdrop of their adventures.

# Session
## Start
Weary from restoring order within the church, you found the town marinating in silent fury. The Baron's residence, an ominous silhouette against the night, stood silent and guarded, its once-vocal occupants mysteriously absent from the aftermath of the chaos that ensued.
Anger simmered beneath the surface, whispered grievances and furious murmurs building a tempest of resentment. In the cold light of morning, a transformed village revealed itself. A makeshift gallows stood defiantly in the square, a grim testament to the pent-up rage within every soul. Fiona Watcher, a spectral puppeteer orchestrating chaos, reveled in the twisted dance of the mob.
As the march of the accused began, Baron Vargas Vallakovich and his wife stood condemned before accusing eyes. The mob hungered for justice, or perhaps just an outlet for their suffering.
In the eleventh hour, you emerged like beacons from the shadows, confronting the madness. The air crackled with tension as you fiercely interceded to prevent the execution of Baron Vargas Vallakovich and his wife. With divine radiance you show the villagers a better way. Though the anger, pain, and misery still boils beneath the surface they amenable for the time being, trusting in the town's saviors. Amidst the chaos, a chilling realization took hold: Victor Vallakovich, the Baron's son, is nowhere to be found.
