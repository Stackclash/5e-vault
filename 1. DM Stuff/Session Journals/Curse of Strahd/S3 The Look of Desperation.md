summary: |-
  In a dramatic showdown within the Death House, the party clashed with the vengeful ghosts of Carl and Elisabeth, the previous owners, amidst a room filled with poisonous smoke. Yevelda Ovak found herself possessed by Elisabeth, but Redgrave's divine power expelled the spirit, sending Elisabeth fleeing. Desperation set in as the walls seemed to close in, leading Yevelda to break through a bricked-up window. Amidst the chaos, Carl effectively kills Marin, but Seluvis Felo'melorn and Yevelda managed to escape with her lifeless body through the shattered window. Marin's consciousness drifting through a lightless void hears whispers, promising renewed life if she accepts the entity's power. Shortly after Marin is revived, but somehow forever changed. As the party fled, Carl's enraged screeches echoed behind them as the window mysteriously healed and sealed up.

  Seeking respite, they made their way to a local store where Marin purchased a dagger, then found refuge in a tavern. While Marin rested, Ismark Kolyanovich approached Redgrave and Faerah Duskrane with a plea for help in escorting his sister, Ireena Kolyana, to Vallaki. The party gathered and ventured to the Burgomasterâ€™s mansion, where Ireena revealed her dire situation: Strahd Von Zarovich sought her and had already bitten her twice. However, she insisted on burying her adoptive father before leaving. At the church, the party met the distraught Father Donovich and heard unsettling screams from the basement, which Donovich nervously attributed to his son. Though the burial was set for sundown, the party's urgency convinced Ireena to depart early, setting the stage for their perilous journey to Vallaki.
