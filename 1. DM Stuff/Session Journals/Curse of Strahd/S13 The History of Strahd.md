summary: |-
  As the party delved into the Tome of Strahd, they were transported into a vivid memory of Castle Ravenloft's courtyard, witnessing a young Strahd von Zarovich training with Rahadin, his chamberlain. They conversed with the young Strahd, learning of his impending sibling's birth and the pressures he felt as heir to the Zarovich legacy.

  Returning abruptly to the tower, they discovered a magical wand and a chest containing a preserved severed head named Yan, a Vistani killed by Rictavio. Marin, intrigued by whispered promises, used the power offered to communicate with Yan, unraveling details of his tragic fate.

  Decoding the Tome's second chapter, they found themselves thrust into a battle in Strahd's name against the village of Zmei, defended by members of the Order of the Silver Dragon. This encounter stirred memories in Redgrave, hinting at his possible affiliation with this noble order.

  Outside the Tome once more, Redgrave experimented with the wand's abilities, discovering its power to repair and control the tower itself. Amidst their exploration, they were interrupted by Ezmerelda, a fierce monster hunter seeking her mentor, Rudolph van Richten. Tensions eased as introductions were made, and the party realized they had gained a powerful ally in their quest against Strahd. Together, they prepared to delve deeper into Barovia's secrets, armed with newfound knowledge and companionship.
