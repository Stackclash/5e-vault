summary: |-
  Flipping through the Tome of Strahd, the party was unexpectedly drawn into a vivid memory set within the serene castle courtyard of Castle Ravenloft. There, they encountered a young Strahd von Zarovich engaged in wooden swordplay with Rahadin, the stern chamberlain. They learned of Strahd's familial pressures and upcoming sibling, gaining insight into the early years of the dark lord's life.

  Returning to the tower, they found a newly appeared magical wand and a chest containing the preserved head of Yan, a Vistani who met his end at the hands of the traveler Rictavio. Marin, guided by mysterious whispers, accepted the power to communicate with Yan, unveiling details of his tragic demise and his identity.

  Decoding the Tome's second chapter, the party found themselves thrust into a harrowing battle for Strahd against the village of Zmei, defended by stalwart members of the Order of the Silver Dragon. This conflict stirred buried memories in Redgrave, suggesting a possible connection to this noble order.

  Back in the tower, Redgrave experimented with the wand's surprising ability to manipulate and repair the structure itself. Their explorations were interrupted by Ezmerelda, a fierce monster hunter seeking her mentor, Rudolph van Richten. Tensions escalated when Kiril Stoyanovich, leader of werewolves, arrived, demanding Ezmerelda's surrender after a failed assassination attempt on Strahd. The party stood firm, refusing to yield Ezmerelda to the werewolves, setting the stage for a tense standoff at the tower, with the outcome hanging in precarious balance.
