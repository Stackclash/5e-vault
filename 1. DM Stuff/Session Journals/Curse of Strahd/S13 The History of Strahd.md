summary: |-
  As the party delved into the Tome of Strahd, they were unexpectedly transported into a vivid memory of Castle Ravenloft's courtyard, witnessing a young Strahd von Zarovich in his formative years. They interacted with him during a training session with Rahadin, the Zarovich family chamberlain, where the young lord struggled under the weight of familial expectations and impending sibling rivalry.

  Returning to the tower, they discovered a magical wand on a desk that had mysteriously appeared, alongside a chest containing a preserved severed head. Marin, intrigued by whispers promising knowledge, accepted the ability to communicate with the head, revealing it belonged to Yan, a Vistani slain by a traveler named Rictavio.

  Deciphering the second chapter of the Tome, the party found themselves embroiled in a battle at the village of Zmei, where they fought in Strahd's name against members of the Order of the Silver Dragon. This encounter stirred buried memories in Redgrave, hinting at his possible connection to this noble order.

  Outside the Tome once more, Redgrave experimented with the wand and discovered its remarkable ability to repair and manipulate the tower itself, unveiling new possibilities and potentials for their ongoing quest. As they continued to unravel the secrets within the Tome of Strahd, each revelation brought them closer to understanding their adversary and the dark history that bound them to Barovia.
