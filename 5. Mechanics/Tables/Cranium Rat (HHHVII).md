| 10 | Cranium Rat Brain | A rodent brain, permanently altered by exposure to an illithid's psionic energy. Divorced from life, these brains have an at times unsettling ability to light up when exposed to the ambient thoughts of sentient creatures. Excavation of illithid colonies have revealed that some of their hallways have been studded with preserved brains to lend them proximity based illumination. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
