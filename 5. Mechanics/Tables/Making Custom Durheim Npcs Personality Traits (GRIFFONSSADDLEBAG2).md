| dice: d6 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I'm infinitely optimistic about the potential redemption of every spirit, even those who cause great harm. |
| 2 | I enjoy the violent parts of hunting spirits too much but am striving to find peace with the aid of my fellow monks. |
| 3 | I've helped friends and family pass on, but am still deeply troubled and meditate often on the purpose of my own life. |
| 4 | I believe that every ethereal spirit that claims to be peaceful is nonetheless capable of causing harm, so I send them to their rest by whatever means necessary.  |
| 5 | I'm terrified of ghosts, but I joined the order so that I can one day conquer my fear. |
| 6 | I was raised by the monastery, so I follow their rules and guidelines to the letter. |
