| 10 | Velociraptor Pheromones (vial) | While the claw and bite of a velociraptor is nasty, they are not overly deadly. Instead, the real value of a velociraptor is found in their pheromone glands located just below their tail. These pheromones are how these social animals coordinate their hunts, and many modern animals still have strong reactions to them from just one whiff.<br /><br />**Use.** While you have this vial of pheromones open, you have advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Animal%20Handling\|Animal Handling]]) checks made to convince an animal that is friendly to you to attack another creature. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
