| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Yeti Tongue | The howl of a yeti is renowned for either signalling, or even calling, avalanches and blizzards. Mountain clans long ago learned how to dry these tongues into reeds and place them in pipes that they believe whistle upon the approach of violent weather. | 10 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Yeti Hide | Yetis are capable of surviving in the darkest, coldest winters in part largely to their thick hides and coats. In the desperate struggle that are mountain peaks, these coats are worth more than their weight in gold, and any mountain chief would happily welcome a stranger into their hut when presented with a gift of yeti hide. | 25 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Boots Of The Winterlands.md\|Boots of the Winterlands]] |
| 15 | Yeti Eye (×2) | The literally cold stare of a yeti is a terrible final sight. It is a piercing blue that freezes one's very soul and leaves them colder than the mountain itself. The magic in these eyes can be brought out in a potion when mixed with hardy mountain roots and water melted from ancient icicles to make a brew that can preserve a creature in ice for an indefinite period of time. | 30 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Winters Rest.md\|Potion of Winter's Rest]] |
| 20 | Yeti Claw (×2) | The remains of a yeti's victims are simple to identify, for it is easy to see the way the edges of their wounds have frozen solid at the touch of the yeti. | 60 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Frostclaw Weapon.md\|Frostclaw Weapon]] |
