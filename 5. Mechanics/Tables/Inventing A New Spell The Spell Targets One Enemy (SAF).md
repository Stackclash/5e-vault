| dice: d8 | Spell Effect |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Betraying:** The target immediately attacks another target of your choice. |
| 2 | **Beguiling:** The target does not recognize you as an enemy. Until the start of your next turn, your attacks against them have advantage, and they have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells. |
| 3 | **Distracting:** On their next turn, the target can move or attack, but not both. |
| 4 | **Elucidating:** The target blurts out a closely held secret. |
| 5 | **Stupefying:** The target's Intelligence decreases to 3 until the start of their next turn. |
| 6 | **Illuminating:** Until the start of their next turn, the target glows, granting advantage on all attacks against them and illuminating any hidden allies standing adjacent to them. |
| 7 | **Confusing:** The target's next attack targets a random legal target. They will use their movement on their next turn to get closer to that target if necessary. |
| 8 | **Exposing:** The target's clothing and armor disappear until the start of their next turn. Adjust AC and abilities accordingly. |
