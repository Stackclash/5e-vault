# Chuul
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 19* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Chuul Pincer (×2) | The oversized pincer of a monstrous chuul. While too unwieldy to be fashioned into a useful weapon, the razor sharp hooks can be repurposed for useful tools, including, but not limited to, instruments of torture. | 3 gp | 40 lb | — |
| 15 | Chuul Venom (vial) | A rather nasty toxin, wringed from the tentacle appendages of the chuul. Unfortunately, the death of its owner causes it to lose much of its potency but can still be used as a base by knowledgable alchemists to create another paralysing potion. | 10 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Chuuls Caress Poison (HHHVI).md\|Chuul's Caress Poison]] |
| 20 | Arcana Ganglia | At the base of a chuul's brain lies a peculiar bundle of nerves referred to as the arcana ganglia. This highly sensitive lobe vibrates in the presence of magic and is what grants chuul's their innate ability to sense magic around them. Designed by their aboleth masters through generations of magic and breeding, there are only a handful of artificers in the world capable of repurposing it into a functioning tool capable of replicating the chuul's natural ability. | 100 gp | 5 lb | [[5.
