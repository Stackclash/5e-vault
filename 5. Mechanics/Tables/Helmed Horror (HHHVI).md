| 10 | Helmed Horror Helmet | When crafting a helmed horror, no ordinary helmet will do. One made specifically for the purpose must be commissioned in order to grant the unique senses that the helmed horror possesses. With some time, an artificer can take one of these helms and reconfigure the arcane signatures so that they work for regular humanoids. | 15 gp | 8 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Helmed Horror Essence | The animating spirit of a helmed horror dissipates quickly after its form loses structural integrity. If done quickly however, this spirit can be caught using a sheet of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]]. No matter how quick you may be however, some of the spirit will have degraded already, thus any attempt at reusing the spirit is sure to result in a lower quality construct than the original helmed horror. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an hour performing a DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]] to transfer the essence to an unworn suit of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]. If you are successful, the essence leaves the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]] and enters the suit of armor, creating an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Construct/Animated Armor.md\|animated armor]] under your control. This armor follows your instructions to the best of its ability, but lacks the intelligence to discern any nuance from your words and follows orders to the letter. This [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Construct/Animated Armor.md\|animated armor]] remains until it is destroyed. | 60 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
