| 5 | Nycaloth Ichor (vial) | **.** Nycoloth ichor is thicker and stickier than other yugoloth ichor and has a vague green tinge to it. This is odd considering that the magic it lends itself to points towards a more slippery nature. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to prepare a spell of at least 2nd level, when you begin writing with this ink you subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mirror Image.md\|mirror image]]. You may do this for a total of 4 hours, after which you successfully copy the spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source. | 70 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Nycaloth Claw (×2) | The claw of a nycaloth actually has dozens of tiny hook-like forms growing on the insides. These hooks cause massive damage when the claws rend unprotected flesh, making wounds worse with each progressive attack. While it may be considered vicious, the same principle can be applied to other weapons to give them the same combative edge. | 55 gp | 25 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sword Of Wounding.md\|Sword of Wounding]] |
| 15 | Nycaloth Wing (×2) | Like many fiends, the wings of a nycaloth can be used as a base component to make the ever useful infernal wings. Their high quality makes them particulalry useful as a material, meaning the artificer has to put relatively little effort (and money) into making them. | 230 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Gem Of Teleportation.md\|Gem of Teleportation]] |
