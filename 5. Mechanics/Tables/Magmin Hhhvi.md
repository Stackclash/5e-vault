| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Magma Shell | The leftover shell of a magmin, composed of hard magma. It is quite hard and has impressive insulation qualities that allowed it to house a destructive fire elemental. These shells make for useful tools in alchemy, and it is not uncommon for wizards to summon these creatures just to harvest their shells. | 3 sp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Magmin Pan Hhhvi.md\|Magmin Pan]] |
| 10 | Mote of Fire | When a fire elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small embers that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial Hhhvi.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 5 gp | 1 lb | Elemental Gem, Red Corundum |
