| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Vampire Blood (3 vials) | **.** The necrotic blood of a vampire, as dark and thick as blood can possibly become. While it may be foul, it does present one of the last hopes to cure the vampirism of a loved one. It is unfortunate however that such little amounts may be drawn from a slain vampire; it could be seen perhaps as a final taunt from the undead fiends.<br /><br />**Use.** A vial of vampire blood that has had the bless spell cast on it at least once a day for 7 consecutive days becomes a *vampire bane* potion. If this potion is drunk by a vampire spawn that was transformed by the vampire this potion was made from, that vampire spawn is completely cured of vampirism, reverting to their original form and alignment instantly. | 200 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Vampire Hair (large pouch) | A little known but interesting fact is that vampire hair continues to grow even after the transition to their new state, and even grows faster than it did in life. This is why vampires are so commonly seen sporting long locks of unruly hair. As a sign of their undeath, this hair possesses some degree of necrotic magic which can be literally weaved into new items. | 1,400 gp | 3 lb | Cloak of the Bat |
| 20 | Vampire Fang (×2) | The symbol of a vampire, the prolonged canines that they use to plunge into their victims and drain them of life. The same dark powers they had before can be taken and recrafted into a weapon. | 2,200 gp | 2 lb | Sword of Life Stealing |
| 25 | Vampire Heart | Even if a stake was driven through this heart, it is still harvestable as a useful item. This organ appears to drip darkness as much as it does blood. Those that have held one of these befouled organs claim to have heard whispers from the slain vampire, tempting them with power in exchange for loyalty beyond their vanquishing. | 15,000 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
