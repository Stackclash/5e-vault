| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Dragon Flesh | Despite common misconception, dragon flesh does not contain any magical benefit. It does however contain many culinary benefits. The exact flavour differs depending on the type of dragon it was taken from, but anybody that has eaten a dragon steak claims that it puts even the most exquisite aged beef to shame. There are many royal cooks and larders that would pay a high sum for just a pound of this delicacy. | 30 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 10 | [Type] Dragon Blood (5 vials) | The blood of an ancient dragon is one of the most powerful spell reagents and potion ingredients in existence. Even besides its use in the birth of half-dragon soldiers and other rituals, the most common use of potent dragon blood is to make a potion that can imbue the drinker with the same strengths as the dragon it was taken from. | 125 gp | 1 lb | Potion of Dragon Strength |
| 15 | [Type] Dragon Tooth (×10) | The teeth of a full grown ancient dragon have been the end of many a hapless adventurer. Longer than a full grown human's arm, constant exposure to the dragon's breath attack has infused them with a modicum of elemental power. A master fletcher can craft a special set of arrows from these teeth, still carrying their original elemental charge. | 25 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dragon Arrow Hhhvi.md\|Dragon Arrow]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dragon Bolt Hhhvi.md\|Dragon Bolt]] |
| 15 | [Type] Dragon Bone (×6) | The bones of a dragon are as hard and durable as the rest of their body. Not many weaponsmiths know how to reshape dragon bone, and those that do, keep it a guarded secret (most likely to avoid the ire of paranoid dragons). However, there is a good reason that myths and legends of heroes carrying dragonbone weapons abound in every culture: anyone who has seen one will agree that they simply have no equal. | 375 gp | 14 lb | Dragon Bone Weapon |
| 15 | [Type] Dragon Horn/Spine | Depending on the type of dragon, a horn or a prominent spine may adorn their head. In either case, the bony protrusion may be sawed off and used as a basis for exceptionally powerful wands and staves. | 650 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dragon Wand Hhhvi.md\|Dragon Wand]] |
| 20 | [Type] Dragon Scales (large bag) | The notoriously hard scales of an ancient dragon. Harder than steel yet surprisingly light, it is the dream of every armor-smith to craft a suit from this legendary material. Getting them is easier said than done however, as not only must one kill an ancient dragon first, they must also manage to find and safely detach the right scales needed to interlock into a functioning set of armor. | 1,675 gp | 45 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dragon Scale Mail.md\|Dragon Scale Mail]] |
| 20 | [Type] Dragon Breath Pouch | **.** When the word "dragon" is uttered, people tend to think of three things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces. While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ depending on the dragon, they all share the same destructive results. Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction.<br /><br />**Use.** May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the primary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type and DC, the damage type, and the damage amount are identical to the breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from. | 1,675 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dragons Wrath Hhhvi.md\|Dragon's Wrath]] |
| 20 | [Type] Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch (Metallic Dragons only) | **.** The metallic dragons are considered to be less violent than their chromatic cousins and this is reflected in their alternate breath weapons. While their primary breath weapons mimic those of the chromatics, all metallics dragons wield a secondary, much less harmful breath weapon. This too can be harvested and used for similar purposes as the primary dragon breath pouch.<br /><br />**Use.** May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the secondary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type, DC, and the effect are identical to the secondary breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from. | 1,675 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dragons Mercy Hhhvi.md\|Dragon's Mercy]] |
| 25 | Dragon Wing (×2) | The wings of a dragon defy any sense of natural law. Even considering their own immense size, they could not possibly lift a form as massive as the ancient dragon they bear, and yet they do. Only a magical force, inherent in their leathery membranes, could make such flight possible. Cloaks fashioned from these membranes can provide similar propulsion to other creatures, along with providing a stylistic fashion choice. | 3,250 gp | 60 lb | [[5.
