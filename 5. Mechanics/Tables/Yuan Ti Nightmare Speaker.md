# Yuan-Ti Nightmare Speaker
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 48* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Yuan-Ti Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Poison Immunity.md\|Potion of Poison Immunity]] |
| 15 | Yuan-Ti Poison (vial) | **.** The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes in nature. The poison has been described by survivors like "having one's blood transfigured into fire."<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 2d6\|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 120 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Mark of Dendar | **.** Dendar, the serpent goddess of nightmares, is revered by the aptly named nightmare speakers. She casts a pallor over sleeping mortals, inducing nightmares in them so that she may consume them in her never-ending hunger. Her most devout priestesses receive her mark so that they may call more nightmares into existence for her to devour.<br /><br />**Use.** You may use this mark in place of the usual material components when you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleep.md\|sleep]] spell. If you do so, any creature that you successfully put to sleep in this way also suffers `dice: 1d10\|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage at the end of every turn they spend asleep. This damage does not wake up the sleeping creature. Once this ability has been used 3 times, this mark crumbles into dust and becomes worthless. | 100 gp | 1 lb | — |
