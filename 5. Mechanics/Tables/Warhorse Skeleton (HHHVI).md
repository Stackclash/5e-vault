# Warhorse Skeleton
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 94* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Bone Dust (small pouch) | A skeleton touched by foul necromancy is forever changed in ways that transcend the physical. Dust from the bones of a raised skeleton continues to carry foul necromantic energies that can be recycled into other necromantic purposes and rituals. After all, necromancers are not known to waste anything. | 8 cp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Warhorse Skull | A horse touched by necromantic energy is an iconic mainstay of any battle against a necromancer. The skulls of their tainted skeletons still carry some magical energy and can be used to change the appearance of a summoned steed.<br /><br />**Use.** If you are holding the warhorse skull when you cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Steed.md\|find steed]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Greater Steed (XGE).md\|find greater steed]] spells, you may choose to have the resulting summoned mount appear skeletal in nature. This does not affect the summoned mount's abilities or statistics in any way. | 1 gp | 30 lb | — |
