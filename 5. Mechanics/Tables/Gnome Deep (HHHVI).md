| 10 | Deep Gnome Hide | The skin of the cavern dwelling gnomish subrace is a distinctive ashy-grey in colour and has adapted over millennia to a subterranean lifestyle. As such, it can be fashioned into a good cloak that provides ample camouflage when spelunking. I wouldn't recommend wearing it around civilised society however. | 1 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
