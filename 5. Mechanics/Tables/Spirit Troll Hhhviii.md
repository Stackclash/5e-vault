| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Trolloplasm (5 vials) | Even though their bodies have since become incorporeal and intangible, a spirit troll still somehow manages to leave an unholy amount of muck and grime in its wake. This strange, sticky substance has been dubbed "trollo-plasm", and carries many of the same properties that troll blood had during its life. As such, it can be used for the ubiquitous potion of healing. | 65 gp | 1 lb | Potion of Greater Healing |
| 15 | Essence of Troll | When trolls are properly vanquished, their souls are forfeit to their god Varpak for devouring. However, since a spirit troll is entirely formed of soul, and since Varpak is apparently a messy eater, some trace amounts remain behind which can be trapped in [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]] and reused for later. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]].** | 575 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of The Spirit Hunter Hhhviii.md\|Amulet of the Spirit Hunter]] |
