`dice: [[Making Custom Antronec Guild Npcs Ideals (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md#^ideal]]`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Perfection.** I cannot permit even one imperfection to spoil my craft. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Self-improvement.** If each project is better than the last, my life is worthwhile. (Good) |
| 3 | **Beauty.** A true crafter brings utility and artistic wonder into the world. (Good) |
| 4 | **Hard Work.** I may not be as talented as others, but I compensate by giving all of my effort. (Lawful) |
| 5 | **Ambition.** I care about success, and in Antronec, the gateway is climbing the Guild ranks. (Any) |
| 6 | **Change.** A significant portion of art is how it changes the world, for better or worse. I want my work to move civilizations and mountains. (Chaotic) |
