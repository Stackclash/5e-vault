# Cambion
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 17* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Cambion Sulfur (small pouch) | Unlike most fiends, a cambion does not dissolve when it is slain. Its bizarre physiology however does still react strangely on death with parts of its body spontaneously combusting as it dies. These reactions are not enough to destroy the body, but it does create small piles of sulfur that are quite useful in various demonology related projects. | 7 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Devil-Tinged Blood (3 vials) | As the child of a fiend and a human, the blood of a cambion possesses certain magical properties that are even more powerful due to their compatibility with humanoid physiology. | 4 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Philter Of Love.md\|Philter of Love]] |
| 15 | Cambion Wing (×2) | As with many fiends, the wings of a cambion are useful in creating the famous item: [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|infernal wings]]. When taken whole, they can serve as a majority of the base, forming bat wings when the final item is put to use. | 30 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
