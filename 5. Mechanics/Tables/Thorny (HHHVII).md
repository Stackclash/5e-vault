| 10 | Thorny Thorns (small bag) | Through some unknown system, [[5. Mechanics/Traps Hazards/Russet Mold (VGM).md\|russet mold]] is able to detect whether it is infesting a humanoid or a beast and mutate accordingly. As such, beasts spawn what are known as a "thorny". A marked difference between a thorny and a vegepygmy is its lack of a frill, instead growing scores of its eponymous thorns. While quite sharp, they lose their form quickly once its original owner has died. When mulched however, they make a fantastic fertilizer (but the resulting plants are known to be considerably more thorny than they would otherwise). | 2 gp | 4 lb | â€” |
