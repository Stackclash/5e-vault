| — | Yeenoghu's Hide | The shaggy, matted fur of Yeenoghu is thicker and more twisted than coils of barbed steel. Soaked in the blood and gristle of the countless scores of defenseless prey, this hide is literally dripping with dark power. Some say that the Gnoll Lord even goes so far as to sew partches of skin into his own fur, creating a nightmarish patchwork of all his past atrocities. | — | 50 lb | [[5.
