# Deathlock Wight
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 17* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Bone Heart | The black heart of a deathlock no longer serves any useful biological function. In fact, more often than not, it has ossified from exposure to necromantic energies and more resembles an anatomical model than an actual organ. While the necromantic energies seeped into it are relatively weak, they are admittedly quite captivating to look at, and some shadier mages have been known to use the heart as a morbid arcane focus. | 5 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 15 | Chained Soul | A deathlock rises when the spirit of a mortal bound to a patron fails to uphold their end of a pact. When this occurs, their soul is chained by their wrathful patron, refused entry to the afterlife, and hurtled back into their former body to resume their duty. While this is tragic for the deathlock, this chaining also makes their spirit particularly easy to capture in a ream of spirit paper and made to do your own bidding. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the vengeful spirit trapped inside which takes the form of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Specter.md\|specter]] (the DM has the creature's statistics) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This specter acts next round on its own initiative and follows any verbal orders you give it (no action required). The specter lasts for 1 minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, after which it disappears. | 30 gp | 1 lb | — |
