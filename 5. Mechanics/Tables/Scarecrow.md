| 5 | Scarecrow Cloth | **.** The terrifying visage of the scarecrow, embodied in the sack cloth that constitutes its head. It remains as intimidating as it was when its host was still active, as its empty eyes still seem to see those around it.<br /><br />**Use.** When worn, you can may target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you as an action. If that target can also see you, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] until the end of your next turn. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]]. Once this ability has been used, this item loses all magic and becomes worthless. | 1 gp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Evil Spirit | The spirit of the evil creature that was used to animate the scarecrow remains around for a few moments even after its host body has been destroyed. With some spirit paper available, this spirit can be harvested and resold to less scrupulous mages. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].** | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
