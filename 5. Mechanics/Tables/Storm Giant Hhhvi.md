| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lock of Storm Giant Hair | Resembling sparks running over a field in a storm, the hair of a storm giant is considered a valuable resource to artificers. Still containing remnants of power from their original hosts, these hairs are often used as catalysts when performing the intricate spellwork required in crafting magical items. | 150 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Storm Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the storm giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 350 gp | 2 lb | Potion of Storm Giant Strength |
| 20 | Storm Giant Spine | Lightning courses through every fibre of a storm giant's being, but nowhere is this more pronounced than their spinal columns. A few choice vertebrae can create a powerful tool that would make a great addition to any laboratory. | 900 gp | 80 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Storm Pole Hhhvi.md\|Storm Pole]] |
