# Githyanki Knight
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 54* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Githyanki Hair Braid | The hair braid of a mighty githyanki warrior is a symbol of their prowess in combat. An intact braid can fetch a tidy sum among collectors back on the Material Plane. | 20 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Githyanki Heart | The githyanki are not originally a species native to the Astral Plane, and yet they have made it their home regardless. Prolonged exposures to the unaging nature of the Astral Plane has caused some of their organs, particularly their hearts, to develop curious qualities that are valuable to scholars attempting to unlock the secrets of that place. | 5 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Githyanki Brain | The githyanki brain is a marvel of biology. Capable of psionic output powerful enough to bend the normal laws of physics, it is noticeably larger and more developed than most other humanoid's. Although doing so may be distasteful for civilised folk, consuming the brain of a githyanki can temporarily boost the latent psionic powers of other humanoids, granting them similar abilities to its previous owner.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may consume the githyanki brain. For the next hour, you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mage Hand.md\|mage hand]] spell as a cantrip, as well as cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Jump.md\|jump]] spell up to 3 times. | 10 gp | 4 lb | — |
