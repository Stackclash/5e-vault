# Kuo-Toa Whip
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 71* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Kuo-Toa Teeth (small pouch) | The bite of a kuo-toa is not particularly deadly to anything larger than a river fish. Their unique shape however lends them well to doubling as fishing hooks, and many anglers swear that their yields increase when using kuo-toa hooks. | 8 cp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Kuo-Toa Skin | Kuo-toa skin is notoriously slippery, owing to a mucus that the kuo-toa produces at all times. Soaking a fresh skin in this mucus helps to create a waterproof, if disgusting, tarp. | 1 sp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Kuo-Toa Brain | The brain of the kuo-toa is one racked by madness as a result of generations of exposure to illithid domination. Placing this brain in a crucible, removing impurities, and then boiling with various compatible catalysts creates a potion that can grant a drinker some of the otherworldly senses of a kuo-toa. | 8 sp | 2 lb | [[5.
