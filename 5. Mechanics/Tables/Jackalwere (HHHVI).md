| 10 | Jackalwere Eye (×2) | The mesmerising eyes of a jackalwere are able to lure unwary travellers into a slumber, and many commonfolk that live in areas frequented by jackalweres make a habit of looking down when speaking to strangers.<br /><br />**Use.** If you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleep.md\|sleep]] spell you may use a jackalwere eye as a material component. If you do so, you roll an additional `dice:1d8\|noform\|avg` (`1d8`) when determining the amount of hit points affected. You may only use one jackalwere eye at a time, and once used, a jackalwere eye loses its magic and becomes useless. | 8 sp | 2 lb | — |
