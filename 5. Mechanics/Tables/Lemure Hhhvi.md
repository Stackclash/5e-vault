| 10 | Lemure Essence | The blobbish, fetid body of the lemure is useful for little in both life and in death. Their essence on the other hand is much more useful, as it serves as the currency of the Nine Hells (due to price fluctuations, the value of an individual lemure soul may differ depending on the time of reading). As the lemure technically belongs to the devil who corrupted its original soul in the first place, do beware when harvesting these as there may be a devil who is less than pleased about being robbed. | 5 sp | 1 lb | â€” |
