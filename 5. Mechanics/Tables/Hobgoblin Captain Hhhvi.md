| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Hobgoblin Ear | The body of a hobgoblin holds little practical use for harvesters. Most cities however will pay small bounties for hobgoblin ears. | 2 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Hobgoblin War Braid | As a hobgoblin grows in experience and prestige, they grow out their hair into braids that are only ever cut if they lose a battle. These braids hold some value to collectors as well as bounty offices as proof of felling a noteworthy hobgoblin threat. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
