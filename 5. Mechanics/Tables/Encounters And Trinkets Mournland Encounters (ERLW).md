| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The party meets flickering images of their future selves who are trying desperately to communicate, but their message is garbled. |
| 2 | The party encounters a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Revenant.md\|revenant]] who was murdered by House Cannith assassins after she learned too much about the house's secret research. The characters can appease her by promising to help her get revenge. |
| 3 | A tiny kitten mews from inside a hollow log. Within a few hours after being freed, it grows into an adult [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Displacer Beast.md\|displacer beast]]. |
| 4 | The apparition of a parent searches for their lost child. As soon as the two are reunited, parent and spirit child both vanish. |
| 5 | The mist congeals into the form of a long-lost love of one of the adventurers. The mist apparition (use the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Ghost.md\|ghost]] stat block) wants the character to stay here forever. |
| 6 | The characters come across the skull of a buried warforged colossus. |
