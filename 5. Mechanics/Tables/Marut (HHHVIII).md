# Marut
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 51* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Sigil Oil (5 vials) | The oil that flows through the marut is no simple lubricant found on a cheap tinker's toy. It is believed that this oil is refined from the drippings of Primus himself, their oil giving life to their greatest creation. This oil is highly coveted by mortal crafters to use when making their own constructs as it is believed that they lend a more lifelike quality to their creation's movements. | 100 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 15 | Marut Hand (×2) | Forged with mechanical precision under hammers timed to the eternally ticking gears of Mechanus, the hands of a marut are as close to godly perfection as can be achieved in the metallic form. Capable of striking down even fiendish lords and celestial beings in service of the marut's goal of enforcing the law, these hands are almost impossible to work with for a mortal crafter. Yet, for the rare individual that can, a truly remarkable set of gauntlets can be created, one that can turn even mortals into executioners of the gods. | 1,000 gp | 50 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mechanus Gauntlets (HHHVIII).md\|Mechanus Gauntlets]] |
| 20 | Marut Metal | The alloy that constitutes a marut's frame cannot be found anywhere on the Material Plane. In fact, it cannot be found anywhere outside of Mechanus as it is actually smelted from the ancient gears of the modron home world. This metal is supremely durable yet lightweight, and traces of it have been found mixed into legendary pieces of weapons and armor across the realms. But, if you manage to scavenge a full intact shell of it, a worthy blacksmith can craft a suit of armor that will protect you from supernatural harm. | 4,000 gp | 200 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Primus Plate (HHHVIII).md\|Primus Plate]] |
| 25 | Enforcer's Eye | Cultures all across the Material Plane tend to share tales of leaders that sacrifice an eye in order to gain otherworldly levels of wisdom and judgement. While many are familiar with the subsequent exploits of these leaders, they never end up explaining what happens to the eye they sacrificed. Well, long story short, they end up on Sigil, where the modron leader, Primus, takes them and plants them into the marut where it grows to the size of a melon as the final step of their construction. These eyes see with both the wisdom of the universe and the empathy of mortals and they are what allow the marut to hunt and judge their contract holders better than any lesser construct possibly could.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding the eye, you may use your action to close your eyes and focus, allowing you to see through the eye. While seeing through the eye, you have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet, you are unaffected by visual illusions, and you automatically succeed on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) check to determine if a creature is lying or not. You stop seeing through the eye if you ever open your own eyes (no action required) or if the eye ever leaves your hand. | 14,000 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 30 | Edict Engine | The edict engine is a swirling vortex of pure energy that powers the marut and allows its massive form to move with all the strength and grace of the mightiest angels. In a feat of engineering capable only from Primus itself, the engine runs on the logic of the Multiverse itself, keeping the marut operational so long as the ancient contract that binds the laws of physics together remains upheld. This engine is so perfect in its design that any attempt by mortal hands to tinker with it would ruin it irreparably.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding this item, you may use your action to activate it, causing all creatures within a 30-foot radius to take `dice:45\|noform\|avg` (`45`) radiant damage. Any creature that took any of that damage must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of your next turn. Once used, this item cannot be used again until the next dawn. Every time this item is used, there is a 10 percent chance that it breaks apart due to mortal negligence and becomes useless. | 20,000 gp | 60 lb | — |
