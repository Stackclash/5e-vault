# Nothic
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 80* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Nothic Brain | The nothic brain is immense; existing as both a testament and mockery to the nothic's former intellectual callings. Despite its veil of madness, wells of knowledge still exist within it, for those that know how to bring it out.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend 1 day pulping, drying, and mixing this item with various reagents. The resulting mixture creates a magical ink that contains magical knowledge. A character with at least 3 levels in the wizard class may use this ink to write in their spellbook. If they do so, they subconsciously write down a random spell (chosen by the DM) of 2nd level or lower into their spellbook. Regardless of the level of the spell, this transcription takes 2 hours and costs nothing except the usage of all the ink. This copied spell functions as well as any other spell copied into the book through a mundane method. | 30 gp | 4 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Nothic Eye | The bulging, lidless eye of a nothic is its main source of power. Capable of seeing more than mortals were meant to, it provides a good framework for constructing magical devices capable of performing similar feats as its original owner. | 20 gp | 3 lb | [[5.
