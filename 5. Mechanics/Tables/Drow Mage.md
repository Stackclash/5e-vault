| 10 | Drow Blood (3 vials) | Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of Lolth, drow blood possesses some unique property that when re-brewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers. | 1 gp | 1 lb | Drow Poison |
| 15 | Drow heart | **.** Obviously, every drow has a heart (despite any evidence to the contrary), yet only the powerful in their society are blessed enough by Lolth for their hearts to be worth anything. As a drow climbs in their society, Lolth's rewards to them begin to compound, causing them to become slightly more magical. Upon their death, their hearts may be removed and this magic released to simulate the gifts that Lolth once offered them in life.<br /><br />**Use.** By using an action to stab the heart with a knife, the user may use the *summon demon* ability listed in the drow mage's statblock. After this, the heart is rendered useless. In order to use this ability, the user must be able to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Summon Lesser Demons.md\|summon lesser demons]] spell. | 30 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
