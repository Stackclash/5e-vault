# Ankheg
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 11* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Ankheg Chitin | Extremely hard, but too unwieldy and uncomfortable to use in making armor. The ankheg's hide still finds some uses as a building material, especially for subterranean dwellers who appreciate its suitability to rocky environments. | 1 gp | 30 lb | — |
| 10 | Ankheg Gaster | A series of bladders in the hindquarters of an ankheg, this organ is analogous to the intestines of a humanoid. Although ankhegs are known for eating flesh, they absorb the majority of their nutrients from the soil they burrow through. Artificers are able to take this fact and create a handy survival tool for explorers with a strong stomach. | 2 gp | 9 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Canteen Of Last Resort.md\|Canteen of Last Resort]] |
| 15 | Ankheg Bile (2 vials) | **.** Ankhegs are well known for their incredibly potent digestive fluids that dissolve their prey. As such, alchemists find ankheg bile to be a particularly useful ingredient when creating their own acidic concoctions.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) acid damage. | 4 gp | 1 lb | — |
