**The Spell Targets You or One Ally**

| dice: d8 | Spell Effect |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Empowering:** For 10 minutes, a random ability score of the target increases to 20. |
| 2 | **Regenerating:** For the spell's duration, the target regains hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier at the start of each round. |
| 3 | **Mindful:** For 10 minutes, the target may use your spellcasting ability modifier for all saving throws. |
| 4 | **Omniscient:** For 10 minutes, the target grows a third eye that reveals hidden, disguised, and invisible creatures within 60 feet, but not objects on other planes. |
| 5 | **Levitating:** For 10 minutes, the target gains a fly speed of 10 feet. |
| 6 | **Invulnerable:** Until the start of their next turn, the target is immune to all damage. |
| 7 | **Topologically Ambiguous:** For 10 minutes, there is a one-third chance at the start of each round that the target can teleport 10 feet as a bonus action. The odds of teleporting are cumulative (33% chance on the first round, 66% on the second, 100% on the third), but the odds reset each time the target teleports. The target can choose not to teleport, but if they do so, the odds still reset. |
| 8 | **Blazing:** Until the start of their next turn, the target's movement leaves a trail of fire that lasts for the spell's duration and does 3d6 damage (Dexterity save for half) to anyone who begins their turn in it or moves into or through it. |
