# Yuan-Ti Pit Master
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 48* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Yuan-Ti Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Poison Immunity.md\|Potion of Poison Immunity]] |
| 15 | Yuan-Ti Poison (vial) | **.** The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes in nature. The poison has been described by survivors like "having one's blood transfigured into fire."<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 2d6\|avg\|noform` (`2d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 120 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Mark of Merrshaulk | **.** Merrshaulk, the Master of the Pit, was once the prime deity of the yuan-ti pantheon before he was unseated in some unknown event. He slumbers now, but still lends his mark (a cobra head) to his most devout followers: the stoic pit masters. With his blessing, they maintain the traditions of the yuan-ti, whether that be through diplomacy or by force.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding this mark, if you are forced to roll a saving throw to resist being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] or put to sleep, you may invoke the power of this mark to automatically succeed on that saving throw. Once this ability has been used 5 times, this mark crumbles into dust and becomes worthless. | 100 gp | 1 lb | — |
