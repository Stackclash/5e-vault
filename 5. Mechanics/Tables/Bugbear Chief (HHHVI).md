# Bugbear Chief
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 15* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Bugbear Hide | Despite usually being filthy and riddled with mange, an intact bugbear hide can actually serve as very good leather. It is not uncommon for more nomadic people to wear these tanned hides for both comfort and as a sign of their strength. | 8 sp | 13 lb | — |
| 15 | Heart of Hruggek | The most fearsome of bugbears carry with them the blessing of their god Hruggek which allows them to surge past any danger and debilitations. If you are willing to indulge in your own inner savage, you too can take this blessing by consuming the bugbear's heart, but beware of any side effects.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to consume this heart. If you do so, you have advantage on saving throws against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|put to sleep]] for the next hour. Once this effect wears off, you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] as the adrenaline filled organ passes through your system. | 1 gp | 6 lb | — |
