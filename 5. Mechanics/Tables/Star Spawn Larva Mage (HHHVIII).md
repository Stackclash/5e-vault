| 10 | Star Spawn Venom (3 vials) | It is questionable if the toxins that line the fangs of star spawn worms are toxins at all. Analysis by the finest alchemical minds can find no resemblance between it and any other toxin found on our plane. As such, it is widely believed that their "venomous" nature is simply the fact that their makeup is so foreign to our bodies that they simply do not know how to react and they shut down instead to prevent even worse harm.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d8\|noform\|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage and become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of your turn. | 230 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Star Worms (large pouch) | The worms that constitute the writhing mass of the larva mage are unlike any found on any of the familiar planes. They do not breed and they do not eat in ways that make sense to the rest of us. Vivisection has revealed that they have no internal organs, and are really more akin to writhing black tubes of organic star dust. Study into them remains difficult, especially since any researcher that does so seems to descend into madness soon after. The only reliable use for these worms have been discovered by halfcrazed alchemists that have rendered them down into a concoction that is surprisingly spicy in flavor. | 1,850 gp | 3 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Alien Consciousness | The alien consciousness that merges with a cultist to form a larva mage is so strange and foreign to us that to even behold it is to go mad. The most we can hope to do is trap a whisper of it inside [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]] and hand it to a crafter that has the mental fortitude to handle such a volatile essence. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].** | 4,000 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of The Expanded Mind (HHHVIII).md\|Amulet of the Expanded Mind]] |
