| 15 | Brain Fluid (vial) | **.** The fluid that oozes through an intellect devourer is not unlike the mucus secreted by their illithid masters. This fluid however has the unique ability to carry and pass on memories to those that consume it.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may drink a vial of brain fluid. If you do so you must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you become stunned for 1 minute as your mind fails to process the information flooding through it. On a success, you learn the identity of who this intellect devourer used to be, as well as one key memory. The key memory is up to the discretion of the DM, but may be something that the intellect devourer knew in its original life, or something it has learned after becoming an intellect devourer. | 4 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Living Brainstem | **.** Living is a strong word in this case. Used here, it really means that the brain still has some capacity for interaction and response to stimuli, due largely to the dark rituals used to transform it into an intellect devourer. While it would be much more merciful to put the brain out of its misery by destroying it entirely, it still offers some use for an adventurer with a strong stomach.<br /><br />**Use.** For 6 hours after an intellect devourer's death, its main brain continues to send weak signals of psionic wavelengths. When the brain is worn directly on top of a humanoid's head, that humanoid becomes immune to the detect sentience ability of intellect devourers. Instead, an intellect devourer that detects that humanoid will assume that humanoid is a host of a living intellect devourer and will treat them accordingly. However, an intellect devourer that can see without using its blindsight will still notice that a humanoid is wearing a brain on the top of their head and will also react accordingly. | 12 gp | 6 lb | — |
