| 5 | Shadow Mastiff Drool (2 vials) | Shadow mastiff drool drips like tar and is infused with the all-consuming darkness of the Shadowfell. While it may seem strange, Shadowfell inhabitants have been known to brew this drool into a hallucinogenic drink called "eclipse." When imbibed, eclipse causes the drinker to see "inverted light", making dark areas seem bright and bright areas seem dark. Frequent users of this drink can be identified by the telltale black circles with white outlines that stain their eyes and lips. | 1 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Shadow Mastiff Fur (small bag) | The fur of a shadow mastiff has an odd consistency, somehow combining attributes of a solid, liquid, and gas all at once. While it is a hard material to work with, its soft texture, and alluring movement make it a popular choice for making entertainingly macabre garments. | 2 gp | 5 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Shadow Mastiff Teeth (small bag) | Too small to make a weapon, too uneven to make an arrowhead, a shadow mastiff's teeth are difficult to repurpose despite their useful ability to blend into the shadows. Thankfully, a crafty blacksmith realized that they could be made into a set of sneaky caltrops with only some slight modifications. | 4 gp | 3 lb | [[5.
