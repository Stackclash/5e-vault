| 20 | Demonic Imprint | As the shadow demon lacks a substantial form, there is nothing to harvest from it except its spiritual essence. However, if one manages to capture this essence using spirit paper, they will essentially hold complete dominion over said demon. At this point, the spirit paper has a myriad of uses, but the most popular among demonologists is to transfer the essence to a demon amulet. This gives the owner the ability to resummon the demon in their proper physical form, while still maintaining complete control over them. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].** | 160 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shadow Amulet (HHHVI).md\|Shadow Amulet]] |
