| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Treant Sap (3 vials) | Treant sap flows through its body like blood and is rich with both nutrients and magical energy. When diluted in water, a single vial of this sap is enough to fertilise a whole farm for a year. | 7 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Treant Bark | The bark of a treant is harder than that of an ordinary tree, having been blessed with the power of the forest itself. This bark is hard enough to create an armor that many druids enjoy wearing into battle. | 150 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wooden Breastplate (HHHVI).md\|Wooden Breastplate]] |
| 20 | Treant Root | Every treant has one main root that serves as the equivalent of a heart in humanoids. The treant draws most of their nourishment from this root and thus it is also imbued with the greatest amount of magical power. These roots can be recrafted into powerful magical items, especially the renowned staff of the woodlands. | 400 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Staff Of The Woodlands.md\|Staff of the Woodlands]] |
