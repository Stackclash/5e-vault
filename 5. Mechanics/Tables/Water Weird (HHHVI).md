| 10 | Living Water (vial) | A water weird that has dispersed into water upon death still carries some semblance of magic in it, if only for a few fleeting moments. If scooped up quickly and preserved properly, it can be used in various minor water magics. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 30 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Decanter Of Endless Water.md\|Decanter of Endless Water]] |
| 15 | Mote of Water | When a water elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small balls of foam that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degredation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 100 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elemental Gem Emerald.md\|Elemental Gem, Emerald]] |
