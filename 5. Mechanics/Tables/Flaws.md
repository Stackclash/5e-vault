# Flaws

`dice: [[Flaws.md#^flaws]]`

| Flaws |
|-------|
| I refuse to believe that there is a problem that can't be solved by the right plant—even if it's really obvious this isn't a situation that calls for them. |
| I can become very distracted if I see a herb that I want, and I will drop everything else to go get it. |
| dice: d6 | Flaw |
| I tend to exaggerate the quality of my harvested wares to inflate their price. |
| Once I decide that a creature will become my next trophy, nothing will stop me from getting it. |
| I am regularly covered in dirt and fertiliser that many find off putting. |
| I'm always looking for the next big hunt, something that will probably get me killed. |
| I see other living creatures as just organs in a skin bag, waiting to be sold. |
| Once I kill something, I will drop everything to take a trophy from it before moving on. |
| I consider all plants to be sentient beings and I have to ask them permission before I do anything that would damage them. |
| Secretly, I have little regard to the sustainability of gathering too many herbs—all I care is what use they have to serve me. |
| Some would say I get a little too much pleasure in slicing corpses open and tearing out their fresh organs. |
| I value plant life over animal life and I will gladly sacrifice the latter to save the former. |
