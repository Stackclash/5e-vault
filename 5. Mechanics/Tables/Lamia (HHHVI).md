*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 72* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lamia Blood (5 vials) | As servants of Graz'zt, lamias are the living embodiment of charm and lust. Their blood reflects this and is one of many potential catalysts used when brewing the dreaded philter of love. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Philter Of Love.md\|Philter of Love]] |
| 15 | Lamia Claw (×2) | Those that have felt the gentle caress of a lamia know that there is a powerful magic imbued in their limbs. With some careful crafting, this magic can be harnessed into a weapon even beyond the death of its original owner. | 15 gp | 9 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Charming Knife (HHHVI).md\|Charming Knife]] |
| 20 | Lamia Eye (×2) | Lamias treasure beauty above all else, going so far as casting illusions on their own realms to increase their aesthetic appeal. These visions of beauty are so persistent, that even after death, they remain in the lamia's eyes, waiting for an artificer to coax them out again. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lenses Of The Oasis (HHHVI).md\|Lenses of the Oasis]] |
