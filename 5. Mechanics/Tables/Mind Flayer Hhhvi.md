| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Mind Flayer Mucus (vial) | The mucus secreted by a well fed mind flayer has a slightly sticky texture and smells roughly of weak formaldehyde. Filled with the thoughts and emotions of the mind flayer's meals, this mucus can undergo an alchemical process to turn into an intoxicating draught known as: Whisper. When consumed, the drinker experiences a rush of euphoria as dozens of minds recount lost knowledge and memories in a cascade of mental whispers. While unpleasant, this drink is considered a high honour in many Underdark societies. | 10 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Mind Flayer Tentacle (×4) | The mouth tentacle of the mind flayer is renowned for affecting more than the physical on every lash. It retains this property beyond the death of its owner, and Underdark interrogators are rumoured to use whips made of these tentacles in their work. | 6 gp | 4 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mind Whip Hhhvi.md\|Mind Whip]] |
| 15 | Mind Flayer Heart | A mind flayer heart is a dark organ, filled with vile humours and thin ichors. When transformed into an amulet, it can grant many of the psionic abilities of an illithid, but at a terrible price. | 50 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of The Mind Flayer Hhhvi.md\|Amulet of the Mind Flayer]] |
| 20 | Mind Flayer Brain | **.** The incredibly powerful brain of the mind flayer seems to still throb with activity even after removal from its skull. Due to the unique physiology of the illithid race, the consciousness of the mind flayer is still present in the brain, allowing it to be exploited by both adventurers and by the mind flayer's elder brain master alike.<br /><br />**Use.** Despite being dead, the intact brain of a mind flayer is treated as if it were still a living mind for the purposes of spells and abilities that can interact directly with minds such as the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]] spell. Any time a creature interacts with the mind flayer brain in this way, there is a 90% chance that the elder brain that the mind flayer had a psychic link with becomes aware of this interaction and what occurred during this interaction. | 185 gp | 6 lb | [[5.
