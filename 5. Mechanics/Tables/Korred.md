| 10 | Korred Hoof (×2) | **.** A korred's hoof is as sensitive to the earth as a bat's ears are to sound. Small air pockets inside these hooves allow them to vibrate from the slightest tremor in the ground and make them surprisingly light. Duergar have been found using these hooves as tools in their spelunking, but there is nothing stopping the rest of us from doing the same if we ever find ourselves in the possession of one.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding this item against stone or soil, you gain a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#tremorsense\|tremorsense]] out to a range of 30 feet. | 20 gp | 8 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Boots Of Stone Strength.md\|Boots of Stone Strength]] |
| 15 | Korred Scalp | **.** Korred hair is one of the most unique materials in the Multiverse, capable of transforming into whatever material is used to cut it. If one wants to keep the hair in its versatile state, there is a relatively grisly workaround: taking the korred's whole scalp. If you do so, it is advised that one braids the hair before storing it, as the hair becomes quite brittle and prone to damage upon the death of the korred.<br /><br />**Use.** This scalp contains 10 braids of 1 foot in length each. When cut, these braids permanently transform into whatever material was used to cut it. Once all hair has been removed from this scalp, it becomes useless. | Varies | 10 lb | — |
| 20 | Korred Hide | Stone grey and rough like granite, a korred's hide is not a pleasant thing to touch. It does however possess many magical properties that impart the korred with its famous stone swimming abilities. When used as the inner lining of a suit of armor, these properties can be transferred to its wearer (just ensure you wear a comfortable undershirt when doing so). | 150 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
