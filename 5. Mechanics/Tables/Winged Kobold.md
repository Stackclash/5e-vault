# Winged Kobold
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 69* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Kobold Teeth (small pouch) | Like a crocodile, kobolds continuously grow and lose teeth throughout their lives. As such, their jaws tend to be lined with razor sharp rows of fresh pearly-whites. Kobolds use these for tools and there is no reason why other races should refuse to do the same if the opportunity presented itself. | 8 cp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Kobold Wing (×2) | On a rare occasion, a kobold is born with a pair of wings. While small and relatively weak, the canvas-like skin make for a comfortable connective material in leatherworking. Of course, most leatherworkers advertise it "dragon flaps," since that has a nicer sound than "dead kobold skin." | 1 sp | 8 lb | — |
