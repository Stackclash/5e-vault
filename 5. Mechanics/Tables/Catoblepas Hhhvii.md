| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Catoblepas Milk (1 gallon) | The pale, vaguely reddish milk of a catoblepas smells worse than it looks. It is easy to mistake even fresh catoblepas milk as having gone rancid, due to its sharp taste and odor. Despite this, it is considerably valuable, as it is the basis for the gourmet foodstuff: death cheese. | 5 gp | 9 lb | — |
| 10 | Catoblepas Fur (large pouch) | The thick, mangy red fur of the catoblepas looks and feels more like the decayed vegetable matter that one would find at the bottom of the swamp it lives in. The unique structure of this fur makes it the perfect trap for bacteria and disease. While many would thus assume that this fur is a vector for plague, this very property actually makes it a wonderful filter, and when cleaned and dried properly can actually be used to make even the most polluted water into something potable. | 10 gp | 7 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Filter Rag Hhhvii.md\|Filter Rag]] |
| 15 | Catoblepas Tail | A solid tail, capable of rattling a knight wearing the sturdiest plate. Taken, treated with oils, and reinforced with steel strips turns this monstrous act of nature into a deadly weapon on the battlefield. | 25 gp | 15 lb | [+1 Flail](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 20 | Catoblepas Eye (×2) | The catoblepas is the natural embodiment of death and decay, and nowhere is this better exemplified than in their eyes. Filled with necrotic energy rarely seen outside of the undead, these eyes wither anything they look at, turning fresh bodies into suitable fare for the catoblepas. Artificers have learned to take these orbs and transform them into deadly lenses with much of the same ability. | 42 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Withering Lenses Hhhvii.md\|Withering Lenses]] |
