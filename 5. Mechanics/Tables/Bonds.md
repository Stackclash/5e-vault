|-------|
| In order to prove my honour and bravery, I am searching for a legendary plant to bring back and present to the elders of my hometown. |
| I will sow the seeds of my favourite flower wherever I go and ensure the world blooms with its beauty. |
| I seek a plant that can cure an illness that has plagued my home village for generations. |
| I am interested in studying the anatomy of rare and magical creatures and I need samples to continue my research. |
| Visions of a monstrously large creature haunt my dreams. They won't stop until I find it and claim its pelt for my cloak. |
| As an infant, my life was saved when a wandering herbalist used medicinal plants to break my fever. I vow to bring the same natural healing to everyone in the same way. |
| Hunting and harvesting creatures is the only way I know how to make money and feed my family. |
| I am a student of science and I want field research in gathering and applying herbs in real-life situations. |
| Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of wearing a unicorn fur cloak. If you have a better way of getting one, I'd like to hear it. |
| My clan won't respect me unless I bring back the head of a rare and dangerous creature. |

| Harvesting creatures has been my family's profession for generations; I'm just continuing this long line of tradition. |
| My goal is to make enough money to retire to my own plot of land, where I will spend my time growing the exotic herbs I found on my journey. |
