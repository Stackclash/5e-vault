# Steel Predator
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 67* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Target's Spoor | At the core of a steel predator is a trace of its primary target: it is this identifiable possession that defines the steel predator's purpose and entire existence. This item can be recovered if the predator's body isn't too damaged, but it is quite a mixed bag on what may pop out. | Variable | N/A | — |
| 10 | Steel Predator Claw (×4) | The claws of the steel predator take inspiration from many of the beasts through the multiverse and are intended to be machine-precise weapons of perfection. The compositing alloy alone is the envy of blacksmiths everywhere, and they can easily be reforged into an incredibly sharp weapon. | 150 gp | 30 lb | +2 Melee Piercing or Slashing Weapon |
| 15 | Predator Sensor | Located where the brain would be in a normal creature, the predator sensor resembles a large black tuning fork with several rings of notches on its prongs. This sensor is one of the finest tracking implements ever invented and is capable of both tracking prey across dimensions and supplying the predator with incredibly sharp senses. With a slight bit of tinkering, it can be rewired to hook into the senses of a normal creature with much the same effect. | 1,150 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Helm Of The Predator (HHHVIII).md\|Helm of the Predator]] |
| 20 | Artificial Voice Box | The voice box of a steel predator is capable of releasing a cacophony of noise that seems to be the perfect fusion of every apex predator's roar and howl. This terrifying noise speaks to something primal inside the mind, bypassing the fight-or-flight response and landing simply on freeze.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may activate this voice box, emitting a roar in a 60-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:5d10\|noform\|avg` (`5d10`) thunder damage, drops everything it's holding, and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this item cannot be used again until the next dawn. In addition, every time this item is used, there is a 25 percent chance that it falls apart from lack of maintenance and becomes useless. | 2,220 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 25 | Adaptive Plating | Although the steel predator is a heartless metal construct, the master craftsmanship that went into it means that it moves, fights, and hunts much like a real beast. This is especially true in its mastercrafted metal plating which flexes and bends as if it were skin. While such incredible smithing is impossible for any mortal to achieve, they are still capable of reusing existing samples into a durable armor that feels more like a second skin than a full set of plate. | 6,750 gp | 90 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Terminator Armor (HHHVIII).md\|Terminator Armor]] |
