# Quasit
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 25*

| 5 | Quasit Venom (vial) | Quasit venom is more of an annoyance than a serious threat, but the paralysis side effect can certainly ruin someone's day. When mixed with other ingredients however, this venom can serve as one of many potential bases for a potion of poison. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Poison.md\|Potion of Poison]] |
| 10 | Quasit Blood (vial) | **.** Quasit blood is as thin and slippery as the demon it came from, but serves as an excellent spell component for lower-tier magic.<br /><br />**Use.** The next time you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell, you may consume a vial of quasit blood instead of using the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the quasit's statblock. Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar next disappears or is dismissed. | 10 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
