| 5 | Hell Hound Fur (3 tufts) | **.** When a hell hound dies, it is consumed by its internal fire leaving nothing behind but ash of burnt fur. While this is disappointing to harvesters, the fur still has some utility.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may rub 1 tuft of hell hound fur into your hands. If you do so, for the next minute, whenever you roll a 1 or 2 on a fire damage dice roll, you may reroll that die and you must use the new number. After being used, the tuft of hell hound fur loses its magic and becomes useless. | 10 gp | 2 lb | â€” |
