| 5 | Salamander Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a salamander continues to boil with a furious energy long after the salamander's death. Smiths around the world value samples of this blood as a potent fuel source for their forges that allow them to smelt metals that they could not otherwise. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Salamander Fire.md\|Salamander Fire]] |
| 10 | Fire Snake Scales (small pouch) | Salamander scales stay supernaturally warm even after removal from their body. It is not uncommon for wealthy merchants to have winter beds lined with these scales to keep them comfortable in the colder months. Unfortunately, the scales of a young salamander are too soft and small to be used for a set of armor. | 3 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Warming Waterskin.md\|Warming Waterskin]] |
