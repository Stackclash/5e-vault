| 15 | Gazer Eyestalk | The tiny stalks of a gazer are incredibly difficult to harvest undamaged, and the wands they create are just as fragile. They are best treated as weapons of last resort for a mage that is out of options. If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll `dice: 1d4\|avg|noform` (`1d4`). The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the gazer's statblock. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Minor Eye Stalk Wand.md\|Minor Eye Stalk Wand]] |
| 20 | Gazer Main Eye | **.** The main eye of a gazer is particularly useful when used in magic, despite its lack of utility for its original owner. Possessing a small fraction of its beholder-creator's power, it makes a useful spell component.<br /><br />**Use.** When casting the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell, you may expend this item instead of the usual material component. If you do so, your summoned familiar takes the form of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Gazer.md\|gazer]] instead of the usual choices. This gazer has all of the normal abilities of a familiar, as well as its normal abilities as a gazer. This gazer-familiar lasts until it either drops to 0 hit points or is dismissed. | 4 gp | 2 lb | â€” |
