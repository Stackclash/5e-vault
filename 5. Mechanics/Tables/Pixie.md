| 15 | Pixie Dust (small pouch) | **.** The ubiquitous dust dropped by the wings of pixies. Incredibly magical, yet volatile, it is virtually impossible for a non-pixie to determine what will happen when sprinkled on a creature.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may sprinkle some pixie dust on a creature next to you. If sprinkled on an unwilling creature, they may resist any resulting effect by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If sprinkled on a willing creature, or an unwilling creature that failed their saving throw, roll `dice: 1d10\|avg\|noform` (`1d10`) and consult the pixie dust effect table for the result. A small pouch of pixie dust has enough dust in it for 3 uses. | 3 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
