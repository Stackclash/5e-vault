| 10 | Yuan-Ti Blood (5 vials) | The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Poison Immunity.md\|Potion of Poison Immunity]] |
| 15 | Yuan-Ti Poison (vial) | **.** The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes in nature. The poison has been described by survivors as "like having one's blood transfigured into fire."<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d6\|avg\|noform` (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 120 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
