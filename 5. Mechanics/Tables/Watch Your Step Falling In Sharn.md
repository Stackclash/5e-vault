# Watch Your Step!; Falling in Sharn
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 152* 

**Falling in Sharn**

`dice: [[Watch Your Step Falling In Sharn.md#^falling-in-sharn]]`

| dice: d8 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | You fall hundreds of feet before striking the ground at the base of the towers. |
| 2 | You fall `3d6 × 10` feet before striking a bridge. A major bridge in an upper or a middle ward will have a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] enchantment; otherwise, it's going to be a hard landing. |
| 3 | You fall `2d4 × 10` feet and land in a passing skycoach, possibly injuring a passenger. |
| 4 | You fall `4d4 × 5` feet and strike an outcropping, flagpole, or projecting statue. If you survive, you're still precariously perched on the edge of a tower or bridge. |
| 5 | You fall past a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Hippogriff.md\|hippogriff]]—make a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check to catch its leg! |
| 6 | A [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Gargoyle.md\|gargoyle]] or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Owl.md\|giant owl]] catches you—then threatens to drop you if it doesn't get a reward. |
| 7 | You can fly! Actually, a nearby wizard or artificer casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] to save you, but for a moment it felt like you can fly. And now the spellcaster wants payment. |
| 8 | You strike a small [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Air Elemental.md\|air elemental]] that was drawn to the city. Doing this cushions your fall, but now you're on top of an air elemental. |
