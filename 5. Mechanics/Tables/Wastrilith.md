# Wastrilith
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 23* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Wastrilith Teeth (large bag) | Like a piranha, the mouth of a wastrilith is lined with row after row of thin, pointy teeth. Unlike piranha teeth however, wastrilith fangs contain a hair-like structure reminiscent of a whale's baleen. It is believed that this helps the wastrilith to filter through substances as it swims in its own polluted domains and then use what it collects to supply its own reserve of contaminants. As such, these teeth can actually be used as a filtration system, and have been known to be able to sieve through even magically tainted water sources. | 100 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Wastrilith Claw (×2) | Shaped like giant fishing hooks, the wastrilith's claws are capable of dragging adventurers down into the furthest depths of its watery domain. Formed from a lightweight but surprisingly strong cartilage, these claws make a very powerful yet easily handled weapon. | 140 gp | 15 lb | +2 Melee Slashing Weapon |
| 20 | Wastrilith Scales (large bag) | The scales of a wastrilith constantly ooze with a viscous mucus that is largely responsible for their infamous water corrupting ability. They are also incredibly hard and are comparable to the shells of dragon turtles in their durability. A suit of armor crafted from these scales allows an adventurer to sport the demonic protection of the wastrilith, but I would recommend wearing a thick doublet under it, unless you enjoy the feeling of slimy scales on your skin at all times. | 555 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Contagion Plate.md\|Contagion Plate]] |
| 25 | Wastrilith Bladder | Located inside the throat of the wastrilith is a watermelon-sized bladder that it uses to launch concentrated bursts of water at its foes. This organ is more than a mundane sack however, as it is also magical in nature; it is what grants the wastrilith its infernal control over the water around it. The bladder is delicate and easily damaged on removal, but a well-preserved sample can be used as a powerful magical item. | 2,000 gp | 15 lb | [[5.
