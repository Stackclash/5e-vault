| 10 | Drow Blood (3 vials) | Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Drow Lolth (MTF).md\|Lolth]], drow blood possesses some unique property that when re-brewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers. | 1 gp | 1 lb | Drow Poison |
