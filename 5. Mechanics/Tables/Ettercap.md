# Ettercap
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 44*

| 10 | Ettercap Poison (vial) | **.** Ettercaps secrete a noxious venom from their fangs that weakens any creature unfortunate enough to fall prey to it. By removing the poison gland, one can easily harvest some of this poison for their own use.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 3 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit by this weapon must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 4 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Web Gland | **.** Like a real spider, the ettercap is capable of dispensing web from glands housed in its abdomen. The gland is rather delicate once removed from its host, but the silk contained within is well regarded as a material for ropes and other items. Alternatively, it can just be lobbed at a foe to make a sticky explosion.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw the web gland up to 15 feet. Upon impact with the ground, the web gland explodes, forcing all creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] by webbing. As an action, the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] creature can make a DC 11 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. | 8 gp | 5 lb | — |
