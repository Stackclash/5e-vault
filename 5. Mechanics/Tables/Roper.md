*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 90* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Roper Saliva (vial) | A piercer continues to produce its horrible musk even as it grows into a full roper, except it now produces it from its stinking maw. It can still be turned into a perfume, even if the thought of doing so is unpleasant. | 5 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Roper Shell | The even harder and rougher exterior of a fully grown roper has many usages in Underdark culture. It is not uncommon to find many different pieces in an Underdark dwellers home crafted from these shells. | 10 gp | 60 lb | — |
| 15 | Roper Tendril (×6) | The trademark tendrils of the roper are still just as useful after removal from their body as before. Due to the roper's endless ability to reproduce these appendages, some Underdark societies actually raise live ropers specifically to take their tentacles as rope and crafting material. The resulting aesthetic of their ropework is disturbing to say the least. If you want to use them for the creation of a whip however, it requires a steady hand in order to not damage the fragile hairs that give it its debiliating qualities. | 10 gp | 25 lb | [[5.
