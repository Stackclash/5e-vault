| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Imp Venom (vial) | **.** The stinger of an imp can be surprisingly dangerous if one receives a full dose of the venom within.<br /><br />**Use.** Can coat up to 5 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 10 minutes. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d6\|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Imp Blood (vial) | **.** Imp blood is as thin and slippery as the devil it came from, but serves as an excellent spell component for lower-tier magic.<br /><br />**Use.** The next time you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell, you may consume a vial of imp blood instead of the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the imp familiar's statblock. Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar next disappears or is dismissed. | 10 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Imp Head | Imps are well known for their constant drone, incessantly gibbering promises of power and corruption to their so called "masters." In death however, their tendency to spy and spill secrets can be put to better use. An imp's severed head, along with some choice necromantic rituals and artificing can create a magical censer that alerts its owner to the presence of fiends in the vicinity. | 5 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Fiend Censer.md\|Fiend Censer]] |
