| 10 | Derro Brain | They say in the Underdark, "talk to four derros and you will find five psychoses." Indeed, the derro are among the more peculiar of the races to be found in the subterranean realm, and absolutely none of them have displayed behavior that could be considered "sane" by our standards. That is not to say that they are invalids, however. In fact, their so-called "madness" has served them well in keeping them alive in their hostile environment, really raising the question of what true madness even means. Either way, their eccentricities leads to their brains all being shaped differently, much like the unique patterns of a snowflake. For the more morbid academics, derro brains provide invaluable research into the nature of psychology, and thus can be sold for a tidy sum. | 5 sp | 2 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Mark of Diirinka | The derro god, Diirinka, is an odd entity, even among the greater pantheon of deities in the multiverse. First and foremost, it remains unclear if he even exists, or is simply another figment of the shared psychosis of the derro people. Regardless, his mark regularly appears in the form of a gray, black, and white spiral somewhere on the gifted derro that have been touched by Diirinka's magic. It is a simple enough task to take this mark and repurpose it for boons that channel his power...if he even exists at all. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
