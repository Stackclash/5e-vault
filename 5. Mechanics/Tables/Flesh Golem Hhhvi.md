| 10 | Golem Core | When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations. | 15 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Flesh Golem Meat | **.** The reanimation of deceased flesh into a golem's form permanently affects its structure and composition. The resulting meat is said to cause brief but violent outbursts in those that consume it.<br /><br />**Use.** If at least 1 pound of flesh golem meat is consumed, whether raw or cooked, the eater enters a berserker rage. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: eater] attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the eater attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. This effect lasts for 1 minute, or until a creature that the eater trusts succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to calm them. | 30 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 20 | Manual Ashes (small pouch) | The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of a manual of golem creation over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation. | 140 gp gp | 1 lb | [[5.
