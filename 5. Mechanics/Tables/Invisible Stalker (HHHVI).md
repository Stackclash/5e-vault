| 15 | Mote of Air | When an air elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clumps of dust that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 100 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elemental Gem Blue Sapphire.md\|Elemental Gem, Blue Sapphire]] |
| 20 | Stalker's Compass | When an invisible stalker is defeated before it can fulfill its mission, a single wisp of a breeze remains that futilely attempts to make its way to its quarry. If this wisp is captured quickly and prevented from further degradation, it will continue indefinitely attempting to reach its quarry. Resourceful trackers mix small amounts of dye into this container to make a makeshift compass that will lead them to whatever the invisible stalker was originally trying to hunt. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 10 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
