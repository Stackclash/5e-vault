| 15 | Enchanted Rubble (3 vials) | **.** When an eidolon forces its spirit into a sacred statue, it leaves behind a trace of its enchanted presence within the normally mundane stone. Although this presence dissipates over time, a keen-eyed harvester should be able to sift through the piles of dust of a destroyed statue and find the magical energies to keep for later use.<br /><br />**Note.** This item can only be harvested from a destroyed sacred statue that has been animated by an eidolon within the past hour. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may pack this rubble into a damaged stone structure. If you do so, this rubble melds into the structure, repairing any damage done to it, starting from the point where the rubble has been packed. One vial has enough rubble to fill in up to 5 cubic feet of missing material. | 200 gp | 3 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Guardian Spirit | The ever-zealous eidolon is created from the spirits of the most loyal and fanatical followers of a powerful entity. By agreeing to transformation into an eidolon, these souls agree to sever their right to the wheel of fate and a chance of entering the afterlife. As such, I would argue that since these poor souls have nowhere else to turn, harvesting their remains and putting them to work as new magical items isn't just morally justified, it would be what they actually want. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].** | 1,125 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Warden Charm.md\|Warden Charm]] |
