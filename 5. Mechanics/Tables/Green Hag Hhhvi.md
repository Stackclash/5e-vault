| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Green Hag Hair (small pouch) | The hair of a green hag flows like rotten reeds at the bottom of a swamp. While unpleasant to both observe and to hold, it possesses some weak magical properties and is often used by seedier alchemists looking for cheap substitutes for higher quality ingredients. | 1 gp | 4 lb | — |
| 10 | Hag Blood (3 vials) | Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease). It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Green Hag Skull | Green hags are notorious for their ability to mimic sounds to lure or scare intruders to their lairs. This ability lingers behind in their skulls and artificers can draw out this latent power to create a magical trinket with much of the same property. In several ways, the hag would probably have enjoyed the idea of its carcass being used for such a macabre activity. | 14 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Deception Skull Hhhvi.md\|Deception Skull]] |
| 20 | Hag Eyeball | **.** Not to be confused with the notorious "hag eye" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer `dice: 3d10\|avg` (`3d10`) psychic damage and are blinded for 24 hours. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
