# Vampire Spawn
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 104* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Vampire Spawn Fang (×2) | The fang of a vampire spawn cannot transform a victim into a vampire the way a full vampire can. They do however still possess some necrotic energy which can be transferred to a weapon crafted from them. | 60 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dagger Of Life Stealing (HHHVI).md\|Dagger of Life Stealing]] |
| 15 | Vampire Spawn Heart | The heart of a vampire spawn is a pitiful thing. More often than not, it is the heart of an innocent creature corrupted by a force more powerful than itself. Although it may have turned to evil in its undeath, the heart can still do good by being used to combat its dark master.<br /><br />**Use.** A vampire spawn heart that has had the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] cast on it once a day for 7 consecutive days, resonates with an energy counter to the darkness that once pervaded it. In this condition, a vampire spawn heart will attempt to warn anyone holding it of the approach of its old master. It will begin to beat slowly if the original vampire is within 300 feet of the holder, and beat progressively faster as the original vampire draws near. | Varies | 2 lb | — |
