| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Solar Ear (×2) | **.** A solar is known for its ability to hear lies whenever they are spoken. Their ears carry on this trait even in death and can be seen twitching when falsehood passes through them.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding two of these ears, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) ability checks to detect a lie being spoken. | 200 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Solar Blood (3 vials) | **.** The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this blood, you regain `dice: 8d8 + 4\|avg\|noform` (`8d8 + 4`) hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness. | 800 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Solar Wing (×2) | There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the silhouette of glorious white angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wings Of Flying.md\|wings of flying]]. | 700 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wings Of Flying.md\|Wings of Flying]] |
| 25 | Solar Eye (×2) | The burning gaze of a solar is capable of reducing even the strongest of evildoers to a smoking mass of flesh on the ground. Taking these eyes and performing extraordinarily powerful magic on them can transform them into diamonds that shine the same way they did under the solar's control. | 11,000 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Celestial Helm.md\|Celestial Helm]] |
