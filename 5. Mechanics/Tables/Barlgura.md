| 15 | Barlgura Hand (×2) | The enormous hands of a barlgura are capable of breaking a man in two with a single blow. The tough knucklebones make wonderful weapon components. | 20 gp | 33 lb | Any +1 melee bludgeoning weapon |
| 20 | Barlgura Bile (2 vials) | The rage of a barlgura is legendary even among the seething masses of demonkind. Such is their rage that their bile literally rises with their anger which in turn becomes a fantastic potion base for those seeking to emulate the ferocity of this demon. | 60 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
