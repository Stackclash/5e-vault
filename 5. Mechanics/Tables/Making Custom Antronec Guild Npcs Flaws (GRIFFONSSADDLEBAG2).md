| dice: d6 | Flaw |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I'm certain that people are plotting against me, making it difficult to trust others. |
| 2 | I've done horrible things to attain my position, and am plagued by my guilt. Should anyone uncover my deeds, I'd be ruined. |
| 3 | I can never work hard enough, fast enough, good enough to compete with my rival in the guild, and the frustration makes my temper short. |
| 4 | In pursuit of wealth, I take reckless risks I probably shouldn't, but can't resist. |
| 5 | I'm so focused upon my future ambitions and goals, that I'm blind to those I trample on my path forward. |
| 6 | My cutthroat business dealings have whittled away what few emotions and cares I had in the world, making me overwhelmingly cynical. |
