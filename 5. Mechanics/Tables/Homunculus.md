| 10 | Homunculus Material | The destroyed body of a homunculus returns to its mundane components upon its death. These components can be recycled into a new homunculus. | 40 gp | 6 lb | — |
| 20 | Homunculus Blood (vial) | **.** The homunculus' blood is the same as its master's: a wizard must bleed onto an empty construct in order to bring it to life. While this imparts a connection to that wizard that they would find useful, it can also be exploited by others skilled in the arcane arts who manage to capture said homunculus. As such, the price of this blood can vary wildly depending on which wizard's homunculus it was taken from. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may drink the homunculus blood. Doing so gives you all the knowledge that the homunculus had up to the point of its death, including the languages it knew, and the knowledge that its creator shared with it. You may not necessarily understand all of this knowledge, especially if it is of a very esoteric nature and you may not necessarily be able to parse all of it. You retain this knowledge for 10 minutes, after which all of it vanishes from your mind. Once this happens, you become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]] for 1 minute as your mind recovers from the influx of information it received. | Varies | 2 lb | — |
