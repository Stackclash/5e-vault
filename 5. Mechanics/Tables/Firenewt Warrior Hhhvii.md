| 10 | Firenewt Mucus (vial) | The sign of a healthy firenewt is a thin layer of mucus on their skin. This mucus smells of sulfur and other minerals that the firenewts come into regular contact with, but serves as a wonderful lubricant and insulation material. Tinkers are often glad to get their hands on samples of this to help maintain their mechanical inventions. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
