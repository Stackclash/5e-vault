# Gray Ooze
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 82*

| 10 | Gray Residue (vial) | Not as potent as a black pudding, but highly acidic nonetheless. Some blacksmithing techniques actually use this acid in advanced smithing projects, but the difficulty and volatility of controlling the residue has made this a rather esoteric art-form. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** A vial of gray residue can be poured on a piece of nonmagical metal. This ooze will eat through 2 inches of that metal every round for the next 10 rounds, after which it becomes too diluted to continue. | 7 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
