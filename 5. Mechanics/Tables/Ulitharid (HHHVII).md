| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Mind Flayer Mucus (vial) | The mucus secreted by a well fed mind flayer has a slightly sticky texture and smells roughly of weak formaldahyde. Filled with the thoughts and emotions of the mind flayer's meals, this mucus can undergo an alchemical process to turn into an intoxicating draught known as: Whisper. When consumed, the drinker experiences a rush of euphoria as dozens of minds recount lost knowledge and memories in a cascade of mental whispers. While unpleasant, this drink is considered a high honour in many Underdark societies. | 20 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Ulitharid Tentacle (×6) | The mouth tentacle of the mind flayer is renowned for affecting more than the physical on every lash. It retains this property beyond the death of its owner, and Underdark interrogators are rumored to use whips made of these tentacles in their work. | 25 gp | 7 gp | Mind Whip |
| 15 | Mind Flayer Heart | A mind flayer heart is a dark organ, filled with vile humours and thin ichors. When transformed into an amulet, it can grant many of the psionic abilities of an illithid, but at a terrible price. | 155 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of The Mind Flayer (HHHVI).md\|Amulet of the Mind Flayer]] |
| 20 | Ulitharid Brain | The brain of an ulitharid is larger and denser than that of a regular illithid. Within an ulitharid brain is the potential to grow into a formidable elder brain, much like how a caterpillar possesses the potential to grow into a butterfly (although in a much less pleasant way). As part of this, an ulitharid brain boats an engorged cerebrum and communication centers, which bolsters its telepathic abilities and enables it to serve as a portable psionic hub for its colony. | 375 gp | 9 lb | [[5.
