# Vine Blight
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 14* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Vines (small bundle) | The signature vines of the vine blight. These have been made sturdier yet more flexible in order to constitute the blight's body. When stripped down to their fibers, they make good material for rope and ties. | 5 cp | 5 lb | — |
| 10 | Blight Pollen (small pouch) | Unlike the needle blight which uses its pollen to communicate with other needle blights, the vine blight's pollen is capable of interacting directly with other plants, turning entire forests into dark defenders of the blight's domain. Despite that, their usage in alchemy is the same. | 3 sp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Speak With Plants (HHHVI).md\|Potion of Speak With Plants]] |
| 15 | Blight Seeds (×5) | The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them. These dry, wrinkled seeds sprout in a matter of hours and grow to maturity in days, forming the infamous vines, brambles, and weeds of a blight infestation. While most of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely with plant life. | 1 sp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Blight Oil (HHHVI).md\|Blight Oil]] |
| 20 | Gulthias Sap (vial) | The bodies of blights exhibit a strange property. When large quantities are mulched and then strained for some time, a few drops of a sticky, dark red sap sometimes drips out which more daring druids use in their rituals. | 6 sp | 1 lb | — |
