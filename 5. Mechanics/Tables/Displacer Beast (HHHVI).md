# Displacer Beast
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 32* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Displacer Beast Tentacle (Ã—2) | The prehensile tentacles of a displacer beast, tipped with spiked pads. While it takes the displacer beast's unique musculature to whip them with sufficient strength, they can still serve as strong whips in the hands of anyone else. | 10 gp | 18 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Weapon.md\|+1 Whip]] |
| 15 | Displacer Beast Blood (5 vials) | When the black, glittering blood of the displacer beast is dried into a paste and then mixed with magical ashes, pigments, and dusts, the resulting paint gains a strange property. Objects coated with this paint can only be described as elusive, as they pass under the notice of anybody who is not actively looking for them. | 12 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Obfuscation Pigments (HHHVI).md\|Obfuscation Pigments]] |
| 20 | Displacer Beast Hide | The hide of the displacer beast houses most of the magic that allows it to use its signature displacement ability. It is difficult to properly skin this magical creature without ruining the hide, but if done properly, the result can be used as the basis for the ever useful [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cloak Of Displacement.md\|cloak of displacement]]. | 200 gp | 25 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cloak Of Displacement.md\|Cloak of Displacement]] |
