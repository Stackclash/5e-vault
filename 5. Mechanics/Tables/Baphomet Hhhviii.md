| — | Baphomet's Head | One tale that I have heard whispered from the mouth of a dying cultist, was that Baphomet was not always a demon. In fact, Baphomet was once a fabled ranger known as "the King of Hunters." The King of Hunters was so skilled that he boasted even the gods themselves could not create a prey he could not kill. Angered by his arrogance, they set him a challenge: they would release the largest, wildest stag into a maddening maze, and he would not be permitted to leave until he had tracked and killed this divine quarry. He agreed to their terms and ventured into the maze, the gods waiting smugly by the entrance to listen for the signs of his failure. For five days, there was no sign of his return and the gods grew confident in their victory over this mere mortal. On the sixth day however, the King of Hunters limped into view, the bleeding head of the massive stag over his shoulders. Throwing it at the feet of the gods, the King of Hunters mocked them for their pathetic challenge and the supposedly weak creature they had created. Furious at both his victory and his scorn, the gods struck him down with a curse; removing his head and replacing it with that of the stag he had just slain. The anger he felt at their treachery transformed him into a demon and he was thrown into the Abyss where the gods would no longer have to face him again. From his new domain, the King of Hunters, renamed himself Baphomet, the Horned King, and subdue scores of demons under his control until he became a feared Demon Lord. Today, he waits for the chance to use his horns to gore the very gods that created them; as they are his ultimate quarry and he is their hunter. | — | 45 lb | [[5.
