| 5 | Mezzoloth Ichor (vial) | The ichor of a mezzoloth appears even more foul and dark than that of other yugoloths (if that is even possible). Like many yugoloth ichors, this ichor can be mixed with precious gem dust and oils to make an ink that passes on powerful magics. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to prepare a spell of at least 5th level, when you begin writing with this ink you subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cloudkill.md\|cloudkill]]. You may do this for a total of 10 hours, after which you successfully copy the spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Mezzoloth Gas (vial) | The gas of a mezzoloth is extraordinarily toxic and is said to have been the inspiration to whichever wizard invented the spell cloudkill. It will remain potent so long as it is kept in an enchanted vial, however it will dissipate much faster than a sample that came fresh from a living mezzoloth. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Once the vial is destroyed, the trapped gas expands rapidly to fill a 10 foot radius sphere. The gas acts like the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cloudkill.md\|cloudkill]] with the exception that it only lasts for 1 round and requires no creature's concentration to maintain it. | 60 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Mezzoloth Chitin | The dark chitin of a mezzoloth is harder than many metals and lends a distinctively insect-like appearance to an adventurer bold enough to wear it. | 85 gp | 70 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mezzoloth Mail (HHHVI).md\|Mezzoloth Mail]] |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Gem Of Teleportation (HHHVI).md\|Gem of Teleportation]] |
