| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Glabrezu Horn (×2) | The goat-like horn of a glabrezu. Does not contain much magical power in and of itself, but some demonologists do enjoy grinding it up for their rituals, or speak through it to lend credence to their voice. | 25 gp | 27 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Horn Of The Fiendish Voice Hhhvi.md\|Horn of the Fiendish Voice]] |
| 15 | Glabrezu Pincer | Resembling the claws of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Crab.md\|giant crab]], the glabrezu's pincers have a grip that can restrain even the strongest of creatures. Due to the glabrezu's natural fire resistance, resourceful blacksmiths repurpose these pincers as forging tools when working with magical flames. | 150 gp | 33 lb | — |
| 20 | Glabrezu Skin | The skin of a glabrezu is particularly tough and resistant to damage. If removed and treated properly, the resulting leather makes for a similarly tough set of leather armor (with a fierce aesthetic as a bonus). | 625 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Demon Leather Hhhvi.md\|Demon Leather]] |
