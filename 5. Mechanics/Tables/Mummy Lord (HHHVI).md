# Mummy Lord
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 77* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Mummy Bandage (small pouch) | The bandages of a mummy are marked with necromantic sigils and soaked in foul oils that curse a corpse with eternal undeath. While the magic can only be used on one corpse, the magical reagents can be recycled by resourceful alchemists. As such, these bandages can fetch a decent price. | 10 gp | 4 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Mummy Dust (small pouch) | The body of a cursed mummy remains cursed even after it has been rendered inanimate. Taking the dry dust from this corpse can serve as the basis for a ghastly potion once mixed with other oils and desert roots. Such a potion and fate should only be reserved for those who have committed the worst of crimes (such as making a mummy in the first place). | 15 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mummy Rot Juice (HHHVI).md\|Mummy Rot Juice]] |
| 20 | Mummy Lord Heart | The heart of a mummy lord is not actually found in a mummy lord's chest but is sequestered away in a separate container somewhere in the mummy lord's lair. It takes great skill to remove and store the shrivelled organ without damaging it, but if done correctly, can provide a powerful base for artificing. It is, however, advised that one finishes their business with the heart quickly, before its owner comes looking for it. | 4,500 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
