| 15 | Dybbuk Spirit | **.** The chaotic energy that constitutes the ethereal form of a dybbuk is notoriously difficult to pin down and must be done very quickly before is dissipates back into the Abyss. That same chaotic energy however, makes it very versatile and some tinkers have been known to use it as an animating force for their constructions, saying that it gives their creations a more lifelike spontaneity. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open over the intact corpse of a beast or humanoid within 5 feet of you that is size Large or smaller. If you do so, the spirit enters that corpse, animating it using the same rules as the dybbuk's *possess corpse* ability and with access to the dybbuk's *violate corpse* ability. The possessed corpse is loyal to you and follows your verbal commands, but is liable to twisting vague orders for malicious ends. This possession ends after 1 hour or when the possessed corpse's temporary hit points are lost, whichever comes first. Once the possession ends, or if this item was torn open with no viable corpses in range, the dybbuk spirit dissipates. | 80 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Haunted Figure.md\|Haunted Figure]] |
