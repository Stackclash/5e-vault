| 10 | Vegepygmy Frill | Due to their bizarre origins, vegepygmy physiology can vary widely from specimen to specimen. While some may closely resemble humanoids with soft grey skin, others may appear more monstrous with twisted appendages and bulging green orbs for eyes. That said, there is one attribute that they all share, which is their frill. Its exact location on the vegepygmy's body can vary widely, but it is responsible for producing the vegepygmy's spores, as well as regulating air and moisture intake. By itself it is not worth much, but dried versions of it are used in some medical schools as a treatment for respiratory problems. | 2 gp | 4 lb | — |
| 15 | Russet Mold Spores (5 vials) | **.** All vegepygmies grow out of a reddish brown spore called [[5. Mechanics/Traps Hazards/Russet Mold.md\|russet mold]]. As they grow older, their frills begin to produce this mold which accumulates around their body, waiting to be launched at unwary travelers.<br /><br />**Use.** This vial of spores is the equivalent of a square foot of [[5. Mechanics/Traps Hazards/Russet Mold.md\|russet mold]]. Refer to the [[5. Mechanics/Traps Hazards/Russet Mold.md\|russet mold]] tipbox in the vegepygmy's section to know more about [[5. Mechanics/Traps Hazards/Russet Mold.md\|russet mold's]] effects. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
