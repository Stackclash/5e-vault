| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Froghemoth Foam (5 vials) | The mucus-like coating that a froghemoth expels whenever it lays an egg contains a surprising amount of antibiotics and other healing properties. Most likely this was designed to keep bacteria and disease from infecting the otherwise uncared for egg. Regardless of its actual purpose, this foam makes an excellent base for the brewing of healing potions. | 10 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Superior Healing.md\|Potion of Superior Healing]] |
| 10 | Froghemoth Tentacle (×4) | The four long tentacles of a froghemoth are usually the last things that swamp dwellers see. Extremely strong along every point of articulation, the mucus produced along the tentacles also creates a mild adhesive that makes extricating oneself even more difficult. | 33 gp | 12 lb | [+2 Whip](compendium/items/2-weapon.md) |
| 15 | Froghemoth Eye (×3) | The eyestalks of a froghemoth are prehensile and have a surprising amount of acuity. With the application of a little electricity, they can become mobile again, allowing them to act as independent drones. | 77 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Eye Drone Hhhvii.md\|Eye Drone]] |
| 20 | Froghemoth Tongue | The tongue of a froghemoth is essentially the same as that of a smaller frog but on a much larger scale. While the lack of saliva production has resulted in the loss of its adhesive property, it maintains its extremely strong snapping action that allowed it to shoot forth and snag prey, as well as a surprising amount of prehensile control. Particularly crafty tinkers have realized how to transform this tongue into a ropey weapon attachment that can give melee weapons a little extra reach and control. | 500 gp | 12 lb | [[5.
