# Stone Cursed
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 67*

| 5 | Living Rubble (large bag) | The rubble created upon the death of a stone cursed is soaked in the magical traces of alchemy that animated the stone cursed in the first place. This rubble has use in cementing roads and building bridges as it demonstrates a certain amount of flex and expansion that would cause a regular stone to crack. In fact, it is not uncommon for an alchemist to earn some extra coin for the local government by collecting basilisk victims, turning them into stone cursed, and then quickly harvesting them for this precious material. | 1 gp | 30 lb | — |
| 10 | Petrifying Ichor (3 vials) | **.** Dripping from the stone cursed's hands is a thick grey goo that is capable of spreading its horrible petrifying curse to others upon entering a fresh wound. This goo is produced by the stone cursed itself, but is based off essences of both the basilisk and the cockatrice and combines elements from both of them.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying this ichor takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] until the end of its next turn, when it must repeat the saving throw. The effect ends if the second save is successful; otherwise the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#petrified\|petrified]] for 24 hours. | 2 gp | 2 lb | — |
