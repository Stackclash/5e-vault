# Yuan-Ti Abomination
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 109* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Yuan-Ti Blood (5 vials) | The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Poison Immunity (HHHVI).md\|Potion of Poison Immunity]] |
| 15 | Yuan-Ti Poison (vial) | The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes in nature. The poison has been described by survivors as "like having one's blood transfigured into fire."<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:3d6\|noform\|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 120 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Yuan-Ti Abomination Scales (large pouch) | A yuan-ti abomination wears no armor yet can deflect swords and maces with the strength of its scales alone. A few choice scales can be pried off following the abomination's death in order to make a shield imbued with the power of the serpent gods. | 600 gp | 14 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Serpent Shield (HHHVI).md\|Serpent Shield]] |
| 25 | Serpent Touched Heart | The heart of a yuan-ti abomination is one that has been specially blessed by the serpent gods the yuan-ti worship. Locked inside this heart is incredible divine power, but as befitting of the twisted worship the serpent gods demand, it can be passed on only through its consumption.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to eat this heart. When you do, you transform into a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Yuan Ti Abomination.md\|yuan-ti abomination]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Yuan Ti Malison Type 1.md\|...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: as described in the Monster Manual,] for the next hour. Your alignment remains the same and you retain any proficiencies you may have had originally. You do not get access to the weapons described in the yuan-ti abomination's statblock. At the end of the hour, or if you are forced prematurely back into your true form, there is a 10 percent chance that instead of transforming back to your original form, you transform into a form resembling that of a [Type 1 yuan-ti malison]] with a humanoid body but with a snake head. This effect is permanent and is considered your new true form. This effect can only be reversed with the power of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell. | 3,000 gp | 15 lb | — |
