**Environmental Effects**

`dice: [[Magical Effects Environmental Effects.md#^environmental-effects]]`

| dice: d8 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Healing spells are impeded here. Any spell that restores hit points does so as if it were cast at a level one lower than the spell slot expended. A spell cast using a 1st-level slot restores no hit points. |
| 2 | A character who casts a spell must make a Constitution saving throw against the character's own spell save DC. On a failed save, the character takes psychic damage equal to the spell's level and gains one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. |
| 3 | Any Medium humanoid that dies in the area reanimates as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Zombie.md\|zombie]] at the start of its next turn. The zombie is under the DM's control. |
| 4 | The area is affected by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Silence.md\|silence]] spell. |
| 5 | Each creature that enters the area is affected by an [enlarge/reduce](compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell, with an equal chance for each effect. The effect lasts until the creature leaves the area. |
| 6 | The pull of gravity is lessened. Creatures can jump twice the normal distance in any direction, and everything effectively weighs half its actual weight. |
| 7 | All creatures are linked to every other creature in the area as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Telepathy.md\|telepathy]] spell. |
| 8 | A creature that casts a spell of 1st level or higher in the area rolls on the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Wild Magic Surge.md\|Wild Magic Surge]] table in chapter 3 of the "Player's Handbook". |
