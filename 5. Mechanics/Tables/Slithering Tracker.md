| 10 | Slithering Tracker Slime (vial) | Although it greatly resembles water, the semi-liquid that constitutes a slithering tracker's form is a different substance entirely. Although it deteriorates rapidly once the tracker has been defeated, keeping it in an [[5.

Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 9 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Liquid Form.md\|Potion of Liquid Form]] |
| 15 | Echo of Vengeance | Even when they are defeated, a slithering tracker's lust for vengeance carries on. With a quick application of [[5.

Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].** | 30 gp | 1 lb | Curse of Vengance |
