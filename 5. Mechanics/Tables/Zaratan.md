# Zaratan
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 45* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 20 | Entropy Shard | Regardless of their end form, the creation of an elder elemental is an event so momentous that it breaks reality itself for a brief moment. This leads to the creation of an entropy shard: a piece of reality inside every elder elemental that they retain from their multiverse-shattering births. Resembling a pure white piece of glass about the size of a hand, this shard holds pure, primal power and should only be handled by the most experienced harvesters and crafters. | 4,000 gp | 5 lb | [[5.

| 25 | Zaratan Rubble (large bag) | Although the zaratan may seem like the definition of inactivity and dormancy, those that have met one can attest to the constant rumbling that occurs from it at all times, as if a great activity takes place within its shell. This is due to the unique, living minerals that constitutes the zaratan's body and defy the laws of physics by acting as force multipliers for everything around them. The result is a constant shifting of the rocks inside its form, like a circulatory system built from an avalanche. If you can find these special pieces of rubble after the zaratan's death, an artificer with expertise in elemental magic can harness it to create a weapon that contains literally limitless power. | 29,600 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
