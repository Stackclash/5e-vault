| 10 | Psionic Overflow | The star spawn are notorious for the way in which they interfere with minds of creatures native to the Material Plane. While research on them is sparse at best, it is widely believed that this phenomenon is due to the discordant resonance that their own minds constantly emit that is at odds with our own. Who knows? Perhaps on their own worlds, the star spawn are harmless and peaceful, only becoming violent and cruel when they interact with creatures like us that are incompatible with their own structure of reality. Further study is definitely needed on this topic, thus fueling demand for samples of the star spawn's inherent psychic energy. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].** | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Star Spawn Hulk Hide | The eerie, translucent hide of the star spawn hulk glistens like the refracted light of a far away star and yet, is as tough as twice-boiled leather. Indeed, little work needs to be done to transform this hide into a proper piece of armor. However, there are rumors that wearers of this armor begin acting a little...eccentric after a while, so probably best to take it off once in a while if you can. | 260 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Doublet Of Cosmic Protection (HHHVIII).md\|Doublet of Cosmic Protection]] |
| 20 | Star Spawn Hulk Brain | A star spawn hulk's brain is unlike anything found on the Material Plane. Instead of the soft, squishy gray matter that we would be familiar with, the brain of a star spawn hulk resembles a large opal, through which the light of the cosmos constantly gleams. This feature is most likely by design, as the hulk is used by its masters as an amplifier for their psionic barrages; any such attack on the hulk simply reflects off onto other creatures around them. The uses of such a resource are obvious for any crafter, but the structure of this organ is still so alien that many are afraid to work with it.<br /><br />**Use.** So long as you have this brain on your person, your thoughts and location can't be discerned by magic. In addition, if you take psychic damage, you may spend your reaction to force all creatures within 10 feet of you to make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, a creature receives an amount of psychic damage equal to the amount that you just received. | 875 gp | 7 lb | — |
