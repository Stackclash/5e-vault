# Raise Dead Random Effects
*Source: Deep Magic p. 351* 

`dice: [[Raise Dead Random Effects (KPDM).md#^effect]]`

| dice: d12 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Nimbus.** The target is surrounded by a glow or halo equivalent to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Faerie Fire.md\|faerie fire]]. |
| 2 | **Thundercrack.** When [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Dead.md\|raise dead]] is cast, the target's return to life is heralded by a crack of thunder and a stroke of lightning. These can be heard and seen for at least a mile and may be accompanied by a sudden, brief storm. |
| 3 | **Neophyte.** The raised creature forgets one language, one spell or feat, one friend, and one class ability. These memories return in a random sequence at a rate of one per week until all are recovered. |
| 4 | **Exhaustion.** Restoring a soul is as debilitating on the caster as on the dead. The caster suffers the same penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks as the raised creature. |
| 5 | **Voice of the Afterlife.** The raised creature gained subconscious knowledge of a distant plane during its sojourn in the realm of the dead. It now speaks either Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, Satarre, or Umbral (player's choice). |
| 6 | **Breath of Life.** The caster absorbs one magical disease, curse, or similar effect from the target creature into him- or herself. The affliction ends on the newly-raised creature but takes full effect on the caster, who must get it cured or removed by standard means. |
| 7 | **Gravetouched.** The raised creature has an uncanny voice or appearance that frightens nonhostile animals (including mounts), children, and even adults unaccustomed to such things. Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) checks are made with advantage. |
| 8 | **Raging Spirit.** The raised creature returns to life in the grip of intense and uncontrollable rage. It immediately attacks the caster and anyone else nearby, including friends, acolytes, etc. This anger ends when the creature becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] or when it's affected by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] or comparable magic. |
| 9 | **Mild Spirit.** The raised creature returns to life possessed of a gentle kindness. It refuses to fight, argue, or even defend itself for a period of `dice:1d6+1\|noform\|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) days. This unnatural calm can be removed by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] spell. It also ends if the creature is rendered [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] by an attack. |
| 1 | ** Altered Spirit.** The raised creature returns to life with a random alignment different from its previous one. This lasts for `dice:1d6+1\|noform\|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) days. The creature's alignment returns to normal if the creature is affected by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or if it's rendered [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] by an attack. |
| 1 | ** Armor of the Planes.** The raised creature gains resistance to necrotic, fire, cold, or lightning damage for seven days (caster's choice). |
| 1 | ** Servitor.** The raised creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by the caster. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, the creature serves the caster loyally as repayment for restoring him or her to life. The length of this service is determined by the caster's spellcasting level: up to level 11 = one week; level 12 to 14 = two weeks; level 15 or higher = one year. The effect is broken if the caster or the caster's companions cause direct harm to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature or its loved ones. |
