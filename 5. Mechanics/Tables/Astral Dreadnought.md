# Astral Dreadnought
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 9* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Plane Blocking Ichor (500 gallons) | The astral dreadnought is the apex predator of the Astral Plane and as such, has developed a multitide of biological features for hunting their prey relentlessly. One such feature is their blood which contains an enzyme that protects them from being banished from their own domain. If drained and stored properly, this blood can be repurposed into a paint that wards off anybody attempting to intrude upon your home via inter-planar means. | 2 gp | 5,000 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Planar Prevention Paint.md\|Planar Prevention Paint]] |
| 10 | Astral Dreadnought Tooth (×10) | An astral dreadnought's teeth is often the last thing an astral traveler will ever see. Even the smallest tooth is as large as a man's leg and is capable of piercing the hulls of the hardiest planar ships. These teeth make extremely powerful weapons once recrafted properly. | 60 gp | 25 lb | Any +3 Melee Weapon |
| 10 | Astral Dreadnought Spike (×6) | As if they were made from the worst sea creatures put together, the astral dreadnought's plated hide is covered in rows of vicious spikes reminiscent of a monstrous sea urchin. Repurposed into harpoons, these spikes are capable of felling most astral ships in a single shot. So my advice if you ever encounter a crew fierce enough to stock one of these? Run. | 100 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Astral Harpoon.md\|Astral Harpoon]] |
| 15 | Astral Dreadnought Claw (×2) | Like the claws of a gargantuan lobster, the astral dreadnought's claws are meant only for the crushing and destruction of its foes. Far too large to be wielded by an ordinary adventurer, these claws have found their use as rams installed on massive astral galleys and used to sink hapless travelers. | 650 gp | 400 lb | **.** **+3 Ram**<br /><br />> [!note]<br />> This is not an item, see the Galley's Naval Ram feature for more information. |
| 20 | Astral Dreadnought Crown Plate | Although the entirety of an astral dreadnought's hide is envied by armorers for its durability, only a select few scales on the top of its head has the flexibility and weight to be practical as an actual suit of armor. Reforged by master blacksmiths, this scale grants the wearer the same relentless durability as the titan it was taken from. | 1,500 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Of The Pursuer.md\|Plate of the Pursuer]] |
| 20 | Astral Dreadnought Scales (×20) | An astral dreadnought swims through the Astral Plane with the same majesty and grace as that of a blue whale through the ocean. This is aided by its scaly hide which is magically attuned to its home plane. If these scales are repurposed into hull plating, not only does it bolster the defenses of a ship, it also allows it to travel through the Astral Plane with all the ease of even the swiftest githyanki ships. | 75 gp | 50 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Astral Hull Plating.md\|Astral Hull Plating]] |
| 25 | Dimensional Gullet | While the gullet of most creatures leads from the mouth to the stomach, the astral dreadnought's has the much more unique and fantastical property of leading from its mouth to a self-contained pocket dimension. When properly extracted, the gullet can be repurposed by a highly skilled crafter into a cloak that can whisk its wearer away to the safety of their own pocket plane. | 8,000 gp | 60 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cloak Of Safe Harbor.md\|Cloak of Safe Harbor]] |
| 30 | Astral Dreadnought Eye | Much like the more ubiquitous [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Beholder.md\|beholder]], the lone eye of the astral dreadnought has the ability to shut down magical energy wherever it gazes. It is for this reason that some scholars have posited that the beholder and the astral dreadnought are somehow related; that perhaps the dreadnought was a mutation of a beholder by the goddess Tharizdun. Unfortunately, all attempts by these scholars to recover samples of the dreadnoughts to study have ended in...failure, to say the least. | 11,200 gp | 120 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Anti Magic Crystal.md\|Anti-Magic Crystal]] |
