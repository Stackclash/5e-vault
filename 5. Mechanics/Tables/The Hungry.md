# The Hungry
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 62* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Scouring Bile (3 vials) | **.** The hunger craves more than simply flesh, bone, and gristle to satiate their constant appetites. These sorrowsworn consume anything and everything; from intangible objects like the screams of their prey to even concepts like the fear of their victims. In order to digest such strange delicacies, the hunger uses a magical bile that is capable of scouring away virtually anything from what it touches. If diluted and stored properly, its more harmful aspects can be reduced and actually be repurposed for more medicinal uses. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may pour this bile on yourself, suffering `dice: 1d8\|avg|noform` (`1d8`) acid damage in the process. If you do so while suffering something that would allow you to end its effect by rolling a successful saving throw at some point, you may make that saving throw immediately, adding a bonus to your roll equal to the amount of acid damage you took. If you are suffering under multiple effects simultaneously, you may attempt to make a saving throw for all of them, making a separate roll for each one. Attempting a saving throw in this way does not prevent you from attempting again later when you normally would be able to. | 45 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Ravenous Maw | Capable of fitting an entire man's head inside of it, the yawning mouth of the hungry is a dark pit into which you should hope to never have to see. That said, if you are capable of slaying one of these sorrowsworn, their jawbone is incredibly useful as a weapon that literally hungers for the death of your enemies. Just be careful that it's ravenous influence does not spread to you. | 370 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Axe Of The Devourer.md\|Axe of the Devourer]] |
| 20 | Primal Hunger | **.** The sorrowsworn are beings of pure emotion, spawned from the collective psyche of the Shadowfell itself. After their corporeal forms have been slain, this emotion leaks back into its home plane, unless captured first by a harvester skilled with their [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]]. Whenever this emotion is released, it will then embody the closest creature to it, temporarily granting a myriad of abilities depending on the sorrowsworn. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the hunger inside to possess the nearest living creature for the next 10 minutes. Whenever a creature possessed by hunger sees a creature regain hit points, they gain advantage on their next melee weapon attack, and if that attack is successful, they deal an additional `dice: 2d10\|avg|noform` (`2d10`) necrotic damage. | 750 gp | 1 lb | — |
