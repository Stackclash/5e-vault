| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Ghast Blood (3 vials) | **.** This black tar-like substance resembles the coagulated blood found on murdered corpses. If you have the stomach for it, it can be rubbed on one's body to mask the presence radiated by all living beings that the undead can detect.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend 1 minute to cover yourself in ghast blood. If you do so, undead creatures with an Intelligence of less than 10 have disadvantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks to find you. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until the blood is washed off, whichever comes first. | 2 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Ghast Flesh | **.** The stench of a ghast is almost as debilitating as their touch. Nourished by and resembling decomposing meat, the flesh of a ghast can serve as a potent repellent in a pinch.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw the ghast flesh up to 20 feet away, the corpulent flesh bursting on impact. Any creature within 5 feet of the targetted point must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the effects of the ghast flesh and the ghast's stench feature for 24 hours. | 5 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Ghast Claws (×2) | The claws of the ghast are well known for their paralysing touch, and there are many a horror story of adventurers devoured alive by a ghast while they could do nothing but lie there helpless (of course one has to wonder how this story could be true if they are alive to tell it, but I digress.) | 10 gp | 6 lb | Paralysing Dust |
| 20 | Ghast Hide | Despite its undead nature, a ghast does not rot or decompose. While this only adds to its unnerving nature, its skin does have certain properties useful for a harvester. Some of the original designs for the renowned [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Colding.md\|bag of colding]] used ghast hide as its main material. | 40 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Colding.md\|Bag of Colding]] |
