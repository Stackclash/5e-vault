# Gorgon
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 60* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gorgon Oil (5 vials) | The naturally produced oil of the gorgon is a widely sought after lubricant. Crafters from all fields can find some use for it in their work and demand always exceeds supply. | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Gorgon Gas Sack<br /><br />(Only harvestable if the gorgon had its petrifying breath ability available upon death) | The gas gland of a gorgon, located just behind its nasal cavity. Resembles a balloon if it were made from metal foil. When harvested, can be given a good squeeze to produce the same petrifying effect its owner once used.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may squeeze the sack and release a petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]]. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effects ends on the target. On a failure, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]] until freed by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell or other magic. Once used, the sack is emptied and becomes useless. | 20 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Gorgon Hoof (×4) | The hooves of a gorgon resemble anvils more than anything else. It is ironic then that these are often reforged by blacksmiths on their own anvils. | 20 gp | 25 lb | +1 Greatclub, Maul or Warhammer |
| 20 | Gorgon Horn (×2) | It is hard to decide whether it is preferable to die by the hooves or the horn of a gorgon. Either way, a successfully harvested gorgon horn can be refined by any skilled blacksmith into a formidable weapon. | 20 gp | 20 lb | +1 Lance, Trident, War Pick, Javelin or Spear |
| 20 | Gorgon Plate | The iron-like armor plating of a gorgon is incredibly hard and yet is supple and breathes like skin. It is thus a unique and useful material for making fine armors. | 30 gp | 60 lb | Any +1 Heavy Armor or Shield |
