| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Ogre Fat (3 vials) | An ogre has a repugnant odor that seems to combine moldy cheese, sour feet, and dank mud all at once. The fat around their rotund bellies seem to be the most potent source of this smell, and it takes a very stalwart alchemist to render this fat into tallow to make a vaguely magical candle. | 1 gp | 1 lb | Repelling Candle |
| 10 | Ogre Hide | The tough skin of an ogre is undoubtedly smelly and unpleasant. However, when tanned, it makes for a very durable leather, and many would tanners would be glad to have them. | 2 gp | 30 lb | — |
| 15 | Ogre Hand (×2) | Brutish, rough, and very large, the hands of an ogre are meant for little more than wielding a club to smash those smaller than their owner. | 5 gp | 35 lb | Gauntlets of Ogre Power |
