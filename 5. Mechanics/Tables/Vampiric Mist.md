| 15 | Blood Mist (5 vials) | Like their tangible counterparts, the vampire mist is driven by an intense craving for blood. A mystery arises, however, in the fact that the vampire mist lacks any discernible organs with which to digest this blood; it simply absorbs it and leaves. This blood mixes with its misty form, creating a unique substance that has the life-extending properties of a vampire, but is also compatible with the humanoid circulatory system. As such, it is extremely useful as a base for creating potent healing potions and other medicines. | 9 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Greater Healing.md\|Potion of Greater Healing]] |
