# Flumph
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 47*

| 5 | Flumph Spray (vial) | **.** The flumph is mostly harmless and overall friendly. Even their self defense method is mostly harmless; an obnoxious smelling fluid that sends most other creatures scurrying away.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw the vial of flumph spray up to 20 feet away, shattering it on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the target location must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in a foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for `dice: 1d4\|avg|noform` (`1d4`) hours. The coated creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] as long as the stench lasts, and other creatures are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] while within 5 feet of the coated creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar. | 1 sp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Flumph Membrane | **.** The flumph is immune to any form of psionic or magical divination and telepathic probes. This is in part due to the thin membrane around its soft body that serves a similar function to the epiglottis in humanoids. This membrane prevents the flumph from psionically feeding on every creature around it, and is only turned off manually when the flumph is hungry. This membrane however does break down quickly with the death of the flumph.<br /><br />**Use.** While a creature is wearing the flumph membrane over their head, they are immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as all divination spells. The membrane loses this trait 24 hours after the death of its flumph. | 8 sp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mood Cap.md\|Mood Cap]] |
| 15 | Flumph Brain | The brain of the flumph is a powerful telepathic organ despite the overall appearance of the flumph itself. When rendered down and bolstered with psionically prone catalysts, the brain makes a potion that can provide the drinker with many of the same abilities. | 1 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
