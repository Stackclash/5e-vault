| dice: d10 | Adventure Hook |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | After a series of mysterious murders that seem to repeat a specific pattern from 50 years ago, the party hears about the Durheim Monastery's extensive Library of Life. Perhaps the insights there will aid in identifying the past and present killers. |
| 2 | An acquaintance of the party asks for help, explaining that they're being haunted by a vengeful ghost. They claim ignorance as to why they're being targeted, so only a thorough investigation will reveal the truth. |
| 3 | A lonely child speaks of an imaginary friend but is mocked by others for such a thing. A number of "accidents" are befalling those who dare speak ill of the child's companion. |
| 4 | The party is contracted by a retired adventurer who is being hunted by the spirits of every monster and villain they ever fought. |
| 5 | Several normally peaceful townsfolk are in jail for crimes they don't remember committing. The victims all seem to have links to the local nobility. |
| 6 | A piece of loot turns out to be a vessel for the spirit of a lost and scared child. Standard methods of releasing them fail, but maybe the experts at Durheim can help. |
| 7 | One of the party members crosses into the Border Ethereal, leaving the rest of the party to find a means of crossing and retrieving them. |
| 8 | A succession war is brewing, but all the evidence hinges on the spoken testimony of a baroness. A Durheim monk Walking the Liminal Path recommends the party visit the monastery and consult the records of one or more past rulers that are contained within. |
| 9 | Over the past few months, a prominent nobleman has been targeted by no less than fifteen assassination attempts by spectral assailants. No matter how grisly or public these incidents appear to be, the noble continues to go about his business the following day. |
| 10 | The local gravekeeper has vanished, and his old hound has begun to terrorize anyone that tries to approach the cemetery, despite being quite docile in the past. |
