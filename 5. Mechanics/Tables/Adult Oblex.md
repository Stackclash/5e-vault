| 5 | Oblex Slime (5 vials) | The slime of most oozes comprises little more than strings of proteins and acids that give them form and digestive capabilities. Oblexes are a little different however, as instead of simply digesting the body of its prey, an oblex also feeds on their mind and mental energies, thus necessitating a unique set of enzymes that react to the psionic field all creatures produce. These enzymes become mostly inert upon the oblex's death, but some Underdark societies have discovered fermentation techniques that can recycle the slime into an amnesia-inducing drink called "fade". This drink is famous for helping the imbiber forget bad memories; something you would probably want to do too if you lived in the horror that is the Underdark. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| **.** 10<br /><br />(See **Note**) | Dead Memory | **.** As the oblex consumes the body of its prey, it also absorbs their minds and memories. Where exactly these are stored is a mystery considering their lack of brain, but even without this knowledge, it is possible to extract these into a sheet of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]] following the oblex's death. For harvesting and crafting purposes, the specific individual's memories are unimportant. What we actually focus on is the lingering psionic resonance that they create as they call out within the confines of the oblex's nightmarish form. This energy is incredibly potent and is used by alchemists as the final catalyst for a particularly mindbending concoction. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Note.** You can repeat the harvesting check for this item and get a new harvestable every time until the first time it is unsuccessfully harvested. The DC for this item increases by 2 every time it is harvested, however. | 58 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of The Gestalt.md\|Potion of the Gestalt]] |
