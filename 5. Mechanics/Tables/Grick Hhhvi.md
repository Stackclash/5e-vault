| 10 | Grick Tentacle (×4) | The deadly tentacle of a grick is both rubbery and sharp. However, after prolonged tenderising, boiling, and seasoning, these tentacles make for a delicacy that several Underdark races have come to enjoy. It is usually served with a sauce reduced from the grick's own blood. It is an acquired taste to say the least. | 1 gp | 6 lb | — |
| 15 | Grick Hide | The skin of a grick has a unique shade and hue that allows it to blend into its rocky surroundings with ease. While difficult to remove properly from its rubbery carcass, the resulting hide makes for good camouflage clothes. | 10 gp | 18 lb | Grick Hide Cloak |
