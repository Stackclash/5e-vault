| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Shoosuva Fur (small pouch) | **.** Shoosuva fur falls in clumps from their bodies, like a dog afflicted with mange. It is not overly useful or attractive, but demonologists have found that the scent of this fur tends to make animals more aggressive and violent. Owners of underground gladiator pits have taken this information to spur their animal fighters to create more "entertaining" shows.<br /><br />**Use.** A beast that has an Intelligence score of 4 or less that smells this fur within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become berserk. While berserk, the beast spends each of its turns moving as close as it can to another creature and attacking it if possible. The beast remains berserk until it is either unconscious, 1 minute ends, or a creature that the beast is normally friendly with spends its action to make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check with a DC 15. On a success, the effect ends. A beast that has had the effect end, or who succeeds its initial saving throw, is immune to the effect of this item for 24 hours. | 35 gp | 2 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Shoosuva Spike | The bony protrusions along a shoosuva's spine are remarkably hard and sharp. These spines actually grow depending on how well fed a shoosuva is, and the strongest of them (and thus most able to hunt) have an intimidating frill of bone down their backs. | 52 gp | 13 lb | Any +2 melee piercing or slashing weapon |
| 15 | Shoosuva Heart | The heart of a shoosuva resembles that of a gnoll who has been "blessed" by Yeenoghu. Even when removed from its body, it occasionally beats when in the presence of fresh blood and meat. | 100 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Yeenoghus Boon Hhhvi.md\|Yeenoghu's Boon]] |
| 20 | Shoosuva Tail | The tail of a shoosuva is almost as powerful as that of a bone devil. Loaded with an insidious poison that leaves a victim helpless, it makes for a wonderful whip if the poison gland within can be harvested intact. | 285 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Yeenoghus Wrath Hhhvii.md\|Yeenoghu's Wrath]] |
