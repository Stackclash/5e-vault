# Annis Hag
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 26* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Annis Hag Hair (small pouch) | The hair of an annis hag clumps like moss upon a weathered boulder. Imbued with traces of the hag's corrupting magic, it almost feels like its growing and attaching itself to your hand when you hold it. | 6 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Corrupted Strength (HHHVII).md\|Potion of Corrupted Strength]] |
| 10 | Hag Blood (3 vials) | Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#Crone's%20Disease). It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Annis Hag Skull | An annis hag tends to have a number of iron teeth that it has embedded in its gums and magically fused to its own skull. This skull thus possesses strong magical power similar to the iron tokens that it hands to naïve children, and is thus able to be exploited by those with artificing knowledge. | 40 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Corruption Skull (HHHVII).md\|Corruption Skull]] |
| 20 | Hag Eyeball | Not to be confused with the notorious "hag eye" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer `dice:3d10\|noform\|avg` (`3d10`) psychic damage and are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] for 24 hours. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
