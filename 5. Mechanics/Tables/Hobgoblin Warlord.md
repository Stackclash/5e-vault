# Hobgoblin Warlord
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 65* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Hobgoblin Ear | The body of a hobgoblin holds little practical use for harvesters. Most cities however will pay small bounties for hobgoblin ears. | 2 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Hobgoblin War Braid | As a hobgoblin grows in experience and prestige, they grow out their hair into braids that are only ever cut if they lose a battle. These braids hold some value to collectors as well as bounty offices as proof of felling a noteworthy hobgoblin threat. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Mark of Maglubiyet | When a hobgoblin becomes powerful enough that they are considered a warlord, they receive a special mark to venerate themselves in the face of their deity: Maglubiyet. If skinned correctly and preserved, this mark can be taken by thaumaturges to craft a trinket imbued with the terrifying influence of the goblinoid god. | 5 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
