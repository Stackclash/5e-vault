# Basilisk
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 12* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Basilisk Tooth (small pouch) | As the basilisk feeds on stone, its teeth are infamous for being extraordinarily hard and sharp. Stonemasons across the land value these teeth as tools in their craft. | 2 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Basilisk Eye (×2) | The petrifying gaze of the basilisk is known far and wide. As such, the eyes of a basilisk are prized for their inherent magical properties and their use in the creation of petrifying tonics. It is said that more nefarious wizards make use of these eyes to create trapped statues that transform unwary intruders into stone. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Basilisk Gaze Poison (HHHVI).md\|Basilisk Gaze Poison]] |
| 15 | Basilisk Bile (2 vials) | It is a common misconception that basilisks digest stone. In fact, the fluids inside the basilisk's gullet transform consumed stone back into organic matter to be consumed. This bile is thus worth a good amount to alchemists seeking to make an oil to counter the effects of a basilisk's gaze. | 6 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
