# Star Spawn Seer
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 66* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Star Spawn Seer Tumor (large bag) | As a star spawn entity merges with a mortal body, it warps its form with horrible tumors and growths. This is due to the space-warping presence of the star spawn enacting its influence on a physical body. As such, the tumors themselves are extradimensional anomalies and are extremely useful as items for research into the stars and the mysteries of the multiverse. A curious quality of these tumors is that gathering enough of them in one spot tends to result in spatial anomalies around them such as random objects floating, distances not matching initial perceptions, and endlessly duplicated spaces, among others. | 1 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 10 | Psionic Overflow | The star spawn are notorious for the way in which they interfere with minds of creatures native to the Material Plane. While research on them is sparse at best, it is widely believed that this phenomenon is due to the discordant resonance that their own minds constantly emit that is at odds with our own. Who knows? Perhaps on their own worlds, the star spawn are harmless and peaceful, only becoming violent and cruel when they interact with creatures like us that are incompatible with their own structure of reality. Further study is definitely needed on this topic, thus fueling demand for samples of the star spawn's inherent psychic energy. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].** | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Star Spawn Seer Brain | The corrupted mind of a star spawn seer is almost unrecognizable from its original humanoid form. Instead of lobes and wrinkles, this brain seems to be more a random mass of writhing tentacles that attach themselves to the soft skull of the seer. These continue to move and twitch long after the seer's death and it is speculated by some that the brain is in fact the totality of the star spawn's physical form; that the star spawn entity is in fact more like a parasite inside the cranial cavity of its humanoid host. | 640 gp | 6 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Helm Of The Dark Reach.md\|Helm of the Dark Reach]] |
| 20 | Elder Star Fragment | Within a rare few star spawn is a small, durable shard that shines with the white light of an collapsing star. Extraordinarily difficult to work with, these fragments contain the power of celestial bodies themselves and can forge weapons that glitter with the maddening beauty of the distant cosmos. | 1,110 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
