| — | Zuggtmoy's Stem | Despite her nominally humanoid appearance, Zuggtmoy has one of the strengest physiologies of all demons I have ever encountered. Most of her mass seems to simply be co-operative colonies of fungal mass operating under a gestalt field of her soul. The only stable aspect of her is her stem, a cartilage-like rod that acts similar to a spine in a normal creature. This stem holds her true power and is said to be a shard of some alien artifact that fell to the Material Plane and grew into the Demon Lord we know today. | — | 10 lb | [[5.
