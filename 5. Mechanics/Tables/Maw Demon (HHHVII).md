# Maw Demon
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 15* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Maw Demon Teeth (large bag) | These jagged, uneven teeth are incredibly sharp and capable of rending meat from bone easier than a hot knife through butter. The nefarious magic in them make them wonderful materials for a morbidly amusing little trinket. | 1 gp | 7 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Portable Mouth (HHHVII).md\|Portable Mouth]] |
| 15 | Maw Demon Stomach | The unholy stomach of a maw demon actually doubles as a portal to the Abyss, usually leading directly to [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Yeenoghu (MPMM).md\|Yeenoghu's]] gullet. With only some slight alteration however, this stomach can be properly harvested and treated to act as a slightly different conduit for lesser demons.<br /><br />**Use.** If you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Summon Lesser Demons (XGE).md\|summon lesser demons]] spell, you may expend this item instead of its usual material component. If you do, the CR limits of the summoned demons specified in the spell are doubled. | 4 gp | 12 lb | â€” |
