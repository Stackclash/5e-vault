# Bulezau
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 20* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Bulezau Horn (×2) | Despite their solid appearance, the horns of a bulezau are actually spongiform in nature and are used to cultivate colonies of diseases and other pathogens. Once cleaned however, these horns may be repurposed as a fermentation aid, and in fact there are a few varieties of cheese and alcohol that owe their distinctive spicy flavor to this demonic instrument. | 12 gp | 3 lb | — |
| 15 | Bulezau Boil (×4) | The disease ridden bulezau is covered in a multitude of pulsating boils filled with infected pus. A mere whiff of the miasmas in these boils are enough to ruin the health of any but the hardiest of adventurer and thus must be picked extremely carefully by harvesters. If you can manage to bring them back to an alchemist intact however, they can be brewed into an incredibly deadly tincture.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw this item at a space within 20 feet of you, causing the boils inside to burst on impact. When you do so, all creatures within 30 feet of the item must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage. | 15 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 20 | Bulezau Tail | Anyone that has seen a bulezau in action can attest to the terrifying way that its tail flicks and swats at its enemies, spreading a horrifying disease to whomever it hits. This is largely attributable to the spines on the tail which are not only sharp, but are also hollow and filled with infectious contagions. With a few alchemical alterations however, these spines can be repurposed to actually draw diseases out of the user (so long as they can put up with the pain, that is). | 180 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
