| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lock of Fire Giant Hair | Resembling sparking embers, the hair of a fire giant is considered a valuable resource by blacksmiths. Striking the hairs creates a flame similar to a flint, while burning them creates a hotter flame than is achievable by most other fuels. | 55 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Fire Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the fire giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 185 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Fire Giant Strength.md\|Potion of Fire Giant Strength]] |
| 20 | Fire Giant Heart | Fire giants are known to literally have fire in their veins. One look at their hearts will make that obvious as they continue to spark and smoulder long after removal from their owner's body. Blacksmiths have long known how to transform these hearts into useful lamps. | 500 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Living Lamp.md\|Living Lamp]] |
