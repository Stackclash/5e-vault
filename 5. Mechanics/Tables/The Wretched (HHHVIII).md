# The Wretched
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 63* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | The Wretched Fangs (small bag) | The tiny fangs of the wretched resemble that of a leech in the way they latch onto their prey and refuse to let go. These teeth make supremely wonderful hooks, even if there is rarely anything to catch in the desolate wastes of the Shadowfell. | 2 sp | 6 lb | — |
| 15 | The Wretched Spirit | The wretched are exactly that; tiny horrors to behold and to fight. The trouble with fighting a pack of these comes not with their bite, but their simple-minded obsession with hunting their prey to the ends of the Shadowfell. While the thought of embodying this same spirit may seem unpleasant, it does grant the user the same stubbornness and wicked ruthlessness that these sorrowsworn possess. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the wretchedness inside to possess the nearest living creature for the next 10 minutes. A creature possessed by wretchedness may use their reaction to move up to half their speed whenever a hostile creature willingly moves away from them. This movement must be used to move themselves closer to that hostile creature. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
