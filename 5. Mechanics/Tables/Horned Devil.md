# Horned Devil
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 29* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Horned Devil Horn (×2) | The eponymous horns of the horned devil resemble those of an oversized goat. Extremely hard, they make striking trophies when mounted on one's mantle or displayed in a sacrilegious ritual; whichever is more appealing to you. | 25 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Horn Of The Fiendish Voice.md\|Horn of the Fiendish Voice]] |
| 15 | Horned Devil Blood (5 vials) | Horned devils are noticeably lazy and sluggish, especially for a creature as motivated as a devil. When their blood is mixed with other soporifics, it creates a tonic that can weaken the motivation of even the most stalwart creature. | 45 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Sloth.md\|Potion of Sloth]] |
| 20 | Horned Devil Tail | The tail of the horned devil ends in a vicious barb designed to open wounds and cause a victim to die a slow, painful death. If removed from the horned devil however, the tail can be repurposed into a vicious pike, spear, or whip. | 625 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wound Biter Weapon.md\|Wound Biter Weapon]] |
| 20 | Devil Wings (×2) | As the horned devil serves as the flying soldier for the armies of the Abyss, their wings are particularly strong and make good crafting material. | 400 gp | 25 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
