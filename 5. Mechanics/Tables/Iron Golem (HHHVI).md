# Iron Golem
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 58* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Golem Core | When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations. | 30 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Poison Canister | Inside an iron golem's chest cavity is a secret compartment lined with a slightly different iron alloy to the rest of the golem. This alloy reacts with oxygen to create a poisonous gas that the iron golem seemingly "breathes" at its enemies. If harvested correctly, it can be repaired by a skilled tinker into your own poisonous device. | 1,100 gp | 7 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Poison Lung (HHHVI).md\|Poison Lung]] |
| 20 | Iron Golem Iron | The metal used to craft an iron golem is leagues better than what you would find in an average alley blacksmith's shop. Taking this metal and resmelting it can craft some of the finest armor in the land. | 2,000 gp | Varies | +3 Plate Armor or +3 Shield |
| 20 | Manual Ashes (small pouch) | The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Manual Of Iron Golems.md\|manual of golem creation]] over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation. | 2,000 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Golem Companion (HHHVI).md\|Golem Companion]] |
