| 10 | Githzerai Brand | The githzerai practice many rituals in their constant adherence to discipline and tradition. One of these is a ritualistic branding of their bodies. Each brand may only be earned after the githzerai have demonstrated a mastery of a skill respected within the githzerai culture. Young and novice githzerai may only have a simple brand of a single skill, while the most revered and experienced in their society would have intricate brands, developed and layered on each other over their many years of learning. These brands are both rare and beautiful to admire, making them valuable to collectors elsewhere. | 20 gp | 1 lb | ℄ |
| 15 | Githzerai Heart | The githyanki are not originally a species native to Limbo, and yet they have made it their home regardless. Their existence there is a paradox; a stretch of serenity in an otherwise chaotic sea. This is reflected in their own bodies which have gradually adapted to living in such a place. Their hearts in particular are noteworthy to scholars trying to unlock the power of that plane. | 5 gp | 1 lb | ℄ |
| 20 | Githzerai Brain | **.** The githzerai brain is a marvel of biology. Capable of psionic output powerful enough to bend the normal laws of physics, it is noticeably larger and more developed than most other humanoid's. Although doing so may be distasteful for civilized folk, consuming the brain of a githzerai can temporarily boost the latent psionic powers of other humanoids, granting them similar abilities to its previous owner.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may consume the githzerai brain. For the next hour, you may cast the mage hand spell as a cantrip, as well as cast the feather fall spell up to 3 times. | 10 gp | 4 lb | ℄ |
