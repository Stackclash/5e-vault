| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gnome-made Servo | The internal mechanisms of the clockwork constructs can seem almost like magic for anyone not trained in the tinkering and gnomish sciences. While they may vary from model to model (and indeed, even among the same type of clockwork), they all share the same design for the core set of gears that power its lifelike movements. Tinkers of all breeds value these mastercrafted servos to use in their own creations, and will pay a decent price to avoid having to make them on their own. | 1 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Stone Shield (×2) | The master masonry of the stone defender's towering shields cannot be denied. Indeed, more often than not, an ambitious gnome will commission their dwarvish neighbors to ensure quality workmanship and sturdiness. Unfortunately, as is often found in the inventions of the zealous gnomes, they are also far too heavy and impractical to be wielded by an ordinary combatant into battle. As such, they are useful for little more than resale to other stonemasons as building material. | 15 gp | 40 lb | — |
| 20 | Copperstone Joint | The mere fact that a stone defender can lift its shields is an engineering marvel; the fact that it can swing them with enough force to knock down foes larger than itself is nothing short of a miracle. Indeed, the copperstone joint in the construct responsible for this is so intricate and advanced that it can almost seem to have been made through divine intervention. It is difficult to remove without damaging it, but if done so, it can be customized to give a weapon a very powerful follow through. | 100 gp | 15 lb | [[5.
