| 10 | Bearded Devil Blood (3 vials) | A bearded devil fights with a ferocity unmatched by any mortal. Even in the rare occurrences in which a bearded devil unit finds itself outnumbered, they continue to fight, never once breaking rank. If one takes their blood, distills it and mixes it into a draught, they too can share in the infamous bravery of these fiendish warriors. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Bravery (HHHVI).md\|Potion of Bravery]] |
| 15 | Clump of Beard Lashes | A disgrace to beards and bearded creatures around the multiverse. The lashes that extrude from the bearded devil's chin are tougher than oiled cords and covered with dozens of wicked barbs. Any weaponsmith worth their forge can craft these lashes into a particularly powerful flail. | 20 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Weapon.md\|+1 Flail]] |
| 20 | Beard Poison (vial) | Difficult to extricate from the diminutive glands hidden in the bearded devil's chin, this poison maintains its potency and is often used by assassins targetting magically talented individuals.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 40 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
