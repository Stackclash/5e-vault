# Nightwalker
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 54* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Nightwalker Horn (×2) | **.** The horns of a nightwalker act almost like an interplanar grounding rod. Within their semi-solid form lies ancient and forbidden magic that allows the nightwalker to remain in the Material Plane despite its paradoxical existence in our realm. When harvested properly, they can help keep any creature to keep a foothold in a realm they do not belong.<br /><br />**Use.** While you have this horn on your person, you have advantage on any saving throw to resist being sent to another plane or teleported against your will. | 260 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 15 | Nightwalker Doom Finger | **.** Very few creatures can boast the amount of power that the nightwalker carries in a single finger. Within this digit, the nightwalker is able to channel energy directly from its home plane, materializing in our reality as a beam of dark power that strikes a target with a small taste of what it is like to enter the destructive storms of the Negative Plane. It is extraordinarily dangerous to attempt to harvest or craft with this appendage, yet if you can successfully do both, you will possess a wand that channels the force of anti-life itself.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding this finger, you may use your action to point it at a target you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 4d12\|avg\|noform` (`4d12`) necrotic damage and become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of your next turn. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] in this way, the creature is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]]. Once used, this item cannot be used again until the next dawn. In addition, every time you use this item, there is a 90% chance chance that it will explode into a burst of anti-matter instead. If this occurs, the finger is destroyed and all creatures within 60 feet of you must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, suffering `dice: 4d6\|avg\|noform` (`4d6`) necrotic damage and becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] until the start of your next turn on a failure, or half that and no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralysis]] on a success. | 2,260 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of Doom.md\|Wand of Doom]] |
| 20 | Negative Plane Echo | **.** Most of a nightwalker's semi-corporeal body appears to be formed from a wispy shadow substance that congels, flickers, and dissipates repeatedly in a maddening dance. This shadow is actually pure Negative Plane energy and only appears the way it does due to our limited senses. Most of this energy dissipates soon after the nightwalker's death, but quick hands can harvest some of it into [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]] to later be transferred into a more solid vessel capable of utilizing the nullifying abilities of Negative Plane energy. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the pent up energy inside and forcing all creatures within 60 feet of you must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, suffering `dice: 6d6\|avg\|noform` (`6d6`) necrotic damage and becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] until the start of your next turn on a failure, or half that and no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralysis]] on a success. | 4,600 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Armor Of Nullification.md\|Armor of Nullification]] |
| 25 | Anti-Heart | **.** There is a great amount of debate as to whether nightwalkers exist naturally in the Negative Plane, or if they only come into being when a creature from the Material Plane crosses the threshold into that nightmarish realm. Supporters of the latter theory hold up the nightwalker's "anti-heart" as evidence to support their claim. This antiheart appears to us as a dark, flame-like mote of negative energy nestled in the nightwalker's chest. The origin of its name is the fact that this organ seems to be diametrically linked to the trapped creature that released the nightwalker in the first place, shifting in unison with their own heartbeat and becoming stronger as the trapped creature grows weaker. Like all aspects of the nightwalker, the anti-heart exists only as a dark inversion of life and thus has powerful destructive and life-nullifying properties.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding onto this heart, you may use your action to communicate with the creature whose entrapment in the Negative Plane spawned the nightwalker. You are able to send a verbal message to that creature from any plane and they may respond in kind but are under no obligation to do so. If that creature dies, this item loses its ability, indicated by the anti-heart becoming noticeably inert and lacking the flame-like wisps that usually surround it. | 12,000 gp | 5 lb | [[5.
