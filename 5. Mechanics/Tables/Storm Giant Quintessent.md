| 15 | Mote of Storm Giant (vial) | A storm giant quintessent lacks a stable physical form and is instead dispersed into the atmosphere around them, swirling as a literal force of nature. That said, much of their essence can be found distilled into a single mote of weather. Sometimes this takes the form of sparkling rain drops, a breeze that carries a whisper of the giant's name, or a snowflake with a particularly striking pattern. This mote carries much of the original storm giant's power and is thus a good substitute for their physical remains when used in alchemical pursuits. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 150 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Storm Giant Strength.md\|Potion of Storm Giant Strength]] |
| 20 | Storm Giant Quintessent Water (vial) | A storm giant quintessent is capable of forming parts of its own raging storm into weapons for use in combat. To do this, it must impart the ambient atmosphere with the same sense of physicality and stability that it has used on itself to maintain a recognisable giant shape. Once the quintessent is defeated, some of this imparted power remains in their dispersed weapons, which can then be hastily collected for use in powerful alchemy later on. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 2,800 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Flask Of Storms.md\|Flask of Storms]] |
| 25 | Storm Giant Spirit | Although its form has been dispersed to the atmosphere around it, the spirit of a storm giant quintessent rages on stronger than ever. If its physical form is ever dissipated, their physically untethered spirit can be imprinted onto a piece of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]] which can later be transferred to a powerful cloak. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].** | 11,500 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
