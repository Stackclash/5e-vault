|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| 2 | 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Displacer Beast.md\|displacer beast]] |
| 3 | 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gnoll Pack Lord.md\|gnoll pack lord]] and `dice: 2d4\|avg` (`2d4`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gnoll.md\|gnolls]] |

Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gnoll.md\|gnoll]] tracks. Following the tracks for `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) hours leads to an encounter with [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gnoll.md\|gnolls]], or the discovery of dead [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gnoll.md\|gnolls]] with elven arrows sticking out of their flea-ridden corpses. |
| 6 | 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Owl.md\|giant owl]] |

If the horn is blown within the forest, roll on this table again. If the result indicates a monster encounter, the indicated monster or monsters arrive in `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) minutes. New arrivals other than [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gnoll.md\|gnolls]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Hyena.md\|hyenas]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Owlbear.md\|owlbears]], and [[5.

Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible\|invisible]] for 1 hour, or until it attacks or casts a spell. Once picked, a berry loses its magic after 12 hours. Berries regrow at midnight, but if all its berries are picked, the plant becomes nonmagical and grows no more berries. |
| 16 | An elven tune carried on a gentle breeze |
| 17 | `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Faerie Dragon Orange.md\|orange]] (75%) or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Faerie Dragon Blue.md\|blue]] (25%) faerie dragons |
| 18 | 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Druid.md\|druid]] (elf). The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Druid.md\|druid]] is initially indifferent toward the party but becomes friendly if the characters agree to rid the forest of its gnoll infestation. |
| 19 | 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Treant.md\|treant]]. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Treant.md\|treant]] is friendly if the party includes one or more elves or is accompanied by a visible fey creature. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Treant.md\|treant]] is hostile if the characters are carrying open flames. Otherwise, it is indifferent and doesn't announce its presence as the characters pass by. |
| 20 | 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Unicorn.md\|unicorn]] |
