| 10 | Flameskull Ashes (small pouch) | After a flameskull is destroyed, the magical flames that surrounded it leave behind an ashy residue around the skull. These ashes contain "memories" of the magic that the flameskull knew in life, and may be used as a special pigment for wizards trying to expand their spellbook.<br /><br />**Use.** A character may add any spell available to the flameskull to their own spellbook as if they had found the spell in a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spell Scroll (DMG).md\|spell scroll]] or similar. Doing so follows the same rules as the copying a spell into the book rules on page 114 of the Player's Handbook, using the flameskull ashes instead of ink. The character may deduct the cost of the flameskull ashes from the overall cost of copying the spell. | 20 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Flameskull | A flameskull is a cursed creature, an echo of the brilliance it had in its mortal life. Even after the skull has been defeated and its essence cleansed, the physical skull still contains traces of the magic it once had. If you are willing to further disgrace the wizard that the skull came from, a few choice runes and inlays on the skull can bring out this magic to your own advantage. | 60 gp | 6 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Skull Of Revelation (HHHVI).md\|Skull of Revelation]] |

> [!note] Copying a Spell into the Book
> 
> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
> 
> Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
> 
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
> 
> **Copying from a Spell Scroll.** A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
