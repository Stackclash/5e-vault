| 10 | Summer Blood (3 vials) | **.** The blood of an eladrin in its summer form smells like cinnamon and seems to remain warm and fluid even long after the death of its original owner. Creatures of the Feywild that pledge themselves to the eladrin have been found wearing war paint that has been made from pigments and droplets of summer blood which is said to enhance the aggression and combat ability of the user.<br /><br />**Use.** You may drink this vial of blood as an action. If you do so, for the next hour, you are immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|fear]] condition. | 60 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Eladrin Heart | The emotions of an eladrin are more intense and passionate than most mortals could ever comprehend. In fact, from my interviews with the eladrin, I could only describe their feelings as the most pure expression of emotion capable, one untainted by mundane desires and influences. These feelings are so strong that they are even capable of altering the eladrin's physical form and are kept (where else): the heart. If you want to tap into such a primal force, you must be prepared to remove the heart of these creatures, perhaps in doing so, proving why you need an emotional aid in the first place. | 540 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
