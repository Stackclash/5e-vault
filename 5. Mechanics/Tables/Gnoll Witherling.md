# Gnoll Witherling
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 23* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Witherling Dust (small pouch) | A gnoll skeleton that has been transformed into a witherling is much the same as any other. However, prolonged exposure to the elements can cause them to gain a unique layer of dust the consistency (and smell) of extremely aged cheese. While this dust is not overtly magical, it is very useful as pounce for drying the mystical inks that fiendish cults use when scribing their dark tomes and scrolls. Needless to say, this product has a very niche market. | 8 cp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Gnoll Tooth (small pouch) | The sharp, irregular teeth of a gnoll. Not worth much other than as a trophy. Harvesters are advised to wash them at the first chance, as they carry the stench of a gnoll's mouth long after removal. | 1 sp | 1 lb | — |
