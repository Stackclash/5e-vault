| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Slaad Slime (vial) | The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers. | 3 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Slaad Heart | **.** Slaadi are creatures of pure chaos, born from the unstable energies in Limbo. As such, their very bodies disrupt the natural order of things and those that consume some of their flesh tend to find that probability itself changes for them, if only temporarily. Beware however, as the universe is not to be trifled with, and it tends to find ways to balance itself out later.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may eat this item. If you do so, then once within the next 10 minutes you may choose to bend the laws of fate within your favour. If you do so, you gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If you choose not to, this item is wasted. After those 10 minutes have passed, your DM may choose at any time within the next 24 hours to impose disadvantage on 1 attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make. | 30 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Green Slaad Claw | **.** Only one of a green slaad's claws have much value; the one it used to cast spells with before it became a slaad. This claw is suffused with both the magic of its old life as well as the chaotic energies of Limbo. As such, it grants its wielder incredible, if unreliable, power.<br /><br />**Use.** This claw may be used as an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Arcane Focus.md\|arcane focus]]. If you do so, when a creature you can see is forced to roll a saving throw due to a spell you cast, you may force that creature to roll at disadvantage. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Wild Magic Surge.md\|Wild Magic Surge]] table in the "Player's Handbook" immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this ability. | 150 gp | 12 lb | — |
