# Purple Worm
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 87* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Purple Worm Blood (9 vials) | It is a simple fact of Underdark life that you need to have a purple worm ward if you wish to have a long-term settlement. Ironically, these wards require the blood of a purple worm in order to be created. In a way, though it is fitting that only a society that can kill a purple worm can be protected from them. Natural selection at its finest, as it were. | 130 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Purple Worm Bile (3 vials) | **.** The incredibly corrosive bile of a purple worm is coveted by miners for being able to literally eat through rocks that would otherwise take weeks of work to break through. Just be careful when harvesting it, however, you don't want to be known as the fool who was eaten by an already slain purple worm.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw a vial of purple worm bile at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers `dice: 5d6\|avg|noform` (`5d6`) acid damage. | 150 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Purple Worm Tooth (×4) | Purple worm teeth resemble stalactites and stalagmites in their cavernous mouth more than anything else. Larger than a grown human's arm, these teeth make very good crafting materials and are a rich source of ivory. Alternatively, they can be crafted into fine weapons. | 150 gp | 30 lb | Any +2 melee piercing weapon |
| 20 | Purple Worm Stinger | Despite what you may think, it is not much safer to be on the opposite side of a purple worm's mouth, as its tail is perhaps even more deadly. When the stinger head is taken and re-crafted into a weapon, it can deliver payloads of venom just as it did when attached to its original owner. | 2,200 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Purple Piercer.md\|Purple Piercer]] |
| 25 | Purple Worm Pearl | With all the dirt and rock that a purple worm chews through, it inevitably swallows some precious gems and metals. These are not digested easily and often clump together in the purple worm's stomach. Melded together by digestive acids and pressure, they form beautiful unique pearls that fetch incredibly high prices on open markets. | 5,000 gp | 10 lb | — |
