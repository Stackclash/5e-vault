| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Golem Core | When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations. | 20 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Clay Golem Clay | While a defeated clay golem loses much of its magical properties, it maintains a supernatural durability above that of regular clay. Re-sculpting this into other forms can create a very formidable weapon or armor. | 150 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Clay Weapon Hhhvi.md\|Clay Weapon]] |
| 20 | Manual Ashes (small pouch) | The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of a manual of golem creation over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation. | 500 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
