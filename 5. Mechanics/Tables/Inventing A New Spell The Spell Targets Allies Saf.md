**The Spell Targets Allies**

| dice: d8 | Spell Effect |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Dexterous:** For 10 minutes, the targets' movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. |
| 2 | **Accelerating:** For 10 minutes, before taking an action, the targets can move an extra half of their movement. |
| 3 | **Energizing:** Until the start of their next turn, the target adds your spellcasting modifier to their attack rolls and spellcasting DC. |
| 4 | **Oracular:** For 10 minutes, the target can see which items within 60 feet are magical, can see the effects of persistent spells, and can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to know exactly what those items or spells are. |
| 5 | **Fated:** Until the start of their next turn, targets may reroll damage rolls and may take the new roll. |
| 6 | **Vengeful:** For 10 minutes, targets gain a reaction they may use to attack any enemies who damage them. |
| 7 | **Revealing:** Until the start of their next turn, targets always roll natural 20s on Perception checks. |
| 8 | **Gloating:** For 10 minutes, any target who drops an enemy to 0 hit points gains a move action or attack action. |
