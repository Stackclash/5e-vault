| 15 | Spectator Eye Stalk | **.** The stalks of the spectator are less powerful than those of the beholder it consumed to be summoned. However, their potential to be made into wands by artificers are the same. When crafted properly, they continue to contain an arcane charge that allows them to discharge the same types of magical rays they did in life.<br /><br />If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d4. The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the spectator statblock. | 14 gp | 7 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Spectator Main Eye | The main eye of the spectator functions differently to that of the beholder. While the beholder's emits an anti-magic cone at all times, the spectator's can be used to reflect poorly casted spells at other targets. When used for crafting, the magic of the eye can be transferred over to a shield, to grant it the same ability. | 60 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
