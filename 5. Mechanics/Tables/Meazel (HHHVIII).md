# Meazel
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 52* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 5 | Meazel Hair (small bag) | The meazel's body is covered with wispy tufts of black hair that flows and flutters like the edges of a shadow. Surprisingly soft for such a rough-natured creature, this hair is favored in lining leather armor for both its sound dampening and light absorbing properties. | 5 sp | 3 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Umbra Ichor (3 vials) | The thin liquid that flows through a meazel's veins acts similarly to blood, but is in fact concentrated shadow magic that has infused itself into the meazel's body. It is this substance that causes shadows to recognize the meazel as its own, allowing the wily creatures to slip in and out of them at will. When drunk by any other creature, it grants these same benefits, but be careful about taking it regularly; it can lead to overwhelming feelings of malaise and emptiness if one's intake is not managed properly.<br /><br />**Use.** You may drink this ichor as an action. For the next hour, you have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet and you can take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action as a bonus action while in dim light or darkness. During this time however, you also gain a sensitivity to sunlight and have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
