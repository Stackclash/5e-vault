# Salamander
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 92* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Salamander Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a salamander continues to boil with a furious energy long after the salamander's death. Smiths around the world value samples of this blood as a potent fuel source for their forges that allow them to smelt metals that they could not otherwise. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Salamander Fire (HHHVI).md\|Salamander Fire]] |
| 10 | Salamander Fang | Even though they now have arms to wield weapons, a salamander could very easily still use its formidable bite to kill its foes. Their fangs in particular radiate a deadly heat that can be transferred to a knife when recrafted. | 20 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Fire Dagger (HHHVI).md\|Fire Dagger]] |
| 15 | Salamander Scale (large pouch) | Salamander scales stay supernaturally warm even after removal from their body. It is not uncommon for wealthy merchants to have winter beds lined with these scales to keep them comfortable in the colder months. As a fully grown adult, a salamander's scales are more than hard enough to use them for a protective shield. | 65 gp | 18 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cinder Shield (HHHVI).md\|Cinder Shield]] |
