# Nalfeshnee
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 25* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Nalfeshnee Teeth (small pouch) | While they may be yellow and stained from centuries of poor hygiene, the teeth of a nalfeshnee are still made of a high quality ivory that surpasses those found in mortals. They may be made into a variety of things, but the nalfeshnee's glutton nature lends them well to being made into cutlery. | 30 gp | 4 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Glutton Cutlery (HHHVI).md\|Glutton Cutlery]] |
| 10 | Nalfeshnee Tusk (×2) | Heavy and thick, much like the nalfeshnee itself. Make a weapon from these tusks and you can gore your enemies with all the strength of the Abyss. | 150 gp | 18 lb | Any +2 piercing weapon |
| 15 | Nalfeshnee Wing (×2) | The almost comically small wings of a nalfeshnee do not function on actual physics to support its large weight, but rather sophisticated space displacement magic that belies the nalfeshnee's brutish appearance. These wings are also responsible for the nalfeshnee's ability to teleport, something that can be taken advantage of by a skilled harvester.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action focusing on a wing in your hand. If you do so, you magically teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once this item has been used once, it loses all magical properties and becomes useless. | 350 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 20 | Nalfeshnee Eyes (×2) | Nalfeshnees are full of surprises that hide behind their otherwise savage looking appearance. The most dangerous of these are their eyes which are capable of producing a horrifyingly captivating light that destroys the wills of any unlucky enough to see it. With good artificing, these eyes can be transformed into gems to give off a similar performance. | 800 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Demon Light (HHHVI).md\|Demon Light]] |
