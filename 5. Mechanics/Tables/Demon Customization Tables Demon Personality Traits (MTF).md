| dice: d6 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I enjoy telling lies. |
| 2 | Threats are my only language. |
| 3 | I fawn over others to make my betrayal more unexpected. |
| 4 | I crush those I can defeat, and lie in wait to weaken and overwhelm those I must respect. |
| 5 | I will do anything to survive. Anything. |
| 6 | Someday all will worship me. Until then, I track their insults with obsessive attention. |
