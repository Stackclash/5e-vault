| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Barbed Devil Barb (Ã—10) | Touching a barbed devil is like sleeping in a bed of porcupines. Incredibly sharp and durable, these barbs sometimes find a second use as nails in the crafting of particular sets of armor and equipment. Otherwise they serve as building material for sturdy arrows and bolts. | 1 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Ammunition.md\|+1 Bolt]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Ammunition.md\|+1 Arrow]] |
| 15 | Barbed Hide | Barbed devils fight with a frenzy unmatched by many mortal creatures. As such, by the time you finish hunting them, their carcass is so damaged that their hide becomes effectively useless. If you manage to skin one properly however, the hide can be treated, tanned, and turned into a cloak that is perfect for deterring anyone who thinks that hugging is an acceptable form of greeting. | 30 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Barbed Cloak.md\|Barbed Cloak]] |
| 20 | Barbed Devil Blood (3 vials) | Despite their name, barbed devils harbour just as much proclivity for employing fire magic as they do their barbs. The fire is literally in their blood, and with proper alchemy, it can be in yours too. | 14 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Fire Resistance.md\|Potion of Fire Resistance]] |
| 25 | Barbed Devil Tail | The barbed devil's tail is even deadlier than its razor sharp claws, and when swung at full force is said to crumple plate armor and pierce the flesh beneath. Thankfully, there is nothing stopping anyone else from taking this tail, crafting it into a whip, and using it for their own purposes. | 150 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Weapon.md\|+1 Whip]] |
