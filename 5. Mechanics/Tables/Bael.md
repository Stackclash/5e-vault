| — | Twin Horns of Bael | The horns of Bael are actually relatively understated for something that adorns the head of one of the Nine Hells' most dangerous inhabitants. Ridged cones that resemble that of a massive steer, these horns actually contain most of the archdevils' strength. Many fiendish cults have dedicated themselves to creating facsimiles of these horns atop their armor, but there is no substitue for actually harvesting them and affixing them on your helm to steal the fiend's hellish strength. | — | 30 lb | [[5.
