| 10 | Vargouille Jaw | The infamous curse of a vargouille is purely magical in nature and unfortunately cannot be traced back to any biological component for harvesting. That said, since their jaws act as the vector of the curse, they often become infused with trace elements of this Abyssal power and thus hold some utility for crafting fiendish (if ultimately harmless) items. | 1 gp | 7 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Vargouille Wing (×2) | **.** Formed from the ears of the vargouille's original body, these wings are surprisingly powerful and seem to move independently on the vargouille's manic body. If sliced off quickly after the vargouille's defeat and then pinned with cold iron tacks, they maintain a semblance of magic that allows them to be reused elsewhere.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend your action to pin these wings onto an easily pierceable object that weighs no more than 10 pounds. Once you do so, that object gains a low level of sentience that allows it to follow you around for 1 hour. The object has a fly speed of 10 feet and always attempts to take the most direct path to you, so long as you are within 60 feet of it. If you move farther than 60 feet away, or if there is an impassible object directly between you and the object, the object lands on the ground until you move within 60 feet again, or the path to you becomes clear. At the end of the hour, the wings on the object dissolve into a black ichor, and the object falls to the ground. | 4 gp | 4 lb | — |
