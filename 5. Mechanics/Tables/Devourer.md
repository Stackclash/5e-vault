# Devourer
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 16* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lesser Demon Essence | **.** Like the tinder that sparks a fire, the soul of a lesser demon is consumed to animate the devourer. While this soul is mostly lost after being fed to the devourer, shreds of its essence can be captured in [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]] to be used for demonic rituals. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** If you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Summon Lesser Demons.md\|summon lesser demons]] spell, you may use this item in place of the usual material component. This item is not consumed upon its usage and may be reused indefinitely. | 100 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Devourer Claw (×2) | The rending claws of a devourer can tear through any flesh it meets, leaving a trail of necrotic corruption as they do. Although they lose their deathly infusions once removed, the claws remain incredibly sharp and battle-worthy. | 100 gp | 10 lb | Any +2 melee slashing weapon except whips |
| 20 | Devourer Ribcage | Of all horrors, terrors, and ghastly dangers that have been invented by the demon princes, the devourer's chest is doubtless one of the worst. Imbued with dark magic that draws trapped mortals closer to [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus.md\|Orcus']] domain, the devourer's ribs are a powerful crafting component. With a clever act of thaumaturgy, their negative influence can be reversed and used to sustain a creature that is near death. It is a risky proposition however, as the ribs still possess a weak connection to [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus.md\|Orcus]], and so long as that is maintained, he will stop at nothing to claim his prey. | 555 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Breastplate Of The Boundary.md\|Breastplate of the Boundary]] |
| 25 | Devourer Skin | The cadaverous skin of a devourer has practically been tanned into leather while still on the body. It is difficult to remove it without tearing, but when done properly it can be crafted into a cloak that can shelter you from both the elements and from death itself. | 2,250 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Necrotic Cloak.md\|Necrotic Cloak]] |
