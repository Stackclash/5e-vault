| 10 | Cockatrice Bile (vial) | Unlike basilisks, a cockatrice cannot consume stone. Unfortunately, anything that receives so much as a graze from its beak becomes petrified, and with the cockatrice's frenzied hunting style, such an occurrence is more then common. As such, its bile has certain properties that slow down the petrification process, allowing the cockatrice to get some nourishment before its food becomes indigestible. This bile has become a staple of a stonemason's toolkit as it allows them to temporarily soften stone for easier handling. | 2 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Cockatrice Droppings (small pouch) | Cockatrices are infamous for their enthusiasm in devouring a meal, and as such, they occasionally end up swallowing food that they have already accidentally petrified. The food remains stone through the cockatrice's digestive system, and some consider the resulting food statues to be a novelty to say the least. There are even some enterprising individuals who keep cockatrice farms in order to harvest their droppings for stone trinkets (I assume they do not reveal to their customers where they came from however). | 5 sp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Cockatrice Beak | The infamous beak of a cockatrice, capable of turning any living creature into petrified stone. Despite common belief, the petrifying magic has nothing to do with the cockatrice's saliva, but is entirely within the cockatrice's beak alone. Any artificer worth their salt knows the techniques to turn an undamaged beak into a weapon that shares the cockatrice's petrifying ability. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
