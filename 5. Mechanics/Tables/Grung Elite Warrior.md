| 10 | Grung Poison Gland | Unfortunately, the poison of a grung is neutralized shortly after being harvested and is thus effectively useless. The poison gland however still possesses trace enzymes and chemicals that create a mild hallucinogenic when brewed long enough. Some yuan-ti tribes that live near grung tribes have been found with clay pots full of this hallucinogenic drink, ostensibly for ceremonial purposes. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Grung Bladder | In jungles occupied by grung, the echo of their distinctive chirr can be heard no matter where one goes. The chirr is most dangerous when elicited by their elite warriors, denoted by their orange or gold hues. These grung possess a series of membranes kept in a sack below their chins that when warbled appropriately, creates a more mesmerizing tune that can dull the senses of the unaware. Some craftier bards have taken to using these sacks in musical instruments that can create some of the same mesmerizing and hypnotic tones. | 6 gp | 3 lb | [[5.
