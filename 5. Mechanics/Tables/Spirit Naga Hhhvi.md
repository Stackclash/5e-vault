| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Naga Bone | Virtually identical to the bones of an ordinary serpent, except on a larger scale. When ground up into a powder and then brewed into a tea however, it creates an intoxicating drink that some cultures have used for spiritual purposes. Those that have drunk it have claimed visions of long-forgotten histories, but they are inevitably forgotten once the drink has left their system. | 20 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 10 | Naga Scale (3 small pouches) | Nagas are renowned for their rejuvenation abilities, and this property transfers to their scales. Indeed, powdered naga scales are one of many potential catalysts required when brewing the ubiquitous healing potion. | 30 gp | 6 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Superior Healing.md\|Potion of Superior Healing]] |
| 15 | Spirit Naga Fang (×2) | Nagas require no glands to produce their venom as their fangs remain venomous even when the naga is reduced to a skeletal form. Proper extraction and then re-smithing allows these fangs to serve as powerful weapons with an extra poisonous punch. Beware though, as a revived naga may not take kindly to the idea of a mortal running around with one of their teeth. | 30 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Viper Strike Hhhvi.md\|Viper Strike]] |
