| — | Wings of Zariel | Zariel is truly a tragic figure. Once a proud and majestic angel, Zariel fell from grace and now serves Asmodeus as another archdevil in the Nine Hells. The only aspect of her celestial heritage that she still possesses are her mighty wings, but even they have become corrupted into infernos of blazing hellfire that constantly stream from her back. Some paladin orders have devoted themselves to venturing into the Nine Hells and finally putting Zariel to rest and then bringing her wings back so they may be made into equipment that can once again serve the light of justice. | — | 10 lb | [[5.
