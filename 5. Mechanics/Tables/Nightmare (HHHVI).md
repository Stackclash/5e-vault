|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Nightmare Ashes (small pouch) | Nightmares have the ability to grant fire resistance to any creature riding them, ostensibly to avoid burning their riders to death. Upon their death, taking some of their ashes and leaving them in a crucible overnight can create one of the key ingredients of a potion of fire resistance. | 15 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Fire Resistance.md\|Potion of Fire Resistance]] |
| 15 | Nightmare Hoof (Ã—4) | The hooves of a nightmare are jet black and with a bit of artificing, along with expert crafting, they can be turned into miniature statues of the very nightmare they were taken from. This statue contains much of the original nightmare's abilities, trapped inside a figurine form. | 8 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Figurine Of Wondrous Power Obsidian Steed.md\|Figurine of Wondrous Power, Obsidian Steed]] |
