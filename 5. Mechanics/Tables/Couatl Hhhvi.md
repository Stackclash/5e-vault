| 15 | Couatl Venom (vial) | **.** The venom of a couatl is entirely non-lethal, reflective of the couatl's pacifist nature. Couatl are in fact known for occasionally secreting this venom for the mortals they partner with in the hopes of averting deaths wherever possible.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing melee weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious\|unconscious]]. A creature automatically wakes up if they receive damage or if an adjacent creature spends their action to wake them up. | 40 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Couatl Feather (large bag) | The feathers of a couatl are extraordinarily vibrant, yet as soft as down. A particular pillow has been made with these feathers that shares the couatl's ability to shield its mind from external psychic threats. Powerful people have been known to use these pillows to shield their sleeping moments from intrusion, as well as to just get an extremely comfortable sleep. | 120 gp | 5 lb | [[5.
