# Grymclover Forests; Corruptive Influence
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 277* 

The manipulative energy that corrupts a forest into a grymclover one can linger for centuries, if not longer. Such twisted magic can wrack the minds of travelers with doubts and fears. Characters within a forest must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw whenever they finish a long rest or suffer from an effect from the Corruptive Influence table below. A character has disadvantage on saving throws against these effects if it is within 3 miles of a gateway to the plane of the Fey or the realm of shadows and dread. A corruptive influence lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or is targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell or similar magic.
