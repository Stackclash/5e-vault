# Elder Tempest
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 44* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 20 | Entropy Shard | Regardless of their end form, the creation of an elder elemental is an event so momentous that it breaks reality itself for a brief moment. This leads to the creation of an entropy shard: a piece of reality inside every elder elemental that they retain from their multiverse-shattering births. Resembling a pure white piece of glass about the size of a hand, this shard holds pure, primal power and should only be handled by the most experienced harvesters and crafters. | 4,000 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Talisman Of Natures Wrath.md\|Talisman of Nature's Wrath]] |
| 25 | Elder Tempest Spark (vial) | The elder tempest represents nature at its most dangerous and mercurial. However, within the constantly shifting form one thing remains constant: a crackling bolt of lightning that moves like a snake inside the gale of hurricane winds. This spark acts like the "spine" of the tempest, and can be thought of as the core of its being. If you can literally catch this lightning in a bottle, it can provide an audacious tinker enough energy to power an invention that wouldn't be possible by any other means. **Requires [[5.
