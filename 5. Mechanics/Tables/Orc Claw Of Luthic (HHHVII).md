# Orc Claw of Luthic

| 5 | Orc Blood (3 vials) | The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Orc Luthic (VGM).md\|Luthic]], also gave their other fluids full compatibility with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Luthic-touched Heart | A heart touched by the orc god [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Orc Luthic (VGM).md\|Luthic]] is noticeably thicker and redder than a normal heart, perhaps symbolic of the love that orcish parents do show for their children (or it is reflective of the increased blood flow and strength that these orcs have that allow them to use their own claws in place of weapons).<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend your action to eat this heart. If you do so, for the next hour, whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature other than you, that creature may also spend their reaction to move up to their speed toward a hostile creature they can see. This benefit cannot be taken by any character with elvish ancestry. | 5 gp | 6 lb | — |
