| 5 | Yurtrus Ichor (3 vials) | The rotting pus and viscera of a nurtured one of Yurtrus is absolutely packed with disease and plague. Luckily for most of us however, the disease cannot live long once exposed to the elements, and stops being a vector very soon after the death of its carrier. On the other hand, alchemists that have an interest in spreading maladies may make use of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vials]] to gather this ichor and brew it into a most insidious poison. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 3 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Clerics Bane Poison (HHHVII).md\|Cleric's Bane Poison]] |
