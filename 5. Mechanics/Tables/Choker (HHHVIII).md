# Choker
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 12* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Choker Cartilage | The tubular cartilage of the choker allows it a great deal of flexibility and adaptivity, somehow without sacrificing its own structural integrity. For this reason, the cartilage is prized as a crafting material for everything from ropes to reins. In particular, the cartilage is often sought after by tinkers attempting to add realistic joints to their mechanical constructs. | 1 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 15 | Choker Claw (×2) | The starfish-shaped claws of a choker are lined with dozens of small pins that trap a victim's throat much like a bird being caught in a tangle of thorny vines. While they are impractical to use as weapons for an ordinary humanoid, they can be used as climbing aids by the intrepid adventurer (if you can get over the squelching sensation when touching them).<br /><br />**Use.** While holding these claws, you have advantage on Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) checks to climb difficult surfaces. | 4 gp | 6 lb | — |
