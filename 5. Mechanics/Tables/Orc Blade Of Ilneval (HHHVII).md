| 5 | Orc Blood (3 vials) | The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatibility with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Ilneval-touched Heart | A heart touched by the orc god Ilneval beats noticeably faster than a regular orc heart, sometimes even still beating after being removed from its original owner's chest. It's almost as if it is still trying to fight beyond death.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend your action to eat this heart. If you do so, for the next hour you gain the ability to spend your action to allow up to three allies within 120 feet of you that can hear you to use their reactions to make one weapon attack each. This benefit cannot be taken by any character with elvish ancestry. | 5 gp | 4 lb | — |
| 15 | Blade Mark | Ritual scarring is common among blades of Ilneval, both as a means of proving one's devotion and of proving one's strength. While many may find them horrifying to look at, there do exist collectors that appreciate the unique patterns that a blade of Ilneval will make in their skin, paying a premium for experienced blades that have also had the most time and practice to expand their marks. | 10 gp | 3 lb | — |
