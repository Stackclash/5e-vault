| 10 | Duergar Brain | Due to generations of horrific experiments by their illithid captors, all duergars possess a unique genetic mutation that grants them psionic powers. Research from both within and without their own society have come to the conclusion that a large part of this potential is due to certain hormone secretions produced by their brains. When brewed properly, a duergar's brain can become a potion that temporarily grants the drinker psionic abilities of their own. | 5 gp | 3 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Duergar Warlord Blood (3 vials) | A duergar warlord's mind is like almost no other. It is not considered particularly intelligent per se, rather it possesses a keen force of will and presence that pushes its underlings to feats beyond what is physically possible. A large part of this is the warlord's psionic force that bolsters the abilities of the soldiers around them at the cost of their own health and sanity. This psionic strength is only possible through a specialized officers training that results in their brain releasing new hormones that irreversibly changes their body chemistry. As such, the blood of a warlord becomes similar in function to a potion, and can be drunk like one to bestow certain temporary abilities.<br /><br />**Use.** You may drink this blood as an action. For the next 10 minutes, whenever you make a `dice:d20\|noform\|avg` (`d20`) roll, you may use your reaction to roll a `dice:d6\|noform\|avg` (`d6`) and add that number as a bonus to the result of your `dice:d20\|noform\|avg` (`d20`). If you do so, you suffer psychic damage equal to the bonus you received. Creatures that are immune to psychic damage can't benefit from this effect. | 40 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
