# Yagnoloth
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 75* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Yagnoloth Ichor (3 vials) | As slippery as the contracts the yagnoloth writes, traces of this ichor can actually be found in the ink that they use in their business with potential employers. There is nothing stopping us from doing the same with the ichor in order to write nefarious contracts or simple coded messages. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 55 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Confidants Ink (HHHVIII).md\|Confidant's Ink]] |
| 10 | Yagnoloth Ear (×2) | Long and resembling a bat's wing, the ears of a yagnoloth allow them to hear exceptionally well; a talent they often use to listen on secret conversations to give themselves an edge in negotiations. While not inherently magical, some witches and alchemists quite like adding them to serums for curing deafness, under the belief that it will not just heal the affliction, but even grant a degree of supernatural hearing. | 110 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Yagnoloth Giant Arm | Almost comically large, the giant arm of a yagnoloth is nothing to laugh at in a combat situation. Capable of inherent magic or simply brutish strength, the arm is incredibly valuable as a weapon base for the versatile warrior, even if it is a bit volatile and unpredictable at times. | 460 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Tricksters Hammer (HHHVIII).md\|Trickster's Hammer]] |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | Gem of Teleportation |
