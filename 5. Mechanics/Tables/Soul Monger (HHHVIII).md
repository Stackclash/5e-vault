| 5 | Shadow Blight (3 vials) | Due to their prolonged exposure to the draining environment of the Shadowfell, the shadar-kai have become infused irrevocably with the shadows themselves. While this darkness permeates their entire being, the most obvious side effect is the way their own shadows seem to shift and fall from their being like smoke or dripping water. This unique shadow is referred to as "shadow blight" and is used as a catalyst in many nefarious potions and concoctions, or simply taken on its own to suppress one's emotions and life force whenever such a thing would become necessary. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** You may empty this vial over yourself, allowing the shadows to wash over you. For the next hour, you become preternaturally stoic and emotionless, and all of your regular life functions slow down considerably. During this time, you have advantage against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] and any ability check made to track you via your life functions such as heat emissions, scent, and vitality have disadvantage. | 15 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Mark of the Raven Queen | The Raven Queen is a notoriously difficult deity to worship. Mercurial, capricious, and distant at the best of times, it is no small wonder why she seems to boast so few followers. Yet, those that do serve her do so with utmost devotion. It is to these special few she grants her mark: a silhouetted raven head. From this mark, her followers are able to draw strength from the queen of death herself. Even when this mark has been removed from a deceased follower, it continues to channel power that can be repurposed into items usable even by those that shun her. The true question is whether this means we have found a loophole to her powers, or whether she simply doesn't care what we mortals do with her gifts. | 60 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Raven Queens Boon (HHHVIII).md\|Raven Queen's Boon]] |
| 15 | Soul Monger Heart | A soul monger is one of the strongest and most pitiful soldiers in the Raven Queen's army. Racked by overwhelming feelings of ennui, these emotions in turn strengthen the soul monger's powers, making them feel even closer to the concept of death that their mistress embodies. Their hearts are surprisingly heavy for their size, weighed down as they are by negative emotions and pain. A simple squeeze is all it takes to release this stored power and ruin the strength of all those around you.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may squeeze this heart, causing all beasts and humanoids that are not shadar-kai within 5 feet of you to have their speed reduced by 20 feet until the start of your next turn. Once this ability has been used 5 times, it loses all remaining energy and dissolves into a useless dust. | 870 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Void Talisman (HHHVIII).md\|Void Talisman]] |
