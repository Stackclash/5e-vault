| dice: d8 | Example Dungeon Origin | Example Dungeon Inhabitant |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | A spiraling, spiked tower built by a legendary necromancer, such as Dendallen (saddleb.ag/dendallen), or an ancient [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Lich.md\|lich]]. | Roving bands of mindless undead loosely controlled by [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Wight.md\|wights]], an inexperienced necromancer, or other powerful undead. |
| 2 | The grove and accompanying settlement of an old [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Druid.md\|druid]] circle that worshipped a wrathful, primeval god of nature. | Acolyte [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Druid.md\|druids]] follow the footsteps of their spiritual or literal ancestors, working to summon an avatar of their deity to the Material Plane. |
| 3 | A complex of huts and cottages belonging to a coven of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fey/Green Hag.md\|green hags]] that dabbled in magic forbidden even by others of their kind. | One or more young [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fey/Green Hag.md\|green hags]] or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fey/Dryad.md\|dryads]] tapping into the corruptive enchantment for power and knowledge. |
| 4 | The lair of a powerful [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Ancient Green Dragon.md\|ancient green dragon]] trained in druidic magic. | A mixture of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Kobold.md\|kobolds]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Cultist.md\|cultists]], and [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Cult Fanatic.md\|cult fanatics]] attempting to resurrect a long-dead dragon by any means necessary. |
| 5 | The ruined capital city of a nation of ambitious elves that delved too deeply into the arcane and druidic magic of ecological transmutation. | Various hostile plant life and even some sentient plant creatures nourished and empowered by the residual corruption of the forest. |
| 6 | A sprawling and decrepit estate manor, where a cruel [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Vampire.md\|vampire]] reigned by blood and terror. | A group of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Vampire.md\|vampires]] and their surviving spawn have fled from crusaders, plotting and preparing their vengeance. |
| 7 | A camp from which a terrifyingly large and vicious [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Gnoll.md\|gnoll]] band terrorized a vast swathe of the surrounding region. | [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Bandit.md\|Bandits]] or other scavengers are using the dungeon as their base of operations, but the forest's magic is causing them to mutate. |
| 8 | Ruins containing a still partly active summoning circle, where an infamous diabolist released dozens of devils and demons into the world. | A jagged tear in reality itself is allowing various fiends to cross from the Lower Planes onto the Material Plane, potentially heralding a massive invasion on the horizon. |
