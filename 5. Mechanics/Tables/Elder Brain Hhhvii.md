| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Elder Brain Fluid (4 vials) | **.** The fluids secreted by an elder brain resemble that of the fluids excreted by a regular humanoid's, but are in fact more akin to that of an illithid's mucus secretion. This fluid is a rich miasma of enzymes and grey matter that when imbibed, has strong perception altering effects for anyone that is not an illithid.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may drink a vial of this brain fluid. If you do so, for the next 1 hour you automatically succeed on detecting the nature of illusions upon seeing them. At the end of the hour, you automatically suffer one level of exhaustion as your brain resets its sensory intake methods. | 50 gp | 1 lb | [[5.

| 10 | Elder Brain Tentacle (Ã—2) | Although considerably longer than an illithid's, an elder brain's tentacle possesses many of the same anatomical features. When crafted into a whip, they are capable of scouring both the flesh and the mind. | 150 gp | 35 lb | [+1 Mind Whip](compendium/items/1-mind-whip-hhhvii.md) |
| 15 | Elder Brain White Matter | The connective tissue between the many folds and neurons of an elder brain, harvesting this material intact requires an extremely steady hand and extensive medical knowledge. It is however an extremely useful crafting material as it lends itself well for making items that take advantage of its original purpose as a biological method of transmitting information. | 430 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Interrogators Web Hhhvii.md\|Interrogator's Web]] |
| 20 | Telepathic Gland | The elder brain's telepathic gland is a roughly apple sized bulb located on its temporal lobe. Although it is relatively small, the telepathic gland has a huge reach and is responsible for many of the elder brain's psionic abilities. Harvesting it intact is difficult, but it can serve as the basis for powerful magical items. | 1,110 gp | 4 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of Telepathic Control Hhhvii.md\|Amulet of Telepathic Control]] |
| 25 | Elder Brain Thalamus | The thalamus of an elder brain is much like a regular humanoid's and contributes to their prestigious memory. It takes a very skilled artificer to transform it into a magical item, but when done properly, it allows a user to tap into the limitless knowledge of the elder brain. | 3,000 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
