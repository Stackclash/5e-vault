| 5 | Hydra Scale (large bag) | The scales of a hydra have a long history as art materials in coastal societies; hydras are known for shedding many scales throughout their lifetimes. Durable and of a unique hue, they lend an intimidating aesthetic that many tailors would be eager to get their hands on. | 15 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 10 | Hydra Blood (7 vials) | Hydras are well known for their regenerative abilities, a property that has not gone unnoticed by alchemists. In fact hydra blood is one of many potential catalysts when brewing the ubiquitous healing potion. The hydra's powerful blood is known for brewing notably potent mixtures. | 5 gp | 1 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Hydra Tooth (×30) | Incredibly sharp and incredibly numerous. Coastal societies have been known to craft deadly arrows and spearheads from the many teeth that hydras leave behind as they lose and grow new heads. | 3 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/2 Ammunition.md\|+2 Arrow]] |
| 15 | Hydra Heart Piece | **.** An organ capable of scaling up blood circulation regardless of how many heads its body grows, the heart of a hydra is brimming with magical potential. In fact, the heart of a hydra is so powerful that consuming one can even regrow lost limbs.<br /><br />**Use.** It takes 10 minutes to consume enough hydra heart to have an effect. Once consumed, you regain all hit points as well as regrow any missing body parts. If a body part is regrown in this way, you feel an intense feeling of hunger and suffer 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] until you consume at least 5 pounds of food. The hydra heart must be consumed within 24 hours upon the death of the hydra, otherwise it gives no effect. | 80 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 20 | Hydra Spinal Cord | A hydra's spine is a unique piece of biology, capable of adapting itself to more heads than it was originally suited for. Certain vertebrae in particular are noted for holding strong magic, and when used together can make a powerful healing staff. | 350 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
