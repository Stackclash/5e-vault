| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Bulette Teeth (small pouch) | Capable of puncturing even steel armor, bulette teeth are well regarded as materials for crafting daggers and spears. Some cultures even consider bulette hunting to be a rite of passage, using the weapon made from their kill for the rest of their adult lives. | 11 gp | 2 lb | [+1 Dagger](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) or [+1 Spear](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 15 | Bulette Claw (Ã—4) | Capable of powerful digging, the bulette claw makes for a wonderful weapon base, one that is capable of piercing rock and metals alike. | 8 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Stone Cleaver Weapon Hhhvi.md\|Stone Cleaver Weapon]] |
| 20 | Bulette Hide | While the bulette relies on its powerful jaws and claws to tunnel through solid rock, it is aided by a layer of rock dissolving slime that it exudes constantly from its hide. When harvested quickly, the hide itself retains this property and can be crafted into protective equipment for subterranean adventurers. | 60 gp | 50 lb | [[5.
