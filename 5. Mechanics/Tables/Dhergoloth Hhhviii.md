| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Dhergoloth Ichor (vial) | **.** Dhergoloths are probably the most bloodthirsty of all yugoloths. Forgoing any sense of tactics, they simply charge into battle and slaughter their enemies. This resonates into every fiber of their being and especially into their ichor, which may be imbibed to enhance your own violent tendencies and thirst for battle. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial Hhhvi.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** You may drink this ichor as an action, gaining a lust for battle at the expense of safety. For the next 10 minutes, you may use your action to move up to your walking speed in a straight line and target each creature within 5 feet of you during your movement. Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Strength score + your proficiency score. On a failure, they suffer damage as if hit by whichever melee weapon you are currently wielding. This damage does not include any extra benefits that your weapon may impart on a successful hit. If you use this ability, all attacks made against you have advantage until the start of your next turn. | 18 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Dhergoloth Claw (×4) | A literal whirving dervish, the dhergoloth wades into battle with its claws spinning and slashing at all enemies in their path. Excellent for slicing through swathes of unarmored foes, or fields of wheat, I suppose. | 10 gp | 15 lb | +1 Melee Slashing Weapon |
| 15 | Dhergoloth Exoskeleton | The exoskeleton of a dhergoloth is incredibly hard, and yet due to its unique limb configuration, is also very flexible and modular. Due to this bizarre property, it can create a suit of armor that provides good protection without sacrificing mobility. | 75 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Acrobats Plate Hhhviii.md\|Acrobat's Plate]] |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | Gem of Teleportation |
