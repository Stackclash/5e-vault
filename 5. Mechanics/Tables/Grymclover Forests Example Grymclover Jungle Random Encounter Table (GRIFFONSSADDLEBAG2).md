`dice: [[Grymclover Forests Example Grymclover Jungle Random Encounter Table (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md#^2-encounter]]`

| dice: 2d12 | Encounter |
|------------|-----------|
| 2 | An arch of slowly-shifting brambles that acts as a gateway to the plane of the Fey (50%) or the plane of Shadow (50%) during a waxing crescent moon or new moon, respectively. |
| 3–4 | A grymhare (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) innocently lying in a stray sunbeam to lure in unwary prey. |
| 5–6 | A circle of `dice:4d4\|noform\|avg` (`4d4`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Druid.md\|druids]] that are developing a ritual to channel (75%) or cleanse (25%) the Grymclover Forest's corruption. |
| 7–8 | `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Gray Ooze.md\|gray oozes]] (45%), `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Ochre Jelly.md\|ochre jellies]] (35%), or `dice:1d3\|noform\|avg` (`1d3`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Black Pudding.md\|black puddings]] (20%) milling about aimlessly. |
| 9–10 | `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) corrupted, predatory beasts (60%) native to the region, such as bears or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Wolf.md\|wolves]], or corrupted dinosaurs (40%) like [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Triceratops.md\|triceratops]] or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Tyrannosaurus Rex.md\|tyrannosaurus rex]] (see [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Grymclover Forests Corrupted Creatures (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Corrupted Creatures]] sidebar above). |
| 11–13 | The brambles of the forest encircle the party to impede travel. Each character must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage and gain one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] from the constricting vegetation. |
| 14–15 | `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`) bramble creepers (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) or `dice:2d8\|noform\|avg` (`2d8`) archer flowers (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) patiently waiting in ambush. |
| 16–17 | `dice:3d4\|noform\|avg` (`3d4`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Awakened Shrub.md\|awakened shrubs]] (40%), `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`) [[5.

Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Shambling Mound.md\|shambling mounds]] (30%) originally made from the forest's natural plant life, but now corrupted by the forest's choking brambles. |
| 18–19 | `dice:2d12\|noform\|avg` (`2d12`) psybirds (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) or `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) cloverback toads (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) stirring up mist and fog with their movements. |
| 20–21 | A grym-mage tyrannosaur (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) or `dice:1d8\|noform\|avg` (`1d8`) cyglops (see Grymclover Stat Blocks) (50%) hunting and scavenging, respectively. |
| 22–23 | The swirling mists thicken and grow acidic for the next `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) hours. At the end of each hour, a character must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:4d8\|noform\|avg` (`4d8`) acid damage unless they are protected by shelters such as a tent, building, or another fog-proof barrier. |
| 24 | An unexpected dungeon or ruin (see [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Grymclover Forests Example Dungeons Table (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Example Dungeons Table]]) that is younger than the forest's corruption (80%) or is the origin of it (20%). |
