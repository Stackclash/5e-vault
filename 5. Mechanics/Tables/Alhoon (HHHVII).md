# Alhoon
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 31*

| 10 | Alhoon Skin | Due to a lack of mucus, an alhoon's skin is noticeably pale and flakey and can literally crumble once the alhoon has died. Completely useless for any kind of leatherworking, crushing the skin into a dust and inhaling it has been known to induce a psychosis that makes one believe they have died (despite their breathing and walking around providing evidence to the contrary). For some strange reason, some people find this experience to be quite cathartic, causing alhoon dust to be offered in the more exotic entertainment dens. | 10 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 15 | Alhoon Tentacle (×4) | Dry and brittle, an alhoon's tentacles have lost much of the strength and dexterity of a living illithid's. While they have been rendered useless for the purposes of weapon crafting, these tentacles make for a potent magical ink once powdered and mixed with enchanted chalks. | 45 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ink Of Secret Knowledge (HHHVII).md\|Ink of Secret Knowledge]] |
| 20 | Alhoon Heart | As part of an illithid's descent into becoming an alhoon, they must forsake their colony and elder brain, an emotionally painful act even for the usually indifferent illithids. To recover from this self-inflicted wound, alhoons erect barriers around their hearts, both figuratively and literally. With their burgeoning understanding of magic, alhoons cast spells that numb their hearts and prevent them from yearning for a colony they may never return to. This magic remains in their hearts even after their death and yields great benefits when artificing. | 375 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of The Closed Heart (HHHVII).md\|Amulet of the Closed Heart]] |
| 25 | Alhoon Brain | The brain of an alhoon is substantially different to that of a regular illithid. Having severed their connection to the elder brain, the lobes responsible for communication and community are noticeably atrophied, whereas the sections related to curiosity and learning have grown. When used in artificing, the result is substantially different to using a regular illithid's, and instead takes inspiration from the alhoon's nefarious periapt of mind trapping. | 1,600 gp | 3 lb | [[5.
