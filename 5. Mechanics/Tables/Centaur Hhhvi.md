| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Centaur Hoof (×4) | The hooves of a centaur are much harder than those of a mundane horse, and centaurs in their pragmatism have even been found harvesting them for their own use. It is not uncommon for centaurs to be in the possession of tools, bowls, and even weapons made from the hooves of their dead tribal members. | 5 sp | 13 lb | — |
| 15 | Centaur Tail | The hairs of a centaur are renowned for their tensile strength while remaining supple and flexible. As such they make superb bowstrings and centaur archers are known for using their own hairs in their bows. | 3 gp | 4 lb | [+1 Shortbow](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) or [+1 Longbow](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
