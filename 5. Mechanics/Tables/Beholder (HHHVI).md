| 15 | Beholder Membrum | The anatomy of a beholder is infinitely alien and strange to any scholar native to the Material Plane. One of the most curious features of the beholder is that aside from its brain, the beholder features a noticeable dearth of internal organs. Instead, any internal space not occupied by brain matter is filled with a large rubbery balloon that seems to act as the beholder's heart, lungs, and stomach. How it achieves all of these simultaneous functions is unknown. This organ is as versatile as its owner, and many scholars are eager to obtain a complete sample for their research into transmutation. | 45 gp | 40 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Beholder Eye Stalk | While the eye stalks of the beholder may be severed from its body, they still retain some of the magical energy that allowed them to fire powerful rays at their enemies. Skilled artificers can take these stalks and use them as the cores of magical wands that emit the same types of rays they emitted in life. Alternatively, four of the intact stalks may be used as part of a ritual to summon a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Specta(TOR).md\|spectator]].<br /><br />If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll `dice:1d10\|noform\|avg` (`1d10`). The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Beholder.md\|beholder]] statblock. | 650 gp | 9 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Eye Stalk Wand (HHHVI).md\|Eye Stalk Wand]] |
| 25 | Beholder Main Eye | The main eye of the beholder is unique in that instead of issuing forth a beam of magical energy, it instead does the opposite: emitting a cone of nullification that disrupts the Weave and prevents the functioning of any magic it gazes at. While it is inactive due to being severed from a living beholder, learned wizards know how to transfigure this organ into an anti-magic crystal, the type that can be used to protect their own strongholds against magical incursions. | 3,250 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Anti Magic Crystal (HHHVI).md\|Anti-Magic Crystal]] |
