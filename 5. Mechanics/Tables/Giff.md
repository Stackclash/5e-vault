| 10 | Giff Saliva (2 vials)  | If there is one thing the giff are known for (other than being a race of hippo people), it is their overwhelming love for explosives. In fact, even their own biology seems to have an affinity for the field, a the saliva of a giff contains a unique melange of chemicals that can be added to gunpowder mixes in order to make them more stable and resistant to outside moisture. This explains the distinct habit that many giff display in which they absent-mindedly lick their ammunition and weapons as they maintain them. While it is off-putting to most, some alchemists are willing to buy giff saliva for their own uses, and most do not care whether or not it comes directly from the source. | 4 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Giff Skull | Despite all their pomp and fancy over their intellectual and tactical talents, one of the giff's greatest wartime assets is a good old fashioned thick skull. Indeed, the giff's skull is so powerful that one of their many rites of passage involve tracking down an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Ogre.md\|ogre]] and challenging it to a headbutt contest (something that the easily amused [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Ogre.md\|ogre]] tends to indulge in). Aside from their plain utility as helmets, there are some macabre collectors out there that are willing to purchase giff skulls at a decent price, apparently as a strange hobby wherein they attempt to assemble several of them in order to form a "regiment". Don't worry, I don't quite understand it either. | 28 gp | 12 lb | — |
