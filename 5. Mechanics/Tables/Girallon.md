# Girallon
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 22* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Girallon Fur (large pouch) | Snow white, thick, yet softer than it looks. Because of this, girallon fur has been repurposed as a toupee material by anyone who can afford it, and has certainly been found in more than one aristocratic wig. This has given rise to the lower-class derogatory term for out-of-touch nobles: "a girallon scalp." | 4 gp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Girallon Fang (×2) | Yellowed, hard, and sharp, the girallon fang has been refashioned into everything from cutlery, to farming equipment, to weaponry. | 11 gp | 3 lb | Any +1 melee piercing weapon |
| 15 | Girallon Foot (×2) | Due to the magi-artificial nature of a girallon, their body parts are capable of imprinting their properties on anyone that wears equipment made from them. This is especially true in their feet which may be refashioned into a pair of boots that grant the wearer the opposable feet of a primate. | 20 gp | 6 lb | [[5.
