| 10 | Cyclops Eyelid | The enormous lid of a cyclops is made of a strange material, quite different to the rest of the cyclops' skin. The purpose of this is still a mystery, but various crafters have managed to take its esoteric properties and use it for their own entertaining projects. | 10 gp | 4 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Deceptive Eyepatch (HHHVI).md\|Deceptive Eyepatch]] |
| 15 | Cyclops Heart | The extremely large heart of a cyclops. Makes a good trophy when preserved and mounted on a base. | 25 gp | 25 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Cyclops Eye | Once they are roused to interest, cyclopes are known to relentlessly pursue whatever it is they set their eye on. Experiments on cyclops remains have revealed that the eye itself is partly to blame, as its unique situation forces the cyclops to focus on one thing for prolonged periods of time. Artificers have taken this property and applied it into a battle aid that doubles as a stylish dinner party accessory. | 140 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
