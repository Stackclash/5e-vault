# Cloud Giant
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 52* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lock of Cloud Giant Hair | Resembling an errant nimbus, the hair of a cloud giant is considered a valuable textile component. Softer than silk and finer than wool, ostentatious mountain kings may wear vests of these hairs stitched together as both a sign of wealth, and as an affront to the giants themselves. | 55 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Cloud Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the cloud giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 250 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Cloud Giant Strength.md\|Potion of Cloud Giant Strength]] |
| 20 | Cloud Giant Blood (7 vials) | Cloud giant blood exists in a strange transitive state of matter, not entirely gas, solid, or liquid. It seems to shift between all three at the same time, much like their famed cloud fortresses. As such, it can be exceedingly difficult to correctly harvest any of it, but a successful batch can make for miraculous alchemy. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 70 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cloud Step Oil (HHHVI).md\|Cloud Step Oil]] |
