| 10 | The Lost Arm Spike (Ã—3) | As a creature condemned to become a lost of the sorrowsworn continues their futile pilgrimage through the Shadowfell, their features inevitably take on aspects of the desolate land around them. One such key feature is how their arms warp to resemble the jagged spikes and rocks of the Shadowfell peaks. These arms are often used to embrace other creatures in a deadly hug, but become great weapon material when repurposed. It is in fact common to find shadar-kai wielding spears made from these arms, which they find easier to use in conjunction with their shadow manipulating abilities. | 13 gp | 15 lb | [+1 Spear](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 15 | The Lost Skin | The skin of the lost is as dry and desiccated as that of a long-dead mummy; the result of their eternal wandering through the windswept valleys and mountains of the Shadowfell. It takes an experienced leatherworker to tan this hide into a form that won't simply crumble away as soon as it is worn, but the successful result is a leather that protects the wearer from even the most inhospitable environments the multiverse can offer. | 100 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
