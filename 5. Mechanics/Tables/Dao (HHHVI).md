| 15 | Crystalline Powder (vial) | When a dao dies, its body disintegrates into a crystalline powder. Fast hands can capture this powder before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as a material component in many spells. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When casting the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]], you may use the crystalline powder as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead. The spell is also considered to be cast at one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it. The crystalline powder then becomes inert and useless. | 750 gp | 3 lb | â€” |
