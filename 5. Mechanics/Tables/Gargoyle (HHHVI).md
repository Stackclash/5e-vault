| 15 | Shard of Elemental Evil | Gargoyles are formed around the many shards of broken rock that the Prince of Elemental Earth, Ogrémoch, leaves in his wake. While it only contains the tiniest fraction of his power, it still contains strong magic, and many alchemists value them as thickening agents in their potions. If needed, the shard may also be used in the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] spell when divining for Ogrémoch. | 10 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Gargoyle Wings (×2) | The gargoyle is a paradox; a creature made of stone and yet able to fly at amazing speeds. Although its wings are heavy, they manage to catch air just the way a bird's feathers might. While they are incredibly difficult for even the most experienced stonemasons to work with, they can be refashioned into a stone-like cloak that exhibits many strange qualities. | 20 gp | 40 lb | [[5.
