| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Unicorn Blood (5 vials) | Unicorn blood shines like silver with a rainbow sheen. Filled with a regenerative magic, the blood of a unicorn is sought after by every alchemist as a key ingredient in many potions. Most will also have the tact to not ask where you got it. | 10 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Vitality.md\|Potion of Vitality]] |
| 10 | Unicorn Hoof (Ã—4) | **.** The hooves of a unicorn, responsible for the swiftness and grace exhibited by these noble creatures when they run. They also exhibit strong magical properties.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to focus on a unicorn hoof in your hand as well as a location you are familiar with up to a mile away. You then teleport yourself and up to three willing creatures you can see within 5 feet of you, along with any equipent they are wearing or carrying, to that location. If you took part in the killing of the unicorn these hooves came from, the deity that created that unicorn becomes aware of where you teleported to. Once a unicorn hoof has been used once, it loses its magic and becomes worthless. | 40 gp | 17 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Unicorn Glue Hhhvi.md\|Unicorn Glue]] |
| 15 | Unicorn Hair (large bag) | Unicorn hair resembles spun gold and is just as valuable. Woodland elves living in the unicorn's domain often sport bows strung with strands of these hairs, their arrows flying with the speed of the forest's patron. Alternatively, instruments strung with these hairs create an exquisite sound unmatched by any made from more mundane materials. | 330 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Instrument Of Harmony Hhhvi.md\|Instrument of Harmony]] |
| 20 | Unicorn Horn | **.** The horn of a unicorn is one of the most sought after materials in all of artificing and spellcraft. Infinitely usable, these horns have been turned into everything from wands, to enchanted weapons, to just magical dust. If you took part in the death of the horn's original owner however, do exercise caution in who you show your spoils too, as unicorns have many (very powerful) allies.<br /><br />**Use.** The dust made from one unicorn horn can be used to act as the material component in any spell. There is enough dust to substitute for up to 500 gold pieces worth of any material component. You do not have to use all of the dust for the same spell. | 1,000 gp | 13 lb | [+2 Wand of the War Mage](compendium/items/2-wand-of-the-war-mage.md) or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Unicorns Charge Hhhvi.md\|Unicorn's Charge]] |
