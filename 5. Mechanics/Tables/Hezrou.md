# Hezrou
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 24* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Hezrou Teeth (small bundle) | The spiny, shark-like teeth of the hezrou. Menacing when attached to an implement of torture, but their irregular formation makes them useful for little else. | 10 gp | 12 lb | — |
| 10 | Hezrou Blood (5 vials) | The blood of the hezrou is as thick and sludgy as week old garbage, and smells just as bad. If you have the stomach for it however, ingesting it with a few neutralising herbs temporarily inoculates the body to foul miasmas and effluents. | 15 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Pollution Breathing.md\|Potion of Pollution Breathing]] |
| 15 | Hezrou Stink Gland | **.** The rank stench of the hezrou lingers in one's memory long after they have already been removed from its presence. Removing this gland without rupturing it takes an extraordinarily steady hand, but once harvested, can be thrown as a quick and dirty bomb.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may throw this item at a point within 20 feet, causing it to explode on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. | 65 gp | 8 lb | — |
| 20 | Hezrou Claw (×2) | The enormous claw of the hezrou. Incredibly sharp, and never seems to dull. Can be forged into a powerful and intimidating weapon. | 170 gp | 25 lb | Any +2 melee piercing weapon |
