# Rust Monster
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 90* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Rust Monster Bile (vial) | Even though a rust monster may be considered a blacksmith's biggest nightmare, their bile is considered a valuable commodity in their line of work. Strong enough to break down rust and metal, careful usage of their bile can be used to restore old weapons to new, and sometimes can be used to craft metal patterns that would be impossible otherwise. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Rust Monster Antenna (×2) | Rust monsters have the simultaneously wondrous and aggravating ability to sense any ferrous metal within 30 feet of it. This is a property of their antennae, which can be repurposed into metal detectors for ordinary humanoids (their corrosive abilities being neutralised in the process of course). | 1 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Metal Detector.md\|Metal Detector]] |
| 15 | Rust Monster Dust (large bag) | **.** Taking the carapace of a rust monster and grinding it down into a dust is an all too common tactic for subterranean cultures. This dust continues to carry the corrosive property of the rust monster, and can be used as either a defense neutralising weapon, or as a cruel practical joke.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may toss a handful of rust monster dust at a ferrous nonmagical metal item within 5 feet. Upon contact, the dust corrodes and destroys a 1-foot cube of the material. If the item is being worn or carried by a creature, that creature may attempt a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid this effect. If the object touched is a weapon or armor/shield, it suffers a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls or AC offered respectively. If this penalty reaches −5 for a weapon, drops a piece of armor's offered AC to 10, or drops a shield's AC bonus to 0, then that item is destroyed. A single bag of rust monster dust has enough dust to be used 5 times. | 3 gp | 10 lb | — |
