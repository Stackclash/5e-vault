| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lock of Frost Giant Hair | Resembling the frost of an early morning, the hair of a frost giant is considered a valuable resource by hunters and explorers. The hair of a frost giant remains supernaturally cold in most climates even long after the giant's death. Packing perishables in a bag lined with frost giant hair is a good method to preserve them when no other option is available. | 35 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Frost Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the frost giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Giant Strength.md\|potion of giant strength]]. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 135 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Frost Giant Strength.md\|Potion of Frost Giant Strength]] |
| 20 | Frost Giant Tongue | The tongue of a frost giant is remarkably sensitive, coming from a creature so fierce. Unable to stand temperatures that could barely be considered "warm" to most humanoids, these tongues have been adapted for a variety of tools, including the bag of colding. | 425 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Colding.md\|Bag of Colding]] |
| 25 | Mark of Varpak | An everlasting one is a frost giant that has been touched by Varpak. By devouring a troll sent by the ravenous god, the stomach of a frost giant changes irrevocably, bearing what resemble bite marks as Varpak devours anything the frost giant eats. These marks can be excised from an everlasting one's stomach and used to enchant weapons with a dangerous blessing. | 3,795 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bite Of Varpak.md\|Bite of Varpak]] |
