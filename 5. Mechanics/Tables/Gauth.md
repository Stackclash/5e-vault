# Gauth

| 10 | Gauth Stomach | **.** Gauths boast the rather annoying ability to literally consume magic and magical energy. Some believe that this is related to the magic nullification ability of a beholder's main eye, but this is still merely conjecture. Either way, allowing a gauth near your magical sword is a surefire way to end up with a relatively useless hunk of metal.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to rupture this stomach and spill the contents onto a magical item, causing it to lose all magical properties for 24 hours, as well as `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) charges if it is a charged item. This ability does not function on artefacts or items with the *legendary* rarity. | 17 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Gauth Eyestalk | The eye stalks of a gauth are not as powerful as that of a beholder, but they still have some use when harvested and processed by a skilled artificer. If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`). The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the gauth's statblock. | 33 gp | 6 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Gauth Main Eye | The gaze of a gauth differs from a beholder's in that instead of draining magic, the gauth's gaze drains mobility. Why exactly this occurs is up for debate, but some scholars have argued it as proof that movement itself is a form of magic (it should be noted however that these scholars are largely considered crackpots by the greater scientific community). | 115 gp | 15 lb | [[5.
