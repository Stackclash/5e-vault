# Kenku
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 69* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Kenku Feather (small pouch) | Seeing as how kenku are unable to fly, their feathers are largely vestigial. Still, despite their often dirty nature, they make for good quills. In fact, a good way to spot a kenku forger is to look for one that has bald patches over their body. | 8 cp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Kenku Voice Box | Other than their propensity for thievery, kenku are known for their uncanny mimicry abilities. Indeed, a kenku's voice-box is one of the most complex and well developed among any humanoid, and particularly resourceful tinkers have figured out how to modify them into unique musical trinkets and instruments. It would be advised however to avoid anyone willing to indulge in such a macabre craft. | 1 sp | 2 lb | — |
