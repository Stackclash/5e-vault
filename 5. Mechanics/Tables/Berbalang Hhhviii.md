| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Berbalang Ear (×2) | While there is no verifiable use for the ears of a berbalang, they still hold a certain popularity among those that study necromantic magics. It is commonly believed, truthfully or not, that they increase a mage's ability to sense the dead and respond to their hidden desires. | 5 sp | 2 lb | — |
| 15 | Berbalang Tongue | A berbalang is capable of communicating with just about anything, and yet, it rarely speaks. It saves its few precious words only for those that cannot respond: the dead. As frustrating as that may be to any living person trying to extract information from them, it does mean that harvesters can find their tongues in near-mint condition. | 3 gp | 1 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Berbalang Brain | **.** One of a berbalang's more interesting abilities is its creation of spectral duplicates created through sheer force of will. Usually used for spying and information gathering, the mental strain does render the real berbalang comatose during the attempt. I suppose that nothing highlights the berbalang's propensity for introversion quite like the fact that it finds even its own company boring enough to sleep through.<br /><br />**Use.** While this brain is in your hand, you may spend your action to concentrate on it. If you do so, you summon a spectral double of yourself in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. While the duplicate exists, you are unconscious. The duplicate disappears when it or you drop to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it (no action required).<br /><br />Your duplicate has the same statistics and knowledge as you, but cannot cast spells and has no equipment when created. Everything experienced by your duplicate is known to you. All damage dealt by your duplicate is psychic damage. Once this item is used once, it shrivels away and becomes useless. | 10 gp | 4 lb | — |
