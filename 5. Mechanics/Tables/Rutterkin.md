| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Rutterkin Pustules (small bag) | The oozing, festering skin of the beleaguered rutterkin is covered in all times by a myriad of pustules. They smell worse than they look, but this in turn provides them some measure of utility as an animal repellant. Their unholy odor is anathema to most mundane beasts, and desperate farmers have been known to line their fields with the ichor inside to protect their crops. | 1 gp | 6 lb | — |
| 15 | Rutterkin Bile (vial) | **.** Although they are not the strongest of all demons, a single rutterkin can make even the bravest adventurer fear for their safety. This is due to the rutterkin's bile which possesses an insidious poison that transforms and mutates the mortally wounded into a horrid abyssal wretch. I have been unfortunate enough to witness more than one mighty companion laid low by the surprise bite of a rutterkin, forcing me to do my duty and end their new pitiful existence. Although this bile loses potency after the death of the rutterkin, it still maintains some utility as a poison.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may coat one piercing or slashing melee weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition with this bile. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]]. At the end of each long rest, the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Rutterkin Tentacle | In their mad mutations, the rutterkin have developed an auxiliary mouth located, bizarrely, on a long tentacle where one of their arms should be. While this tentacle may be gruesome, the fact that it is somewhat self-aware makes it a boon for tinkers who have managed to convert it into a rather macabre toy. | 12 gp | 15 lb | [[5.
