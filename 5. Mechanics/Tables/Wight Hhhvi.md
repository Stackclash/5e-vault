| 10 | Wight Blood (3 vials) | **.** The blood of a wight is a black congealed mess, however it carries strong traces of necrotic energy. This energy reacts strangely with living creatures, granting them interesting abilities, but at a cost.<br /><br />**Use.** If you drink this vial of blood, for the next 24 hours you gain darkvision out to 60 ft., as well as the ability to see the life spark of all living things. This life spark appears as a white hot aura around a creature's body and is visible even through invisibility, and opaque cover no more than 2 feet thick. While able to see this spark, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find living creatures. However, if you are in sunlight, you also have disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Also, you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have your hit point maximum reduced by `dice: 1d6+2\|avg` (`1d6+2`) until you finish a long rest. You die if this causes your hit point maximum to be reduced below 0 and then rise again 24 hours later as a wandering zombie unless your body is destroyed or you are restored to life. | 5 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Wight Hand | The touch of a wight is known for its life-draining ability. Even after its soul has finally left it, a wight's body is permanently altered by the dark forces that reanimated it. All it takes is for another spark of necrotic energy to restore it to a usable state. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hand Of Undeath Hhhvi.md\|Hand of Undeath]] |
