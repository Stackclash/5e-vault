| 5 | Darkling Ash (small pouch) | **.** The burnt remains of a darkling after its absorbed light has burst out. While it is disappointing that most of their body has been made unharvestable, the ash still holds some magical properties as a light nullifier. This should be obvious in that it was the only portion of the darkling's body to not disintegrate when exposed to a light flash.<br /><br />**Use.** When you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Darkness.md\|darkness]] spell, you may expend 1 or more pouches of this ash instead of the usual material components. If you do so, the radius of the magical darkness you create expands by 5 feet for every pouch of ash you expend. | 2 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Radiant Resistance.md\|Potion of Radiant Resistance]] |
| 10 | Darkling Elder Tattoo | The ritual to become a darkling elder is painful, risky, and costly. The enchanted tattoos contain traces of metals, rare pigments, and magical reagents that are capable of surviving the light flash that accompanies a darkling's death. It is quite difficult to do so, but carefully sifting through the elder's ashes can reveal these tattoo components, which still carry the light they absorbed and are thus extremely valuable. | 4 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
