|----------|------|
| 1 | I've invested a lifetime of effort into my business, growing it from the ground up. |
| 2 | A fellow Guild crafter was my mentor, they taught me everything I know about the craft. |
| 3 | Now that I can't work as much, I've taken on a number of skilled apprentices. They will be my legacy. |
| 4 | The craft itself is everything to me. If I had no outlet for my artistic vision, I'd have nothing worth living for. |
| 5 | I pour a piece of my soul into each piece I make. My life's work and I are one and the same. |
| 6 | No 6th option was present in source on this table, adding reroll since there wasn't anything. ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: Reroll.] |
