| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Allosaurus Jaw | The jaw of the mighty allosaurus, able to bite cleanly through bone and ligament. While it may look crude, this jawbone can be crafted into a greataxe capable of literally biting through an opponent's armor. | 4 gp | 20 lb | [+1 Greataxe](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 15 | Allosaurus Claw | The claws of the mighty allosaurus, able to rend the skin and flesh of its hapless victim. Excavations of sites have found many examples of ancient cultures that made daggers from these claws, which are still in a surprisingly good condition. | 4 gp | 10 lb | [+1 Dagger](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
