# Lizardfolk King/Queen
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 73* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Lizardfolk Teeth (small pouch) | Like an alligator, lizardfolk continuously grow and lose teeth over time. They are not above turning these useful pieces of ivory into tools and weaponry, and indeed, there is no reason why the rest of us shouldn't either. | 8 cp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Lizardfolk Hide | Lizardfolk hide is already about as strong as leather and can withstand cuts and blows that most humanoids would find lethal. These hides can be tanned just like any other reptiles, with the added advantage that it is already in the right configuration for a humanoid to wear. | 1 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Studded Leather Armor.md\|Studded Leather Armor]] |
| 15 | Semuanya's Boon | The heart of a lizardfolk touched by Sess'Inek is as fetid and rotten as the swamp its owner lives in. This black organ pumps a stinking ichor through a lizardfolk's body, making them stronger and more vicious than its brethren. Eating it can bestow a temporary boon to a normal humanoid, but it is advised only to those with a strong will.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may eat this item. Upon doing so, you gain the following abilities for the next hour: you are able to hold your breath for 15 minutes, you are immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition, your AC raises to 15 if it was lower than that as your skin becomes scaly, and once per turn, you may deal an extra `dice:3d6\|noform\|avg` (`3d6`) damage on a successful melee weapon attack, and gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt. Upon eating this item, you must also succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become berserk. While berserk, you must attempt to make a melee weapon attack against the closest creature to you, and/or move as close to them as possible. You remain berserk until the rest of the effects of eating this item also end. | 20 gp | 4 lb | — |
