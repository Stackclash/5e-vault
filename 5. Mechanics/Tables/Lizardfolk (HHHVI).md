# Lizardfolk
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 72* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Lizardfolk Teeth (small pouch) | Like an alligator, lizardfolk continuously grow and lose teeth over time. They are not above turning these useful pieces of ivory into tools and weaponry, and indeed, there is no reason why the rest of us shouldn't either. | 8 cp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Lizardfolk Hide | Lizardfolk hide is already about as strong as leather and can withstand cuts and blows that most humanoids would find lethal. These hides can be tanned just like any other reptiles, with the added advantage that it is already in the right configuration for a humanoid to wear. | 1 gp | 15 lb | [[5.
