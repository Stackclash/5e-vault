| — | Fraz-Urb'luu's Head | In its normal state, the head of Fraz-Urb'luu resembles that of a gargoyle with a smirking, human-like visage. It is completely unknown if this is what the demon lord originally looked like or if this is merely another result of their many arcane mutations and foul alterations. There are legends however that this face is actually the only remnant of the creature that Fraz-Urb'luu used to be. The tale recounts how a mortal trickster descended into Hollow Heart and entered into a game of wits with that domain's previous master. So clever and cunning was this trickster, that they managed to deceive this master into cutting off their own head. Then, with little remorse or hesitation, the trickster cut off their own and let their dark influence reattach it to the gargoyle-like body of their vanquished foe. The creature that rose was the newly born Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception and master of Hollow Heart. | — | 28 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mask Of Multitudes (HHHVIII).md\|Mask of Multitudes]] |
