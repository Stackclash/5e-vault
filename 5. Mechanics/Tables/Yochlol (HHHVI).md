| 15 | Demon Pearl | Yochlol's do not so much eat as they do engulf their prey. While the yochlol's digestive enzymes are capable of dissolving just about anything given enough time, there are occasionally a few items that gather inside the yochlol that do not break down and instead stay inside its slime body. Like an oyster, the yochlol forms layers around these indigestible materials, creating pearl-like substances. Unfortunately these pearls share the same sickly yellow colour as the yochlol, making them more novelties than anything else. | 300 gp | 4 lb | — |
| 20 | Yochlol Ooze (vial) | The ooze of a yochlol is said to be more poisonous than that of the deadliest spiders in the world. It is ironic then that the other societies of the Underdark use this poison against the drow after they have defeated their demonic servants.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:6d6\|noform\|avg` (`6d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 750 gp | 1 lb | — |
