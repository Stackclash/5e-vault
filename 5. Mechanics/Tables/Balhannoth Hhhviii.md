| 10 | Balhannoth Teeth (large bag) | Although deadly when set into the jaw of its original owner, the teeth of a balhannoth are far too irregular to be crafted into practical weaponry. However, these twisted ivories can be ground down into a fine powder, mixed with hallucinogens, fermented, and then imbibed as a nightcap drink called languish. Languish fills the drinker's sleep with good dreams and allows them to live their fantasies for a few hours in the night. But, as with most things originating in the Shadowfell, languish is a double edged sword. It is highly addictive, and those who become dependent on it often find their waking lives to become dull and empty. | 180 gp | 20 lb | — |
| 15 | Balhannoth Tentacle (×4) | Like many of their aberration cousins, the balhannoth features long, spiked tentacles to ensnare its prey. Unique to the balhannoth, however, is that their tentacles also carry extensions of their brain stems similar to the way that an octopus does. As such, when attempting to harvest a balhannoth to reap its infamous desire-reading abilities, it is in fact the tentacles that are the real prize; not the brain itself. | 50 gp | 25 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Balhannoth Hide | As part of their insidious hunting and stalking strategy, a balhannoth is capable of rendering itself invisible to the naked eye. This comes as part of their hide that has absorbed the latent magic of its Shadowfell home. When skinned and tanned, this hide can make a cloak that grants limited invisibility. | 300 gp | 15 lb | [[5.
