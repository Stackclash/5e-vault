| dice: d6 | Bond |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I joined the monastery seeking peace and now that I've found it, I'll defend it to the end. |
| 2 | I'm training hard so that one day, I will be able to find and release the lost soul of a family member. |
| 3 | I struggle to feel peace outside the monastery, it keeps me anchored. |
| 4 | I feel aimless whenever I return to the monasteryâ€”I feel most alive when I'm investigating a haunting. |
| 5 | The monastery guards the border between the Material and Ethereal Planes, preventing conflict wherever we can. |
| 6 | Everyone says I'm too fidgety to ever find inner peace through meditation, but I'm going to prove them wrong one day. |
