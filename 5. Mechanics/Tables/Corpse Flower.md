# Corpse Flower
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 15*

| 10 | Carrion Vines (large bag) | As part of its unnatural germination, a corpse flower subsists and grows almost entirely on the rotting corpses of humanoid creatures. Due to this, the fibers that constitute the vines of this horrid plant are a fair degree more...animalistic in nature. The material of these writing tendrils more resembles living flesh, and it leaks sap as if it were blood. As such, other than being used for necromantic rituals, they can also be quite good for trying to add a bit of roughage to a carnivorous pet's diet. | 40 gp | 40 lb | — |
| 15 | Corpse Flower Petal (×5) | The flowers of the corpse flower bloom with the sickly reds and yellows of a bloated cadaver. Death cults and warlike civilizations have been known to grind these petals up into pigments for warpaint that when applied, whip up the users into a deathcrazed frenzy. | 25 gp | 6 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Corpse Makers War Paint.md\|Corpse Maker's War Paint]] |
| 20 | Rot Musk (vial) | **.** To be honest, the stench of the corpse flower is worse than the slimy grip of its tentacles; it can best be described as death trying to cram itself into your body via your nostrils. This stench originates from a pool of liquid musk at the center of its writhing mass which contains the plant's digestive enzymes and is used to turn the flower's victims into a putrid soup.<br /><br />**Use.** You may uncork this vial as an action, releasing its horrid stench. All creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of you that are not a construct or undead must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]] until the end of the turn. Creatures that are immune to poison damage or the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] condition automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the stench of this item and all corpse flowers for 24 hours. Alternatively, you may pour the contents of this vial on a corpse that is medium sized or smaller. If you do so, that corpse immediately disintegrates into a soft mush. If this mush is left on fertile soil, it seeps into it, causing a new corpse flower to grow there in `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) days.<br /><br />This item degrades `dice: 2d4\|avg` (`2d4`) days after the death of its original corpse flower, becoming a useless (but still unpleasant) liquid. | 350 gp | 2 lb | — |
