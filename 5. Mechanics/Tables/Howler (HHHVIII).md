| 10 | Howler Blood (5 vials) | The terrifying power of a howler goes beyond a scary call and visage. There is something more sinister at work that grants the howler such a presence, something in its very blood. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the howler actually secretes its blood from its eyes and mouth at all times: all the better to spread its horrid fear.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may throw this vial at a space within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of that space must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of that space for the next minute. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] in this way, a creature must use its movement and any available [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action to move as far away from that space as possible. If it is impossible for a creature to move without putting itself in danger, it stays in place instead, using its action to cower. A creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 10 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Howler Teeth (large bag) | The gnashing jaws of a howler are filled with jagged teeth capable of rending apart even the sturdiest of plate armor. It is no surprise that these teeth are highly prized as crafting materials for weaponry with a literally fearsome edge. | 115 gp | 10 lb | +1 Melee Piercing Weapon |
| 20 | Howler Voice Box | The horrid call of a howler is not one that can ever be forgotten in one's lifetime. This terrifying screech owes its unique sound to the howler's vocal cords which are unlike that of any other creature's. These dry, chapped strings seem more like desiccated lines of sinew than vocal cords, but when they resonate, they create the warbling howl that is so known for shaking the courage of mortals. Indeed, fiends have been known to string their instruments with these cords, creating orchestras that terrify adventurers as they venture through their dark halls. | 340 gp | 4 lb | [[5.
