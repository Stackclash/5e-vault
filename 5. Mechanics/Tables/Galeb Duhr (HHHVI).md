| 10 | Enchanted Pumice | The joints of a galeb-duhr are of a slightly different mineral compound resembling pumice. This is presumably to facilitate easier movement for the creatures. While it is extraordinarily brittle once its animating force is destroyed, it makes for an excellent ingredient for magical chalk. | 10 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Living Chalk (HHHVI).md\|Living Chalk]] |
| 15 | Mote of Earth | When a galeb-duhr's form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clods of dirt that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].** | 100 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elemental Gem Yellow Diamond.md\|Elemental Gem, Yellow Diamond]] |
| 20 | Galeb- Duhr Core | Unlike a regular earth elemental, galeb-duhr's have a strong tie to the Material Plane, and this is reflected in their possession of a "core." Often referred to as the galeb-duhr's heart, this magical stone serves as the basis of the galeb-duhr and is the physical embodiment of their identity and form. If recovered undamaged, it can be used to create a new galeb-duhr.<br /><br />**Use.** The galeb-duhr core must be placed inside a pile of rocks the size of a medium humanoid on the night of a full moon. Until the next full moon, the person that placed the core must cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]] spell on top of the chosen pile of rocks every day at the same hour as the placing and maintain concentration on the spell for the full hour. When cast in this way, no elemental actually appears, but the spell slot is still expended. If done correctly, the pile of rocks will coalesce into a galeb-duhr upon casting [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]] on the next full moon. The galeb-duhr is friendly to its summoner and understands anything its summoner says to it even if they do not share a language. The summoned galeb-duhr obeys any order its summoner gives to it to the best of its abilities. A galeb-duhr summoned in this way also remembers any memories its core had experienced in its previous lives. This galeb-duhr does not disappear at the end of the hour and is only dispersed upon its death. | 115 gp | 25 lb | â€” |
