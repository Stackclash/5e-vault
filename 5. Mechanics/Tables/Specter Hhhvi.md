`dice: [[Specter Hhhvi.md#^dc-item-description-value-weight-crafting]]`

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Specter Remnant (regular specters only) | **.** A specter is a being of pure spite and malice, a soul severed from the cycle of death and afterlife. When their form is dispersed, fragments of their soul can be imprinted on spirit paper. These fragments radiate with as much hate as their original complete form, and prolonged exposure to it can result in terrible psychological damage. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** A creature that spends at least 6 hours a day within 30 feet of this item for 7 continuous days becomes cursed. While cursed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight while in sunlight. In addition, their dreams become wracked with nightmares and they gain no benefit from a long rest. If the cursed target sleeps within 30 feet of this item, they must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have their hit point maximum reduced by `dice: 3d6\|avg` (`3d6`) points. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Only one creature may be cursed by this item at a time, and if a creature cursed by this item manages to remove their curse by any means, this item becomes useless and crumbles into dust. | 4 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Poltergeist Paper (Poltergeist variant only) | **.** The confused energy of a poltergeist manifests itself in psychic outbursts capable of throwing full grown men and full sets of furniture across rooms. Upon a poltergeist's dispersal, a sheet of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]] can capture some of this errant energy to be used later for one's own mayhem and mischief. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, this paper may be attached to a target Medium or smaller creature or a target unattended object that weighs less than or equal to 150 pounds. Upon speaking a chosen command word or after a designated amount of time, the creature or object that this paper is attached to is hurled 30 feet in the direction away from the paper. If the paper is attached to a creature, they may roll a DC 13 Strength saving throw to avoid this forced movement. If the hurled target comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) damage per 10 feet moved. This item may be used up to 3 times before it runs out of energy and become useless. | 12 gp | 1 lb | — |
