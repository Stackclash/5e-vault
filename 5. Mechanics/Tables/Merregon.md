| 15 | Sacrificial Spirit | **.** It would be a hard philosophical argument to say that anyone who works for an evil regime is also, by extension, an evil person themselves.

The kind of people that become merregons were soldiers that had absolutely no reservation about the wicked actions they were asked to perform. This fact not only makes their souls much easier to condemn, but also makes for a much easier moral question for us when it comes to utilizing their souls for crafting purposes. **Requires [[5.

Over the decades and centuries, the mask becomes suffused with fiendish energy, transforming them from ordinary plates of metal into genuine magical reagents. The trick, however, is to be able to remove the mask without bringing the merregon's face with it, as doing so will spoil the purity of the metal with the decaying organic material of the fiend. | 100 gp | 5 lb | [[5.
