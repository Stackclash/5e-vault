# Male Steeder
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 66* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Steeder Leg (×4) | The sticky legs of a steeder act as their main method for ensnaring prey. While they are certainly strong, the cartilage quickly breaks down following the steeder's death. However, they can still be rendered down for their adhesives, much like turning horse hooves into glue. Duergar society is literally kept together by this adhesive, and as such, these legs are always in high demand. | 5 sp | 12 lb | — |
| 15 | Steeder Shell | A hardy exoskeleton befitting a creature that resembles a giant spider. This hardy, yet lightweight shell has a myriad of uses ranging from housing, to tools, to armor. | 1 gp | 60 lb | — |
