# Young Remorhaz
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 89* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Remorhaz Blood (5 vials) | Anybody who has slain a remorhaz can attest to the virtually boiling blood that spews forth from its open wounds. This blood remains supernaturally warm long after being removed from its body, and arctic cultures use bladders of this as a form of insulation and heating. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Elemental Tempering.md\|Potion of Elemental Tempering]] |
| 15 | Remorhaz Antenna (Ã—2) | The remorhaz has the uncanny ability to sense the movements of creatures around it, based mostly around its incredibly senstive antennae. If taken in whole, they may be re-adapted to be used as a pair of dowsing rods for security purposes. | 25 gp | 6 lb | Security Antenna |
| 20 | Young Remorhaz Carapace | The thick, iron-like scales of even a young remorhaz have incredible insulation properties and can regulate the creature's insect-like body. | 115 gp | 65 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Remorhaz Plate.md\|Remorhaz Plate]] |
