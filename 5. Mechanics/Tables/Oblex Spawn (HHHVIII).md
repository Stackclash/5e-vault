| 5 | Oblex Slime (5 vials) | The slime of most oozes comprises little more than strings of proteins and acids that give them form and digestive capabilities. Oblexes are a little different however, as instead of simply digesting the body of its prey, an oblex also feeds on their mind and mental energies, thus necessitating a unique set of enzymes that react to the psionic field all creatures produce. These enzymes become mostly inert upon the oblex's death, but some Underdark societies have discovered fermentation techniques that can recycle the slime into an amnesia-inducing drink called "fade". This drink is famous for helping the imbiber forget bad memories; something you would probably want to do too if you lived in the horror that is the Underdark. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
