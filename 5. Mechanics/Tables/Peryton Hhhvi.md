| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Peryton Horn (×2) | The large horns of a peryton are considered quite striking for their strange black lustre. Whether used as a decoration or ground up for medicine, they tend to fetch a decent price. There is also a rumour that a set of dice crafted from the horns of a peryton are particularly easy to use in cheating. This is unsubstantiated, however. | 3 gp | 12 lb | — |
| 15 | Peryton Heart | Perytons have a strange fixation with hearts. While theories abound of their origin in regards to the eating of hearts, it can be confirmed that a peryton's own heart does carry dark magical energy. | 20 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Curse Of Jealousy Hhhvi.md\|Curse of Jealousy]] |
| 20 | Peryton Wing (×2) | The black wings of a peryton are incredibly powerful and agile. When removed properly, they can be used as ingredients in the ever useful potion of flying. | 10 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Flying.md\|Potion of Flying]] |
