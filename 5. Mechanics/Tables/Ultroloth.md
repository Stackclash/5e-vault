| 5 | Ultroloth Ichor (vial) | **.** The ichor of an ultroloth is almost as valuable as that of the yugoloth, full of the inherent magic of the ultroloth. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin writing with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known to the ultroloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any wizard spell from the ultroloth's known spell list that is of a level for which you have spell slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a traditional manner. | 100 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Mark of Gehenna | **.** Other than their general form, every ultroloth carries some mark on their person that brands them as a general above lesser yugoloths, an individual to be respected and feared. This brand is more than an ordinary mark and carries a degree of magic to it that affects the wills of lesser beings even if they themselves are unaware of it.<br /><br />**Use.** While carrying this mark on you, you may choose to gain advantage on any Charisma based ability check attempted on a creature within 30 feet of you that has a CR rating less than that of your character level. That creature does not need to be aware of the mark, but must be able to hear and understand you for this effect to work. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. | 300 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 15 | Ultroloth Eye (×2) | The transfixing eyes of an ultroloth can stun creatures with lesser wills and hold them still as the ultroloth moves in for the kill. | 425 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Helm Of Hypnotism.md\|Helm of Hypnotism]] |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Gem Of Teleportation.md\|Gem of Teleportation]] |
