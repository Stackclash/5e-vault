# Succubus/Incubus
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 98* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Succubus/ Incubus Blood (3 vials) | It is said that just a whiff of this blood can bring even the most chaste paladin to the most depraved acts. Indeed, the wild orgies these fiends hold often cause them to spill their own blood inadvertantly anyway, heightening the passions of all involved. | 3 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Philter Of Love.md\|Philter of Love]] |
| 10 | Succubus/ Incubus Eye (Ã—2) | The ever hypnotising eyes of these lusty fiends can continue to entice any that gaze upon them even after their removal. | 7 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Eyes Of Charming.md\|Eyes of Charming]] |
| 15 | Succubus/ Incubus Tail | The forked tail of these tempting fiends can often be found wrapped around their next victim, playing with them sensually and bringing them ever closer to their fall. When made into a whip, they are just as full of power and temptation as their previous owners. | 40 gp | 8 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Chain Of Command (HHHVI).md\|Chain of Command]] |
