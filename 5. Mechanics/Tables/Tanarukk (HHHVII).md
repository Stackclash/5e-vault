| 5 | Orc Blood (3 vials) | The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatibility with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Tanarukk Horn | Made of the same ivory that forms an orc's deadly tusk, a tanarukk's horn makes a formidable and intimidating weapon. | 25 gp | 1 lb | Any +1 melee piercing weapon |
| 15 | Tanarukk Adrenal Gland | A tanarukk's aggression is legendary among even the notoriously angry orcish race. Part of this is due to its oversized adrenal glands that constantly cause the tanarukk to be in a fight or flight mode (and more often than not, choosing fight).<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend your action to eat this gland. If you do so, for the next hour, whenever you are hit by a melee attack within range, you may spend your reaction to make one melee weapon attack with advantage against the attacker. After the hour, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. | 58 gp | 1 lb | — |
