| 5 | Piercer Musk (vial) | The horrible smelling musk of a piercer, while unpleasant, is not debilitatingly so. Ironically enough, this musk can undergo an alchemical process to be transformed into a rather expensive perfume. Of course, those marketing it are usually reluctant to tell their buyers what it is made out of. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Piercer Shell | The slug-like piercer is covered in a rock-like shell that gives it the appearance of a stalactite or stalagmite. This hard shell has been repurposed into many things in Underdark societies including bowls, furniture, and various tools. | 2 gp | 20 lb | — |
