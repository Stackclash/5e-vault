`dice: [[Bodak Hhhvii.md#^dc-item-description-value-weight-crafting]]`

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Mark of Orcus | The infamous mace and skull symbol of [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus.md\|Orcus]] is carved into every bodak's chest, regardless of their origin. These blasphemous symbols maintain a strong connection to [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus.md\|Orcus]] even after the defeat of its bodak, and there are techniques to use them to channel the demon lord's power for dark and powerful curses. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Curse Of Desolation Hhhvii.md\|Curse of Desolation]] |
| 20 | Bodak Eye (Ã—2) | Pure white, blank and incredibly disturbing. Filled with the unholy, necrotic energies of the demon prince [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus.md\|Orcus]], these eyes can be worked upon by a talented thaumaturge to create a rather morbid set of goggles that allow the wielder to literally see death wherever they look. | 70 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Death Goggles Hhhvii.md\|Death Goggles]] |
