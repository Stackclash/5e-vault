# Myconid Sprout
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 78* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Rapport Spores (small pouch) | This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had uses of its rapport spores ability. These spores have a unique ability to transmit thought between the myconid and other intelligent beings. With some reverse engineering, alchemists have managed to use these spores to create a potion that simulates a similar effect in other creatures. | 5 sp | 1 lb | [[5.
