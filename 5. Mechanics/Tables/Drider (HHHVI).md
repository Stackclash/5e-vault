| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Drider Oil (4 vials) | Anybody who has observed a spider will notice that they do not stick to their own webs, and a drider is no exception. For the drider, this comes in the form of a gland that secretes an oily substance that covers the almost invisible hairs on their legs. This oil prevents them from sticking to any sort of webbing and also contributes to the black sheen on their bodies.<br /><br />**Use.** 1 vial contains enough oil to cover one medium or smaller sized creature. A creature covered by this oil gains the drider's web walker feature for the next hour. | 4 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Drider Poison (vial) | Drider poison is just as deadly as those of the cave spiders it emulates. By removing the gland from under the drider's tongue however, this poison can be extracted and put to better use.<br /><br />**Use.** Can coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or 1 slashing or piercing weapon for 10 minutes. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit receives an additional `dice:2d8\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage. | 20 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Mark of Lolth | Unbeknownst to many is that each drider is marked by more than just the physical transformation of their lower body into that of a giant spider. Each drider also receives a permanent mark in the shape of the symbol of [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Drow Lolth (MTF).md\|Lolth]]. The issue is that the location of this mark changes with each individual drider, so a thorough investigation of the carcass is required to find it. Once that is done however, the mark provides uses in channelling certain powers from the drow goddess, even against her own will. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drow Amulet (HHHVI).md\|Drow Amulet]] |
