| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Hooked Horror Exoskeleton | The hooked horror's exoskeleton is harder than iron, but unfortunately is difficult to reshape and thus unsuited for armor. However, it does have several other uses including being used as a sturdy container, building material, or even as using its reverberative nature as a percussion instrument. Many Underdark cultures thus value these exoskeletons when recovered in good condition. | 4 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 10 | Hooked Horror Cochlea | The extremely sensitive cochlea of a hooked horror is not unlike that of a bat's. Capable of hearing both extreme distances and different wavelengths, this cochlea serves as a key component for various hearing aids and magical items. | 10 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shell Of Hearing Hhhvi.md\|Shell of Hearing]] |
| 15 | Hooked Horror Hook (×2) | The eponymous hooks of the hooked horror. Formed of an extremely hard, yet yielding, keratin material. With slight modifications, these hooks can be turned into a formidable war pick that doubles as a climbing pick. | 10 gp | 5 lb | [+1 War Pick](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
