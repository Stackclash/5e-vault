# Xorn
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 107* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Xorn Stomach | As creatures able to digest metals and gems, a xorn's stomach is one of the hardiest organs in the multiverse. Their digestive tract is valued among jewellers and miners, who use them to clean off items they find in the tunnels. | 10 gp | 50 lb | — |
| 15 | Xorn Tooth (×4) | The teeth of a xorn are capable of moving through rock and stone like a hot knife through butter. They are revered among miners and stonecutters alike for this ability and there is never enough supply to meet demand. Alternatively, a weapon made from these teeth can serve dual purposes when used by the spelunking adventurer. | 8 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Stone Cleaver Weapon (HHHVI).md\|Stone Cleaver Weapon]] |
| 20 | Xorn Eye (×3) | A xorn's sensory organs are incredibly alien to regular humanoids and indeed, as xorn have a strange physiology that blends their eyes and noses together in some bizarre fashion. Either way, these organs are remarkably sensitive to the scent of precious metals and gems. The application of that knowledge should require no further explanation. | 20 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Treasure Compass (HHHVI).md\|Treasure Compass]] |
| 25 | Xorn Shell | A xorn swims through rock the way a fish swims through water, thanks largely in part to its outer shell. It is very difficult to take this shell without cracking it, but if you can haul it back in one piece, it can make for a very useful suit of armor that will have you swimming laps through mountains. | 60 gp | 120 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Stone Swim Armor (HHHVI).md\|Stone Swim Armor]] |
