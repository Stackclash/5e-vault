`dice: [[Making Custom Druid Npcs Flaws (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md#^flaw]]`

| dice: d6 | Flaw |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I am so accustomed to lying and keeping secrets that I struggle to tell the truth. |
| 2 | I struggle to prevent myself from immediately executing judgment when I witness a crime. |
| 3 | I'm so focused on gathering knowledge that I find it painful to share it with others. |
| 4 | My exacting standards of self-perfection drive me to the brink of exhaustion on a daily basis. |
| 5 | I would set the world ablaze if tasked to do so by the Circle. |
| 6 | I truly believe that the world would be better off under the control of dragons instead of mortals. |
