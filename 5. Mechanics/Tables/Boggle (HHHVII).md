| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Sticky Boggle Oil (vial) | One of the varieties of oil that a boggle is capable of creating, a sticky, tar-like substance that traps those unlucky enough to step in it. While not the strongest of substances, it can prove to be quite the nuisance (as anyone with a boggle in their house will discover after they rise from their chamber pot to discover it sticking to their backside).<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to coat yourself with this oil. For the next hour, you have advantage on Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) checks made to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] and any ability check made to maintain a hold on another creature, surface, or object. You can also climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Alternatively, you may spend an action to pour this oil on the ground, creating a 5 foot puddle where poured for 1 hour. Any creature that enters that puddle or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]]. On its turn, a creature can use an action to try to extricate itself from the sticky puddle, ending the effect and moving into the nearest safe unoccupied space with a successful DC 11 Strength check. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Slippery Boggle Oil (vial) | The other variety of oil that a boggle is capable of creating, a slippery substance that makes surfaces virtually impossible to traverse. One of a boggle's most reliable pranks is to simply oil the area around a house's larder, causing anyone entering it to slip and spill all sorts of foodstuffs on themselves.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to pour this oil on yourself. For the next hour, you gain advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) checks made to escape bonds, squeeze through narrow spaces, and end [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grapples]]. Alternatively, you may spend an action to pour this oil on the ground, creating a 5 foot puddle where poured for 1 hour. Any creature that enters that puddle or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
