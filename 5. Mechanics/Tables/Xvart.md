| 15 | Xvart Tongue | Xvarts are pathetic creatures, possessing little talent or ability. Their one claim of power is their natural affinity for vermin (if one can even call that power) that lets them domesticate those beasts the way other humanoids domesticate cattle. This is helped in part by their tongues which can create the clicks and squeaks that mimic the calls of bats and rats. When taken, stripped, and dried, they can be used as a reed in the pipes of haunting. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Pipes Of Haunting.md\|Pipes of Haunting]] |
