# Bone Devil
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 28* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Bone Devil Bone (large bag) | The bones of the bone devil are considerably durable and feel more like steel than bone. They can be refashioned into a suite of fire-resistant tools, but due to their origin, not many are willing to use them. | 20 gp | 40 lb | — |
| 15 | Bone Devil Skin | Despite their appearance, a bone devil actually does possess skin; a dessicated sheet that is stretched tight over its bones. While those properties are undesirable in a skin, they make for a perfect sheet of vellum. Indeed, the infamous skin-bound abyssal tomes found in dark libraries are often made using bone devil skin. | 150 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Devil Vellum.md\|Devil Vellum]] |
| 20 | Bone Devil Tail | The stinger of the bone devil's tail is sharp enough to pierce through even the toughest of armor and deliver a potent dose of debilitating venom. With a few modifications, this tail can be adapted into a whip to store and deliver any kind of poison the wielder wishes. | 500 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Stinger Whip.md\|Stinger Whip]] |
| 20 | Devil Wings (×2) | The diaphanous but extraordinarily strong wings of the bone devil. Despite their relatively fragile appearance, they are strong enough to hold the considerably heavy bone devil aloft and allow it to fly at high speeds. | 250 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
