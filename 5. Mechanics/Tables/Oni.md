# Oni
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 81* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Oni Horn | The horns of an oni are incredibly hard and serve only to add to the oni's devilish appearance. They carry only trace amounts of the oni's innate magic, but they make good magical implements. Cannibalistic cults have often taken to using these horns as ceremonial flasks in their depraved rituals. | 5 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 10 | Oni Blood (5 vials) | Despite being ogres, oni blood carries regenerative properties usually only seen in trolls. This powerful blood is one of the many potential catalysts used for brewing the ubiquitous healing potion. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Superior Healing.md\|Potion of Superior Healing]] |
| 15 | Oni Eye (×2) | The eyes of an oni appear to glow long after they have been pried from their foul sockets. If you are willing to use them, they can be crafted into goggles useful for the adventurer with no darkvision. | 35 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Goggles Of Night.md\|Goggles of Night]] |
| 20 | Oni Hand (×2) | The hands of an oni are much like any other ogre's; tough and powerful. When taken to a blacksmith with a magical bent, they can be crafted into gauntlets of ogre power just like any other ogre's. | 55 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Gauntlets Of Ogre Power.md\|Gauntlets of Ogre Power]] |
| 25 | Oni Heart | The heart of an oni is black as a moonless night and just as terrifying. Used as a conduit, an amulet crafted from this organ can grant the wearer some of the oni's magical properties. | 500 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Oni Amulet.md\|Oni Amulet]] |
