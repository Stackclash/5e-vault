# Female Steeder
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 66* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Steeder Leg (×4) | The sticky legs of a steeder act as their main method for ensnaring prey. While they are certainly strong, the cartilage quickly breaks down following the steeder's death. However, they can still be rendered down for their adhesives, much like turning horse hooves into glue. Duergar society is literally kept together by this adhesive, and as such, these legs are always in high demand. | 5 sp | 12 lb | — |
| 15 | Steeder Shell | A hardy exoskeleton befitting a creature that resembles a giant spider. This hardy, yet lightweight shell has a myriad of uses ranging from housing, to tools, to armor. | 1 gp | 60 lb | — |
| 20 | Female Steeder Pheromones (vial) | **.** A female steeder keeps to its arachnid-like resemblance by devouring its mate after breeding. In order to circumvent the instinctive fear that a male would have towards its natural predator, a female steeder is capable of producing a special pheromone that attracts them and overrides their usual survival instincts. This pheromone actually works on other, similar creatures as well, and wild steeders have been known to use it to attract other prey when they feel the need to hunt.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may smear this bottle of pheromones on the ground next to you. For the next 10 minutes, the first time an insectoid or arachnid creature comes or starts its turn within 60 feet of that spot, they must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to use any of its available speed and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action to move towards that spot, using the safest and most direct route possible. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the effects of this item for the next 24 hours. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
