| 5 | Venom Troll Pustule (×5) | **.** The venom troll does not simply deliver its poison through fang or claw like other creatures (although it is certainly capable of doing that). The much more potent version of their poison comes directly from the festering pustules all over its body which it slices open with its own claws to release a torrent of toxins on its prey. These can be harvested as useful little poison bombs; just make sure they don't pop open in your bag.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may throw this pustule at a space within 20 feet of you, bursting it on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of that space must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 2d8\|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]]. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 3 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Mutagenic Blood (5 vials) | One of the most mutated troll subspecies, the venom troll is practically a walking sack of chemicals and toxins. These mix with its regenerative blood to create a mutagenic substance capable of interfering with the regular body functions of a humanoid and granting them great abilities...or simply poisoning them. It's a bit of a gamble to be honest. | 7 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Adaptation.md\|Potion of Adaptation]] |
| 15 | Troll Heart | The troll heart is one of the few organs in a troll's body that is not pledged to their terrible deity: Vaprak the Destroyer. As such, a troll heart is one of the few pieces of a troll that will not form a new troll around itself over time, and yet, its constant infusion of troll blood gives it some measure of regenerative ability which can be infused into an amulet for an ordinary humanoid to take advantage of. | 83 gp | 12 lb | Troll Amulet |
