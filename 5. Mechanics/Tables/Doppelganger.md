| 10 | Doppelganger Blood (3 vials) | **.** The blood of the doppelganger is unnervingly slick and in its natural state carries the same rainbow sheen as a puddle of oil. When it is being held, it changes colour to match the blood of the creature holding it.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink a vial of this blood that has had a drop of a humanoid's blood mixed into it, you [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Polymorph.md\|polymorph]] into a form identical to that humanoid for the next `dice: 1d4\|avg\|noform` (`1d4`) hours. Your statistics, other than your size remain the same in that form. Any equipment you are carrying or wearing is not transformed. You revert to your true form at the end of the duration or if you die. | 4 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Doppelganger Face | **.** Although the thought may be unpleasant the skinned face of the doppelganger can provide several uses when used as a mask. Even in death, the doppelganger's face maintains a "muscle memory" of the last few identities that it impersonated. With some concentration, someone wearing the face can force it to dredge up this memory and change the wearer's appearance to that identity.<br /><br />**Use.** While wearing the doppelganger face, a creature may spend 1 minute visualising a humanoid that the doppelganger has shape-shifted into within the past 24 hours. At the end of that minute, the face mask fuses with the wearer, causing their head to shapeshift into a perfect replica of the visualised humanoid along with their voice. Nothing else about the wearer's body changes however. After 24 hours, the mask seperates from the wearer, transforming them back into their regular form. The mask then deteriorates into a useless sheet of skin. | 60 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hat Of Disguise.md\|Hat of Disguise]] |
| 20 | Doppelganger Brain | A doppelganger's deception is aided by their low level of telepathic ability. Careful dissection of their brain can yield dark lobes that may be used by an artificer to create a helmet with similar telepathic abilities. | 200 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Helm Of Telepathy.md\|Helm of Telepathy]] |
