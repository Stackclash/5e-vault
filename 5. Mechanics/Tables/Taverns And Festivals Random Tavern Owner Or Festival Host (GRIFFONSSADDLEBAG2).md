| dice: d10 | Tavern Owners | Festival Hosts |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Ilmis** is a female half-orc and former adventurer turned owner, who spent her life savings to buy her favorite tavern. She now offers respite for coin or story, as she's still excited to learn about lands she's never seen. | **Spark** is a reformed male tiefling arsonist that now utilizes extensive pyromantic light shows and fireworks to enhance his festival's other performances. He always ensures water is nearby, just in case. |
| 2 | **Alimorel Wyvernjack** is a large female human who owns an equally large tavern. With her greataxe hung up behind the bar, it is rumored she is part giant due to her height and strength. | **Frostjaw** is a rough-scaled and stern white dragonborn. A thoroughly organized leader, they run the festival like a ship. They even refer to employees as crew and often employ other nautical terms in conversation. |
| 3 | **Ashti** is a human man and ugly as the day is long, but has a charm that comes from his quick wit and quicker drinks. He's not opposed to a bribe to hide someone in a secret room. | **Karethia Brightlow** is a young female gnome that initially joined the circus as a trapeze artist. Over the years, she worked and became the owner. Her flexibility extends to planning and management. |
| 4 | **Okli** is a slim half-elven male with a wide smile and a hiss on his words. He welcomes all into his tavern but is quick to anger when a patron grows unreasonable. | **Briar Fen** is a human who remains sober and somber for most of the year but comes alive with vibrant energy whenever it's time for a festival. Their seemingly boundless energy in organizing the festivities is unparalleled. |
| 5 | **Kavon Brightwood** is an outgoing human tavern owner. He has a knack for remembering names, connecting like-minded visitors, and deducing truths from rumors and body language. He is a self-taught wizard and adds spells to his spellbook as drunken tavern-goers leave their spell scrolls and other arcane writings behind. | **Dematrias** is an ancient gold dragon who enjoys putting on events and festivals in unusual locations, assuming many different forms and names over the years in order to remain undetected. |
| 6 | **Neth'faris** is often mistaken as a quiet bookworm and is quick to sling a drink to a patron to return to reading. It's not unheard of unruly patrons suddenly running in fear from the tiefling after a few sharp, muttered words. | **Tylina Balefrost** is a centuries-old female elf who enjoys a good drink and a better tale. Her expensive tastes allow her to know exactly what is necessary for the highest quality production of an event, and never settles for less. |
| 7 | **Saye** is a large human with a deep laugh and deeper tankards. He keeps a small forest of potted plants in the tavern's storage rooms. | **Cristel Kelmys** is an older human lord infamous for his stuffy, invite-only parties where anyone who's anyone would kill, often literally, for the honor of attending it. |
| 8 | **Nysea** is a djinni who enjoys spending her time mixing strange, magical drinks to serve her unsuspecting patrons, causing all sorts of strange, sometimes unwanted effects. However, the drinks are cheap, which keeps her clientele coming back for more each day. | **Pyp** is a young satyr who enjoys tricks, pranks, and jokes. He's quick to apologize if his actions offend, but doesn't let that stop him from continuing his mischievous activities. |
| 9 | **Metto** is a stone giant that delights in serving smaller folk. They use delicate movements to avoid causing injury and studiously record the life stories of those who are willing to share. | **Torrdok the Magnificent** is a half-orc illusionist that specializes in elaborate glamours and enchantments. He delights in creating fabulous mirages and bursts of color to delight the senses. |
| 10 | **Meeplin Leafjaw** is an ambitious but amateur halfling brewer that uses the tavern's income to fund their culinary experiments. They're all for sale at the tavern's bar, but most avoid them due to their unpredictable results. | **Sir Feren Olefson** is a retired human knight that travels the countryside to attract contestants for his chivalrous challenges. Though the advertisements emphasize fairness and honor, the aging knight never loses a match, which sometimes calls his legitimacy into question. |
