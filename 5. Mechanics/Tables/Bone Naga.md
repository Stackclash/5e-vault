# Bone Naga
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 79* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Naga Bone | Virtually identical to the bones of an ordinary serpent, except on a larger scale. When ground up into a powder and then brewed into a tea however, it creates an intoxicating drink that some cultures have used for spiritual purposes. Those that have drunk it have claimed visions of long-forgotten histories, but they are inevitably forgotten once the drink has left their system. | 20 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 15 | Skeletal Naga Fang (×2) | Nagas require no glands to produce their venom as their fangs remain venomous even when the naga is reduced to a skeletal form. Proper extraction and then re-smithing allows these fangs to serve as powerful weapons with an extra poisonous punch. Beware though, as a revived naga may not take kindly to the idea of a mortal running around with one of their teeth. | 30 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Viper Strike.md\|Viper Strike]] |
