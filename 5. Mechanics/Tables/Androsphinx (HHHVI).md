| 10 | Sphinx Tail | The long leonine tail of a sphinx is incredibly distinctive and carries a great amount of cultural significance in some circles. Some sects and cults have a ritual of encasing the tail in dark wax and burning it as a candle wick. It is said that the visions they see in these seances reveal long forgotten secrets buried by time. Others say that sphinx fur just has a mild hallucigenic effect. Unfortunately, there is a distinct dearth of samples to test these hypotheses. | 300 gp | 12 lb | — |
| 15 | Sphinx Heart | The heart of a sphinx is quite literally full with secrets and mystery. Skilled artificers can bring out this magic in the form of an amulet to aid those who have managed to defeat the sphinx. | 1,300 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of Secrets (HHHVI).md\|Amulet of Secrets]] |
| 20 | Sphinx Pelt | The sphinx pelt is both regal and mysterious. Those who wear it share in the noble countenance of the creature they have felled, as well as their independence from time and space. | 3,000 gp | 40 lb | [[5.

| 25 | Sphinx Wing (×2) | The majestic wings of a sphinx rival that of celestial angels themselves. Like many magical wings, they make prime base materials for a set of artificial wings that grant the power of flight. These ones however have the added bonus of their sphinx owner's abilities of teleportation. | 3,000 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wings Of The Guardian (HHHVI).md\|Wings of the Guardian]] |
| 30 | Androsphinx Vocal Cords | While the androsphinx has access to powerful spells, truly its most feared ability is its roar. A sonic blast imbued with the blessings of the gods themselves, the roar of a sphinx can wreak havoc on a mortal's body. The most learned of artificers have discovered the secret to transforming their powerful vocal cords into instruments to produce the same power. Some believe that the sphinxes themselves imparted this knowledge; why they would do so is a mystery. | 15,000 gp | 4 lb | Horn of the Ancient Roar |
