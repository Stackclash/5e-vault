| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Hippogriff Hooves (×2) | The hooves of a hippogriff contain a unique collagen in them that when rendered creates a high quality adhesive. This glue is prized by leatherworkers and most can never find enough to meet their demand. | 4 sp | 6 lb | — |
| 10 | Hippogriff Feather (×10) | The pristine feathers of a hippogriff carry an almost supernatural aerodynamic quality to them. Fletchers and sharpshooters prize good condition hippogriff feathers for fletching high quality arrows. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Ammunition.md\|+1 Arrow]] |
| 15 | Hippogriff Eye (×2) | It is said that a hippogriff can spot a mouse in a field from more than 2 miles over. Whether true or not, they can definitely spot an orcish ambush coming from a few hundred feet out, and this is another reason that hippogriffs are so highly valued as mounts and companions. | 5 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
