# Tlincalli
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 43* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Tlincalli Leg (×8) | The sturdy legs of a tlincalli are just as capable of scrambling up sandy dunes as they are of marching across miles of baked earth. Once the tlincalli has died however, they can be quite easily snapped off at the joint and repurposed for a variety of tools. | 1 gp | 25 lb | — |
| 10 | Tlincalli Chitin | The hard chitin of a tlincalli greatly resembles that of well-forged armor and it is not uncommon for desert-dwelling societies to proudly wear breastplates made from the tlincalli they fight. A less well known practice is turning the chitin into boards for surfing down sand dunes, taking advantage of the chitin's smooth and silica-phobic properties. | 11 gp | 40 lb | +1 Heavy Armor |
| 15 | Tlincalli Tail | A tlincalli's tail greatly resembling that of an overgrown scorpion's. If steeped in saltwater, dried, oiled, then fitted with the proper mechanisms, this tail makes for a fine whip, capable of delivering large doses of poison. | 25 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Stinger Whip.md\|Stinger Whip]] |
| 20 | Tlincalli Poison (2 vials) | **.** A naturally produced poison that the tlincalli use to even to coat their eggs. This poison is designed to debilitate rather than kill, lending itself well to the tlincalli's penchant for toying with those they hunt.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of ammunition, or one slashing or piercing melee weapon. Applying this poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 4d6\|avg|noform` (`4d6`) poison damage on a failed save and becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute, or half damage and no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] condition on a successful save. If the target failed their saving throw by 5 or more the target is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] while [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 37 gp | 1 lb | — |
