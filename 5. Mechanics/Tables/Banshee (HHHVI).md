# Banshee
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 12* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Banshee Echo | The incorporeal banshee leaves very little behind except the last whispers of its terrible wail. With some spirit paper, a good harvester can collect the echo of this wail before it vanishes forever and use it in times of desperation.<br /><br />**Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend an action to tear this item open and release the banshee wail kept within. All creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes `dice:3d6\|noform\|avg` (`3d6`) psychic damage. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead. | 13 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Banshee Remnant | It takes a particularly nimble mind and fast action to trap enough remnants of a banshee to make a usable crafting item. If successful however, they are often refashioned into enchanted reeds that create a haunting noise when used in wind instruments. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].** | 60 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Pipes Of Haunting.md\|Pipes of Haunting]] |
