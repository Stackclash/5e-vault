| 10 | Wight Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a wight is a black congealed mess, however it carries strong traces of necrotic energy. This energy reacts strangely with living creatures, granting them interesting abilities, but at a cost.<br /><br />**Use.** If you drink this vial of blood, for the next 24 hours you gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to 60 ft., as well as the ability to see the life spark of all living things. This life spark appears as a white hot aura around a creature's body and is visible even through [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisibility]], and opaque cover no more than 2 feet thick. While able to see this spark, you have advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks made to find living creatures. However, if you are in sunlight, you also have disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight. Also, you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have your hit point maximum reduced by `dice:1d6+2\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`1d6+2`) until you finish a long rest. You die if this causes your hit point maximum to be reduced below 0 and then rise again 24 hours later as a wandering [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Zombie.md\|zombie]] unless your body is destroyed or you are restored to life. | 5 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Wight Hand | The touch of a wight is known for its life-draining ability. Even after its soul has finally left it, a wight's body is permanently altered by the dark forces that reanimated it. All it takes is for another spark of necrotic energy to restore it to a usable state. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hand Of Undeath (HHHVI).md\|Hand of Undeath]] |
