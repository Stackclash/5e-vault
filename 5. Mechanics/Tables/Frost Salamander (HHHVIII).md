# Frost Salamander
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 59* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Frost Salamander Blood (7 vials) | The blood of a frost salamander moves with all the frigid pace of a glacier. Permanently cold to the touch, it retains some magic in it at all times that can be turned into a makeshift weapon oil to add frigid power to one's strikes.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of ammunition or one melee weapon. Applying this blood takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer an additional `dice:1d6\|noform\|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage and their movement is halved until the start of your next turn. | 1 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Frost Salamander Fang | The fangs of a frost salamander carry within them all the bite of winter's cold. They are highly prized as a weapon material, and it is common to see strings of them adorning the necks of frost giants to boast of their hunting prowess. | 20 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Frost Dagger (HHHVIII).md\|Frost Dagger]] |
| 15 | Frost Salamander Scales (large pouch) | Like their fire-based cousins, frost salamander scales are incredibly valuable for their elemental harnessing properties. A frost salamander's scales stay supernaturally cold long after death, and they are coveted as materials for making iceboxes in the larders of wealthy individuals. Crafted into armor, they take advantage of the frost salamander's strange reaction to heat in which they seem to derive energy from blazing fires despite their own icy constitution. | 65 gp | 18 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Permafrost Plate (HHHVIII).md\|Permafrost Plate]] |
| 20 | Frost Salamander Breath Pouch | Worse than a wintery blast, the breath of a frost salamander is capable of snapfreezing just about anything that it comes across. The organ responsible for such power is a melon-sized bladder located just above its gullet. Filled with special chemicals, this bladder can either be tapped for unique potion ingredients, or simply burst open to create a freezing explosion.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw this bladder to a space up to 20 feet away, causing it to burst upon impact, releasing a nova of freezing cold. Any creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:8d10\|noform\|avg` (`8d10`) cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. | 700 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
