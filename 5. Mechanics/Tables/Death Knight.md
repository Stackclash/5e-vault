| 15 | Blighted Ash (small pouch) | **.** When the flesh of a defeated death knight is burned in a ritual fire, the resulting ashes retain the same dark aura of its original form. If one has the resolve for it, these ashes can be mixed with oils and special powders then applied to the body to gain certain protections from the undead.<br /><br />**Use.** You may mix these ashes with 20 gold pieces worth of rare oils and powdered gems to create a paste that grants certain defences against undead when rubbed into the body. For 24 hours after using it on yourself, undead creatures have disadvantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks made to find you. In addition, you gain resistance to any necrotic damage dealt from an undead source and advantage on any saving throw imposed by an undead creature. | 800 gp | 3 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Cursed Blood (3 vials) | Blood is a generous term to apply to the coagulated muck that cloys in a death knight's veins. Blacker than the cursed warrior's soul, this substance makes for a versatile reagent in certain desecration rituals and blood curses. Use with caution. | 500 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Desecration.md\|Potion of Desecration]] |
| 25 | Death Knight Heart | Even though a death knight may fall in battle, its dark curse will eventually form a new body somewhere and force its soul to continue its mockery of life. If one takes its heart and preserves it in a secret ritual, the death knight's new body will be formed without the organ. From then on, the missing heart can be used as a method of tracking the death knight, beating whenever it senses its old master nearby. | 4,000 gp | 6 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Black Heart.md\|Black Heart]] |
