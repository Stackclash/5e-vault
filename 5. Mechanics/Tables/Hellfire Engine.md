# Hellfire Engine
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 32* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Bonemelt Oil (7 vials) | **.** Deep in the pits of Avernus lay the Bonemelt Pools: vast formations of roiling red oil that burn with all the intensity that the Nine Hells can muster. Every day, legions of lower devils are sent into these pools to pump this corrosive liquid into barrels that are then loaded into the dreaded hellfire engines to be sprayed indiscriminately on the enemies of its master. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw a vial of bonemelt oil at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact, treating the vial as an improvised object ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: weapon]. On a hit, the target is drenched in oil and take `dice: 1d10\|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage plus `dice: 2d8\|avg` (`2d8`) acid damage at the end of their turns. If an affected creature suffers fire damage that was not caused by this oil, the oil combusts, causing the covered creature to instantly suffer `dice: 2d10\|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage and `dice: 4d8\|avg` (`4d8`) acid damage and removing the oil. An affected creature or another creature within 5 feet can also take an action to scrape off the oil. | 400 gp | 2 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Hellbolt Coil | The lightning flail of the hellfire engine is a mighty weapon to behold, dreamed up in the nefarious workshops of the Nine Hells. The key component responsible for its shockingly destructive power is a piece of hellforged metal known as the hellbolt coil. This coil is capable of channeling the inherent energy of the multiverse to create electrical surges that the hellfire engine then channels into its flail. Particularly talented tinkers are capable of reverse engineering this infernal technology into incredibly deadly weapons made for mortal hands. | 2,850 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hellbolt Striker.md\|Hellbolt Striker]] |
| 15 | Shock Barrel | When a hellfire engine wishes to destroy a target from far away it relies on the thunder cannon. This incredibly destructive armament carries a stronger payload that damages targets far beyond the initial impact zone of the blast, especially when compared to regular cannon shot. Despite common belief, this power comes not from the shot itself, but the enchanted cannon barrel that launches it. This "shock barrel", as it has been dubbed by fiendish scholars, is engraved with devilish runes that enchant any ammunition stored within. Thankfully, an intact barrel can easily be repurposed for use by a mortal adventurer, allowing them to use projectiles that strike with the impact of a thunderclap. | 2,850 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Rumble Quiver.md\|Rumble Quiver]] |
| 25 | Hellfire Core | **.** At the center of a hellfire engine lies the infamous hellfire core: a coconut-sized, superheated ball of black steel forged in fires fueled by the immolation of hundreds of mortal souls. This core acts as the engine's "essence", functioning much like the brain and heart of a normal creature. Due to its horrid crafting method, this core constantly hungers for more souls and is responsible for the reaping, consumption, and transformation of the souls that the engine destroys.<br /><br />**Use.** When you kill a creature while holding this item, you may use your reaction to hold the core over their corpse. If you do so, the core absorbs the recently deceased soul of the creature and destroys it over the course of `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) days. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect. | 9,000 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Engine.md\|Infernal Engine]] |
