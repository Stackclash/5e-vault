*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 29* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Fiendish Poison (vial) | Although the erinyes is a master warrior whose swordplay is matched by few mortals, they are not above poisoning their weapons to further tip the scales in their favour.<br /><br />**Use.** Can coat up to 10 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 hour. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer `dice:3d8\|noform\|avg` (`3d8`) poison damage and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]]. The poison lasts until it is removed by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] spell or similar magic. | 220 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Erinyes Heart | It is said that the first erinyes were fallen angels, corrupted by exposure to the fiendish energies of the Abyss. Whether or not that is true, the heart of an erinyes certainly possesses some degree of corrupting influence itself and can be used as a magical reagent when crafting a cursed weapon.<br /><br />**Use.** Upon successful creation of a weapon or piece of armor that requires attunement to use, the crafter may use the erinyes heart to perform a ritual that curses the newly made piece of equipment. If they do so, the crafted equipment carries a random curse from the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Fiendish Curse Devil (HHHVI).md\|fiendish curses]] table. Performing this ritual destroys the erinyes heart. | 400 gp | 6 lb | — |
| 20 | Devil Wings (×2) | The great wings of the erinyes that resemble those of a fiery eagle in flight. Inherently magical and easily repurposed into a pair of infernal wings. | 450 gp | 25 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings (HHHVI).md\|Infernal Wings]] |
