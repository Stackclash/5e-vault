`dice: [[Ankylosaurus Hhhvi.md#^dc-item-description-value-weight-crafting]]`

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Ankylosaurus Hide | The ankylosaurus is covered with numerous plates that protect it from damage. While difficult, it can be reformed into a set of leather armor that boasts the same protection it did for its last owner. | 5 gp | 50lb | Studded Leather Armor |
| 15 | Ankylosaurus Tail | The tail of the ankylosaurus can crush all of a man's bones with a single swing. Knobbed and reinforced, it makes a fine natural weapon. | 12 gp | 35 lb | Any +1 melee bludgeoning weapon |
| 20 | Ankylosaurus Skull | Sturdy and with thick plates to reinforce it, the skull of the ankylosaurus in many ways resembles nature's first attempt at a battle helmet. Bringing this to a blacksmith of some skill can let them show nature a few pointers. | 48 gp | 60 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dino Helm Hhhvi.md\|Dino-Helm]] |
