| 5 | Black Blood (3 vials) | As a spiritual entity, many would assume that wraiths do not have blood, and in most definitions they would be correct. The "blood" to be harvested from a sword wraith is actually a congealed ooze that drips in their wake from their phantom wounds; a constant reminder of their abrupt deaths and lost chance of glory. Running this blood through a crucible can provide some of the important components for the useful [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Heroism.md\|potion of heroism]]. | 7 gp | 1 lb | [[5.

| 10 | Lost Valor | **.** Like many spirits, the sword wraith is bound to the plane of its death by feelings of regret and unfinished business. In the sword wraith's case, this is their rage at the loss of their chance to win glory in battle. This rage consumes them and fuels both their incorporeal form and their reckless battle tactics. If captured in [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]], it can be embodied inside the wielder, granting them the same bravery and deathless zeal at the cost of some tactical sensibility. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, causing you to become embodied by the lost valor for the next hour. While embodied, you cannot take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action, but you also cannot be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]], and whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed immediately, you may roll a `dice: d20\|avg` (`d20`). On an 11 or higher, you instantly regain 1 hit point. | 20 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
