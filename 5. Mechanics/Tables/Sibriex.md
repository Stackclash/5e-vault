| 10 | Sibriex Cysts (large bag) | The undulating form of the sibriex is covered in oozing cysts that seep with all manner of demonic bodily fluid. Harvesting these is disgusting, to say the least, but they serve an important aspect in arcane academia. Due to the sibriex's natural affinity for transmutation, every aspect of its form provides a fascinating research material for those studying the arts of transfiguration and thus can fetch a fair bit of coin on the open market. Some wizards even go so far as to transform parts of a sibriex into their trademark transmuter stone, claiming that it allows them to shape the bodies of those around them more easily. | 650 gp | 20 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Sibriex Bile (6 vials) | **.** Befitting of the way that a sibriex views flesh as nothing more than malleable material to be played with, the bile that constantly spills from its mouth is highly acidic and capable of dissolving large chunks of organic material in mere seconds. It is easy enough to keep this acid in a vial to be thrown as a crude yet effective bomb, but taking it to an alchemist can allow you to brew a more stable version to coat your weapon to deadly ends.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may make a ranged attack by throwing this vial at a target within 20 feet of you, treating the vial as an improvised object ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: weapon]. On a successful hit, the vial shatters on impact and deals `dice: 4d6\|avg|noform` (`4d6`) acid damage to your target. On a miss, the vial shatters on the ground and is wasted. | 250 gp | 2 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Sibriex Miasma (4 vials) | The sibriex is constantly surrounded by a pool of thick miasma that instantly sickens any living thing it reaches. More than simple pollution, this contamination rots and destroys a creature's very lifeforce and is inherently magical in nature. It is a dangerous substance to work with, but a skilled alchemist can take this miasma and use it to create a potion that transfigures the drinker's blood into a poison to kill their enemies (while leaving the drinker unharmed, of course). | 750 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Concoction Of Contamination.md\|Concoction of Contamination]] |
| 25 | Sibriex Frontal Cortex | In the depraved creativity of the sibriex, there lurks only monsters, demons, and nightmares. Indeed, if one dissects the deformed cranium of a sibriex, they will find a severely misshaped frontal lobe that is literally the twisted mind that creates such abominations. This lobe is brimming with transmutation magic and can become a very powerful amulet once it has gone through the hands of a knowledgeable artificer. | 10,000 gp | 6 lb | [[5.
