# Leviathan

| 20 | Entropy Shard | Regardless of their end form, the creation of an elder elemental is an event so momentous that it breaks reality itself for a brief moment. This leads to the creation of an entropy shard: a piece of reality inside every elder elemental that they retain from their multiverse-shattering births. Resembling a pure white piece of glass about the size of a hand, this shard holds pure, primal power and should only be handled by the most experienced harvesters and crafters. | 4,000 gp | 5 lb | [[5.

| 25 | Leviathan Drop | In its ever flowing form, it may seem like the leviathan has no easily defined form that would make for any sensible harvesting. The people that believe this, however, are not as competent as I. Indeed, for the harvester that is both perceptive and daring, there is a treasure at the center of a leviathan known as its "drop". This fist-sized drop seems like any of the water around it, yet if one looks carefully, they will notice that it never actually loses its shape or mixes with anything else in the leviathan, almost as if a strong, invisible membrane keeps it all in place. This drop, in fact, contains the essence of the leviathan and is as useful for channeling its power as a heart would be in a normal creature. For this reason, the drop is incredibly valuable as a reagent and only the most skilled alchemists have the knowledge and privilege of working with it. | 22,120 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
