| 15 | Magical Breeze (vial) | When a djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze. Fast hands can capture this breeze before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as a material component in many spells. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When casting the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]], you may use the magical breeze as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead. The spell is also considered to be cast at one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it. The magical breeze then becomes inert and useless. | 750 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
