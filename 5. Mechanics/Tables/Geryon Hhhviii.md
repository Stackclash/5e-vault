| 20 | Devil Wings (×2) | Like many fiends, Geryon possesses a pair of wings that grant him flight. And, like many other fiends, these wings do not rely on physics to carry them aloft, but instead rely on magic. When amputated correctly, they can be transformed into the very useful [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings Hhhvi.md\|infernal wings]]. | 2,500 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings Hhhvi.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
| — | Stinger of Geryon | It is said that one of the many twisted "gifts" that Geryon imparted on the mortal world was his stinger; warping and mutating several creatures to carry the same poison and wicked barb as his own tail. Many lesser devils have attempted to assassinate Geryon simply to steal his tail and craft a weapon that they would use to earn glory in the Blood War. Thankfully, the blueprints for such a weapon have been found by some legendary mortal smiths, all it would take to complete it is the stinger itself. | — | 20 lb | [[5.
