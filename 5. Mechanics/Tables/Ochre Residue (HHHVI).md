| 10 | Ochre Residue (vial) | The wobbly material of an ochre jelly is not as potent as other oozes. Indeed, it is weak enough that it can be treated with large amounts of other ingredients and consumed safely. It is not actually uncommon to stumble upon a tribe of kobolds that have set themselves up in a dungeon and farm the local ochre jellies in order to brew a rather noxious ale. | 7 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
