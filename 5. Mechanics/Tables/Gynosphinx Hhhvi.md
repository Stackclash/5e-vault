| 10 | Sphinx Tail | The long leonine tail of a sphinx is incredibly distinctive and carries a great amount of cultural significance in some circles. Some sects and cults have a ritual of encasing the tail in dark wax and burning it as a candle wick. It is said that the visions they see in these seances reveal long forgotten secrets buried by time. Others say that sphinx fur just has a mild hallucigenic effect. Unfortunately, there is a distinct dearth of samples to test these hypotheses. | 300 gp | 12 lb | — |

Skilled artificers can bring out this magic in the form of an amulet to aid those who have managed to defeat the sphinx. | 1,300 gp | 12 lb | [[5.
