**Stage Three Encounters**

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A dead body lies in the character's path. A character who touches the body must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 2 | A retching [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Humanoid\Commoner.md|commoner]] tries to grapple the character, begging for any help. Anyone the commoner touches must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 3 | Three Casques Silencieux ([[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Construct\Animated Armor.md|animated armor]]) gesture for the character to get indoors immediately. They turn hostile if the character resists. |
| 4 | Several mangy [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Beast\Giant Rat.md|giant rats]] attack. Anyone bitten by a giant rat must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 5 | A [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Beast\Swarm Of Rats.md|swarm of rats]] shadows the character as they travel. If confronted, the swarm attacks. Anyone bitten by the rats must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 6 | A young, well-heeled couple cavorts openly, oblivious to the quarantine. These [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Humanoid\Wererat.md|wererats]] don't reveal their true nature unless they must, and then only to blend in with the swarms of rats. |
