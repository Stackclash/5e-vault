`dice: [[Guardian Naga Hhhvi.md#^dc-item-description-value-weight-crafting]]`

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Naga Bone | Virtually identical to the bones of an ordinary serpent, except on a larger scale. When ground up into a powder and then brewed into a tea however, it creates an intoxicating drink that some cultures have used for spiritual purposes. Those that have drunk it have claimed visions of long-forgotten histories, but they are inevitably forgotten once the drink has left their system. | 20 gp | 15 lb | — |
| 10 | Naga Scale (3 small pouches) | Nagas are renowned for their rejuvenation abilities, and this property transfers to their scales. Indeed, powdered naga scales are one of many potential catalysts required when brewing the ubiquitous healing potion. | 30 gp | 6 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Superior Healing.md\|Potion of Superior Healing]] |
| 15 | Guardian Naga Fang (×2) | Nagas require no glands to produce their venom as their fangs remain venomous even when the naga is reduced to a skeletal form. Proper extraction and then re-smithing allows these fangs to serve as powerful weapons with an extra poisonous punch. Beware though, as a revived naga may not take kindly to the idea of a mortal running around with one of their teeth. | 30 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Viper Strike Hhhvi.md\|Viper Strike]] |
| **.** 20<br /><br />(0 if willingly given by the guardian naga) | Naga Heart | **.** The heart of a guardian naga may be taken by force, but it is only useful when given freely by the benevolent creatures. When eaten, the recipient gains the naga's rejuvenation ability for at least one death. In exchange, the naga's own cycle of rebirth is temporarily halted. A guardian naga only does this when it sees great potential in a mortal creature and wishes to be a part of that creature fulfilling their destiny.<br /><br />**Use.** If the naga heart is taken and eaten under the free and willing permission of the guardian naga, the eater temporarily gains the ability to return to life after death. If the eater dies, they will return to life in `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) days and regain all hit points, missing body parts, and be cured of all non-magical diseases. Only a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell can prevent this trait from functioning. In addition, the naga from whom the heart was taken loses its rejuvenation ability until the creature that ate their heart returns to life for the first time using this ability. After the eater returns to life for the first time using this ability, they lose this ability. | — | 15 lb | — |
