*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 106*

| 10 | Wyvern Tail | Wyvern tails, when properly harvested and cleaned, possess weaker forms of the creature's infamous poison. This tail is often kept inside barrels of fermenting alcohol to imbue it with an extraordinarily strong flavour and proof. The proof is so high in fact that it is joked that wyvern tails kill more people after being removed than while they're still attached. | 25 gp | 20 lb | — |
| 15 | Wyvern Wing (×2) | Like the wings of many magical creatures, the wings of a wyvern are capable of being removed and transformed into artificial wings for their new owners. | 25 gp | 50 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wings Of Flying.md\|Wings of Flying]] |
| 20 | Wyvern Poison (vial) | Perhaps the most ubiquitous of all poisons, no assassin's kit is complete without at least one jar of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wyvern Poison.md\|wyvern poison]].<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 15 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:7d6\|noform\|avg` (`7d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 600 gp | 1 lb | — |
