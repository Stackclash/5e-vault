| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Roc Gizzards | Roc is considered quite the delicacy in many mountainous regions. The gizzards of a roc in particular are highly nutritious and fry up wonderfully with onions and root vegetables. | 30 gp | 30 lb | — |
| 15 | Roc Beak | Larger than most humans (as many hapless adventurers find out far too late), this beak is also incredibly strong and capable of smashing steel armor to bits. It is common to find giants using these beaks as various tools, but for a Medium sized creature, it makes for the head of a fine hammer. | 150 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/2 Weapon.md\|+2 Warhammer]] |
| 20 | Roc's Feather | The feather of a roc contains magical properties that make it capable of lifting a creature as large as the roc. It is however difficult to find a sample that retains this property after being removed from the roc's body.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding this item, you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Jump.md\|jump]] spell on yourself at will. This spell ends if you stop holding the feather. | 800 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 25 | Roc Heart Piece | The massive heart of a roc is usually too much for an average adventurer to carry home by themselves. Luckily, the only thing of value is a smaller chamber of the organ about the size of a large basket. This is said to be the place touched by the giant god Annam and is what gives the roc its gargantuan size. | 2,300 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Storm Giant Growth (HHHVI).md\|Ring of Storm Giant Growth]] |
