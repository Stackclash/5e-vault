| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Yeth Hound Fur (large bag) | Due to their nefarious creation, the power of the sun rejects yeth hounds, banishing them into the ethereal whenever it touches them. This property remains in their fur long even after their demise and can be reused as a component of particularly dark rituals. | 6 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Curse Of Suns Bane Hhhvii.md\|Curse of Sun's Bane]] |
| 15 | Yeth Hound Voice Box | The mocking bray of a yeth hound is matched by the calls of few other creatures. When a pack is hunting, these calls echo like a chorus, injecting fear into the unfortunate victim's mind. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Horn Of Fear Hhhvii.md\|Horn of Fear]] |
| 20 | Yeth Hound Spine | A yeth hound's spine is surprisingly supple for such a large creature, and is not formed of vertebrae, but instead a single dark rod. When taken and oiled appropriately, it can be crafted into a bow that fires arrows that hunt down your enemies with the same relentlessness as the yeth hound itself. | 80 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shadow Hunter Bow Hhhvii.md\|Shadow Hunter Bow]] |
