| — | Juiblex Mote | Juiblex's origin is a hot topic for debate among demonologists. Some contend that it rose from the remains of a melted ancient evil, others say that it was a mass convergence of lesser oozes that created a terrifying hivemind, while some simply believe that it sprung forth as a globule of the Elemental Chaos itself. Regardless of which theory is correct, it is commonly agreed that despite Juiblex's constantly dripping and regenerating form, there is one mote inside of it that holds the totality of its essence. It is within this mote that the Demon Lord's power comes fully realised and can be extracted for extremely powerful and foul magics. | — | 6 lb | [[5.
