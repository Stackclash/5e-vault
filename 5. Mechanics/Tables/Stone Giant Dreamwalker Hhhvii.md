| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lock of Stone Giant Hair | Resembling a patch of briar covering a boulder, the hair of a stone giant is considered a valuable resource to stoneworkers. Incredibly rough and bristly, this hair can be used to sand down stone. Getting a sizeable amount from the usually hairless stone giant however can prove to be a challenge in and of itself. | 30 gp | 5 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Stone Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the stone giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 135 gp | 2 lb | Potion of Stone Giant Strength |
| 20 | Stone Giant Molar | The teeth of a stone giant are harder and denser than even the oldest of boulders. Their molars in particular have been noted to be particularly useful for stonemasons that wish to emulate the legendary crafting of the stone giants. In fact, some aging stone giants have even been known to gift their loose teeth to smallfolk they have grown fond of, in the hopes that they use them to carry on their legacy. | 400 gp | 7 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Stone Anvil Hhhvi.md\|Stone Anvil]] |
| 25 | Stone Giant Dreamwalker Brain | The brain of a stone giant dreamwalker hardly resembles a brain at all. Signs of extreme calcification abound throughout the organ, causing it to more resemble a large piece of pumice. Interestingly enough, the calcification is most extreme in the areas of the brain known to be responsible for vision, identity, and decision making. Thus it is theorized by some that the "dreamwalker" state of the stone giants may actually be some form of disease rather than a quasi-mystical experience. | 2,845 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
