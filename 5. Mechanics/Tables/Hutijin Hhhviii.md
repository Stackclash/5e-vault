| 20 | Devil Wings (×2) | Like many fiends, Hutijin possesses a pair of wings that grant him flight. And, like many other fiends, these wings do not rely on physics to carry them aloft, but instead rely on magic. When amputated correctly, they can be transformed into the very useful [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings Hhhvi.md\|infernal wings]]. | 2,000 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings Hhhvi.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
| — | Hide of Hutijin | The thick hide of Hutijin is rough and covered with many scars and battlemarks. As the enforcer of Mephistopheles, Hutijin has seen many a battle and had his skin bathed in the blood and gore of more victories than can be counted. This grants it a supernatural level of protection beyond that of a regular fiend, an aura that radiates out and reproaches any lesser creature that would dare strike the champion that wears it. | — | 30 lb | [[5.
