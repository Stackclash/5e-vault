| 10 | Black Residue (vial) | **.** A sample of a black pudding. Inert due to lacking enough biomass to constitute a full ooze, it nevertheless retains its acidic properties. Can be used as a potent acid. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** A vial of black residue can be poured onto nonmagical wood or metal. The black residue eats through 2 inches of these materials per round for the next 10 rounds, after which the ooze becomes too diluted to continue. | 20 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
