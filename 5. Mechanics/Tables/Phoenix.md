# Phoenix
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 44* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 20 | Entropy Shard | Regardless of their end form, the creation of an elder elemental is an event so momentous that it breaks reality itself for a brief moment. This leads to the creation of an entropy shard: a piece of reality inside every elder elemental that they retain from their multiverse-shattering births. Resembling a pure white piece of glass about the size of a hand, this shard holds pure, primal power and should only be handled by the most experienced harvesters and crafters. | 4,000 gp | 5 lb | [[5.

| 25 | Phoenix Ashes (small pouch) | As a phoenix reaches the end of its current life, it bursts into a fiery nova that consumes its body entirely, allowing it to be reborn inside the cinder-egg and restore its strength. Although the cinder-egg tends to constitute whatever is left of the phoenix's material form, you may be able to gather some remnant ashes that contain traces of the phoenix's legendary regenerative power. When a skilled blacksmith adds these ashes to their furnace, they are able to create a legendary suit of armor that grants the user the same eternal presence as the phoenix itself. | 10,000 gp | 3 lb | [[5.
