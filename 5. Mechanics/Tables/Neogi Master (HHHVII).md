# Neogi Master
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 34*

| 10 | Neogi Amygdala | Most likely due to their harsh natural selection that weeds out the weak-willed, neogi are naturally resistant to any form of emotional manipulation. Biologically, this comes in the form of an enlarged amygdala that gives the neogi a better "fight or flight" response than most humanoids and keeps them grounded in reality.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend your action to eat the amygdala. If you do so, for the next hour you gain advantage on saving throws against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and magic can't put you to sleep. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Neogi Hatchling Poison (vial) | A neogi is deadly even as soon as it is born; it has to be in order to kill all of its siblings and survive its first day of existence. As part of this, a hatchling comes into the world with its poison glands fully formed and productive. Funnily enough, this sometimes results in entire egg clutches dying as the victor of the hatching melee succumbs to the poison of their defeated broodmates.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage and become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Neogi Eye (×2) | Neogi are known for their ability to enslave just about any creature it meets with a single glare, usually an umber hulk that it chooses to serve as its muscle. There is currently some conjecture among scholars that the umber hulk's infamous hypnotizing gaze and the neogi's enslavement glare are related in some way due to their constant exposure to each other, but there is little solid evidence to support this. Unfortunately the last scholar that went out of their way to find some never returned from their expedition. | 60 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
