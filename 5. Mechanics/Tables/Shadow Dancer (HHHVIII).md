| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Shadow Blight (3 vials) | Due to their prolonged exposure to the draining environment of the Shadowfell, the shadar-kai have become infused irrevocably with the shadows themselves. While this darkness permeates their entire being, the most obvious side effect is the way their own shadows seem to shift and fall from their being like smoke or dripping water. This unique shadow is referred to as "shadow blight" and is used as a catalyst in many nefarious potions and concoctions, or simply taken on its own to suppress one's emotions and life force whenever such a thing would become necessary. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** You may empty this vial over yourself, allowing the shadows to wash over you. For the next hour, you become preternaturally stoic and emotionless, and all of your regular life functions slow down considerably. During this time, you have advantage against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] and any ability check made to track you via your life functions such as heat emissions, scent, and vitality have disadvantage. | 15 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 10 | Mark of the Raven Queen | The [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Dawn War Raven Queen (DMG).md\|Raven Queen]] is a notoriously difficult deity to worship. Mercurial, capricious, and distant at the best of times, it is no small wonder why she seems to boast so few followers. Yet, those that do serve her do so with utmost devotion. It is to these special few she grants her mark: a silhouetted raven head. From this mark, her followers are able to draw strength from the queen of death herself. Even when this mark has been removed from a deceased follower, it continues to channel power that can be repurposed into items usable even by those that shun her. The true question is whether this means we have found a loophole to her powers, or whether she simply doesn't care what we mortals do with her gifts. | 60 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Raven Queens Boon (HHHVIII).md\|Raven Queen's Boon]] |
