# Mindwitness
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 33* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Mindwitness Tentacle (Ã—4) | A mindwitness' tentacles greatly resembles that of a mind flayer's in terms of both anatomy and function. Able to stun its prey like a mind flayer's they also make great whips, but their inferior strength means that they need a bit more craftwork to become usable. | 5 gp | 15 lb | Mind Whip |
| 15 | Mindwitness Eye Stalk | The eye stalks of a mindwitness are irrevocably changed by the corruption of an elder brain to favor psionic abilities. That said, they are still useful for crafting magical wands, and depending on what your desired effect is, could be considered even better than a normal beholder's. If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll `dice:1d6\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`d6`). The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the mindwitness' statblock. | 33 gp | 9 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mutated Eye Stalk Wand (HHHVII).md\|Mutated Eye Stalk Wand]] |
| 20 | Mindwitness Main Eye | The main eye of a mindwitness is a pitiful thing to behold (pardon the pun). Due to the beholder's mutation by the elder brain, its main eye has been repurposed into an extension of its brain, losing its infamous anti-magic abilities in the process. Instead, it gains the ability to project thoughts telepathically into those it can see (thus the name), becoming little more than a glorified mail carrier for an elder brain's plans. By combining this eye with a magically enhanced diffraction lens, it is possible to create an item capable of broadcasting one's thoughts en masse (which is a great tool to have when walking out of a poorly written theatre performance). | 70 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
