# Needle Blight
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 14* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Needles (small bundle) | The signature needles of the needle blight. While not more particularly useful than any other needle you would find on the forest floor, some fletchers find they make reliable sturdy material for wooden darts. | 5 cp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Blight Pollen (small pouch) | Most blights are incapable of speech as we understand it. Instead, they communicate with each other through the use of pollen that can be carried for miles. Alchemists and druids however have figured out how to repurpose this pollen for potions that allow the user to communicate with regular plant life. | 3 sp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Speak With Plants (HHHVI).md\|Potion of Speak With Plants]] |
| 15 | Blight Seeds (×5) | The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them. These dry, wrinkled seeds sprout in a matter of hours and grow to maturity in days, forming the infamous vines, brambles, and weeds of a blight infestation. While most of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely with plant life. | 1 sp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Blight Oil (HHHVI).md\|Blight Oil]] |
| 20 | Gulthias Sap (vial) | The bodies of blights exhibit a strange property. When large quantities are mulched and then strained for some time, a few drops of a sticky, dark red sap sometimes drips out which more daring druids use in their rituals. | 6 sp | 1 lb | — |
