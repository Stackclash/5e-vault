| 10 | Duergar Brainstem | Due to their years of slavery to the illithid race, duergar have developed a range of psionic powers. Some of these powers are inherent in any member of their race regardless of training. If one dissects the brain of a duergar, they will find that their brainstem is particularly large and often pulsates even after death. This brainstem may be used as an ingredient in various potions that temporarily grant the drinker the same powers as an average duergar. | 2 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
