| 10 | Lock of Empyrean Hair (×10) | The hair of an empyrean is akin to silk in both its lustre and texture, another sign of their celestial heritage. As such, it makes wonderful material for making hardy ties and ropes. If you want to use it for less mundane purposes however, it makes for a good material component in the augury spell; the hairs changing colour depending on your fate. It would be advised however not to attempt this if your benefactor was also this empyrean's parent. | 25 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Empyrean Blood (7 vials) | If the empyrean's skin and size didn't already give away their divine provenance, their blood surely will. Gold and sparkling for good aligned empyreans, black and viscous for evil aligned empyreans, this blood contains many magical properties, especially in alchemy. Drinkers of any potion brewed from empyrean blood should beware though, as doing so is a blasphemous act that marks the drinker permanently in the eyes of the empyrean's parent. | 300 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Celestial Might (HHHVI).md\|Potion of Celestial Might]] |
| 20 | Marble Skin | The skin of an empyrean resembles that of living marble and shares much of its durability. It takes a very steady hand and great skill to remove it without shattering it into a thousand pieces, but the result is a hide that flexes like leather but protects like stone. | 6,000 gp | 25 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/3 Armor.md\|+3 Studded Leather Armor]] |
| 25 | Empyrean Heart | The heart of an empyrean seems to carry an otherworldly energy when held, and people who gaze upon one often mention feeling boosts in confidence and mood.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may squeeze the heart, activating a pulse of emotional energy and inspiration that bolsters all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet. Bolstered creatures can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of the wielder's next turn. This ability may be used 3 times, after which, the heart withers away. | 20,000 gp | 10 lb | Crown of Celestial Rule |
