# Merrow
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 75* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Merrow Scales (small pouch) | The scales of a merrow are not as vibrant as those of their merfolk ancestors. They do however still hold some use when ground down for the creation of dyes, and dye factories on the surface will pay a decent sum to get their hands on them. | 5 sp | 6 lb | — |
| 5 | Merrow Blood (3 vials) | Compared to regular merfolk, the transformed nature of the merrow makes their blood more useful when used in alchemy. One of the most common uses of their blood is for the ubiquitous potion of water breathing. Ironically, a failed merrow assault can lead to survivors using their blood as a means to go back and hunt their attackers in their own domain. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Water Breathing.md\|Potion of Water Breathing]] |
| 10 | Merrow Claw (×2) | The claws of a merrow are capable of cleaving through flesh and bone and are a merrow's preferred method of attack. When preserved and reinforced, they can serve as vicious spikes on a deadly trident. | 3 gp | 10 lb | [+1 Trident](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 15 | Merrow Heart | The merrow are twisted merfolk, created from the insane corruption of the Demogorgon. This seed of corruption can be found in their hearts which can be crafted into dark amulets that can grant a portion of the Demon Prince's power, but at great risk to the wearer. | 4 gp | 3 lb | [[5.
