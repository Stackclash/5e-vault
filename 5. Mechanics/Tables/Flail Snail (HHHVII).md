# Flail Snail
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 19* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Flail Snail Flail<br /><br />(as many tentacles as it has available) | The eponymous flail tentacles of the flail snail. While powerful when attached to their body, they atrophy from the enzymes in them when amputated and become useless. Only a steady hand and reasonable knowledge of snail anatomy can allow a harvester to slice these off and preserve them long enough to recraft them into something more useful. | 9 gp | 4 lb | +1 Whip, Morningstar, or Flail |
| 15 | Flail Snail Slime Gland | The signature glassy residue left behind by a flail snail as it travels is the undigested remains of whatever it has eaten. An unruptured slime gland is particularly valuable as it holds large quantities of versatile liquid slime. Aside from various alchemical projects, a more mundane use is in cosmetics: adding the slime to powders creates a glittery foundation that shimmers like diamonds. | 30 gp | 4 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Glass Oil (HHHVII).md\|Glass Oil]] |
| 20 | Flail Snail Shell | The incredibly valuable flail snail shell has numerous uses and seems to be a gift from the elemental plane. Even the most primitive of societies have realised the power inherent in these shells, and several tribes have made it a rite of passage for a trio of youths to hunt a snail and then craft three shields from the shell. These shields become a bond mark and point of pride for the three individuals for the rest of their lives. | 5,000 gp | 250 lb | [[5.
