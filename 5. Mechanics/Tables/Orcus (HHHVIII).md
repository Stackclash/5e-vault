| — | Wings of Orcus | As befitting of his monstrous love for reusing the bodies of the dead to bolster his own strength, the body of Orcus is actually made from the corpses of the strongest enemies he slew on the path to power. In particular are his massive bat-like wings that most believe he took from a defeated balor, ripping them off the living demon's body before it could immolate itself in death. As one of his first grabs for true dominance in the Abyss, these wings have been with Orcus for countless ages and have grown in strength with him, infused with all his corrupted majesty and influence. | — | 50 lb | [[5.
