# Gas Spore
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 48* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |

| 10 | Gas Spore Gas (vial) | The lighter than air gas that allows a gas spore to fly remains potent even after it is popped. It takes a quick hand and a deep breath to bottle some without accidentally breathing deadly gas spores, however. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 5 sp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Floating Oil.md\|Floating Oil]] |
| 15 | Gas Spore Colony (vial) | **.** Collecting the deadly spores of a gas spore must be done within one round of the creature's death, as spores that land in inorganic matter become useless. Collection of these spores must be done in a vial that contains a few drops of a creature's blood to give the spore colony the nutrients it needs to survive. While the spores are dangerous to inhale, drinking them also carries a risk, unless the spores are dropped in alcohol, which kills the spores.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, the vial may be thrown up to 20 feet at a target creature, shattering on impact. Make a ranged attack against that creature. On a successful hit, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects described in the death burst trait of the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Gas Spore.md\|gas spore's statblock]]. This item must be used within 24 hours of the death of the initial gas spore's death, otherwise the colony will grow too large in the vial to properly invade another creature's system. | 1 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
