**Bluetspur Adventures**

`dice: [[Bluetspur Adventures (VRGR).md#^bluetspur-adventures]]`

| dice: d8 | Adventure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Characters awake within the shattered remains of a fluid-filled tube deep in Citadel Subterrene. They have no idea how they arrived there. |
| 2 | A cavern the characters were exploring seamlessly abuts with Bluetspur, trapping them in caves overrun with [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Vampiric Mind Flayer (VRGR).md\|vampiric mind flayers]] (see "chapter 5"). |
| 3 | A strange message leads characters to a silvery vessel full of alien mysteries wrecked on Bluetspur's surface. The only surviving creature in the wreck is a cunning [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Displacer Beast.md\|displacer beast]]. |
| 4 | The characters find a strange but adorable creature trapped within an abandoned alien installation. The being is a lovable companion, until it reveals itself to be a **star spawn emissary** (see "chapter 5"). |
| 5 | An acquaintance of the characters complains of reoccurring nightmares. The complaints stop when the dreamer is taken over by an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Intellect Devourer.md\|intellect devourer]]. |
| 6 | An inventor requests the characters' insight into a pill-sized device she extracted from her own body. As the characters examine it, the device projects a map into their minds and emits a telepathic call for help. The map leads to a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Mind Flayer.md\|mind flayer]] who wants to put the God-Brain out of its misery. |
| 7 | A farmer hires the characters to protect his family, whom he believes—without evidence—are being abducted and returned every night. |
| 8 | The High Master mind flayer of Mount Grysl seeks to claim all the God-Brain knows. To do this, it creates a copy of the Apparatus (see ""Mordent"" later in this chapter). All it needs is a relic called the Rod of Rastinon, which it wants the characters to retrieve for it. |
