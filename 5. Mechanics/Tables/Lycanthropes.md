| 15 | Lycanthrope Blood (3 vials) | **.** Their cursed blood is the one constant that all lycanthropes share regardless of were-shape or original species. Both feared and revered in equal measure, the blood of a lycanthrope is not to be treated carelessly. In the hands of a skilled alchemist, it can be used to dampen the worst side effects of lycanthropy, or spread its contagion even further.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may drink the vial of lycanthrope blood and infect yourself with lycanthropy. The effect is the same as if you were bitten by a lycanthrope of the same type as that you took the blood from. For more information, refer to [[/5.
