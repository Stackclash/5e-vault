| 10 | Duergar Brain | Due to generations of horrific experiments by their illithid captors, all duergars possess a unique genetic mutation that grants them psionic powers. Research from both within and without their own society have come to the conclusion that a large part of this potential is due to certain hormone secretions produced by their brains. When brewed properly, a duergar's brain can become a potion that temporarily grants the drinker psionic abilities of their own. | 5 gp | 3 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Pain Engine | An offshoot of the psychic engine, the pain engine is a dark contraption that is more easily wielded by a duergar of lesser psionic talents, at the expense of reliability and stability. The internal design is impossible to replicate for any crafter that lacks psionic ability, but it can easily be reused in other devices, and creative tinkers are always eager to get their hands on samples for their own experiments. | 10 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
