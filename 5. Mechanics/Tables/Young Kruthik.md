| 5 | Kruthik Musk (5 vials) | Although kruthiks have their own language consisting of clicks and hisses, they also utilize an alternate form of communication that relies on scent. By leaving scent marks, a kruthik may leave messages and warnings to fellow members of its race. This versatile musk has been adopted for many uses by more civilized races including perfumes, alcohols, and (ironically) insect repellants. | 2 sp | 1 lb | â€” |
