| 10 | Guard Drake Blood (3 vials) | The blood of a guard drake greatly resembles that of a real dragon, however its luster is noticeably dulled, and it is much more viscous than the famously free-flowing dragon blood. While it contains much less magical potential, guard drake blood apparently smells enough like regular dragon blood to confuse a dragon's sense of smell, thus giving rise to its use in certain dragon baits/repellents. | 2 gp | 1 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Guard Drake Scales (small pouch) | As a guard drake is formed of a dragon's scales, it is no wonder that their own scales resemble that of their progenitors'. They are however, of a much lower quality, and are more reminiscent of the smooth scales of a snake than the heavy plates of a real dragon's. While they are useless for making more guard drakes or for making armor, they can be used for stylish sets of clothing in the striking hues of the chromatic dragonflights. | 6 gp | 7 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Guard Drake Heart | **.** A guard drake's heart is one of the only truly magical organs in its body as it shares an innate connection with the dragon that created it. With a bit of magical altering, it can be used to track dragons wherever it goes.<br /><br />**Use.** If you cast the locate creature spell on this heart once per day for 10 consecutive days, it becomes permanently enchanted and reacts to the presence of dragons that are the same color as the guard drake from whom this heart was taken. While enchanted in this way, the heart will begin to beat while it is within 1,000 feet of that color of dragon, with the heart beating steadily faster the closer that dragon is. | 20 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
