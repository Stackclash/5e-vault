| 10 | Redcap Boots | It is difficult to tell where a redcap's feet end and where their boots begin. Since they never take them off (and are even born wearing them), their feet quite often fuse into the boots themselves. While this is admittedly quite distasteful to look at, it does impart an essence of fey magic into metal form (something that is usually impossible due to the incompatibility between fey creatures and iron). | 9 gp | 15 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Redcap Cap | Regularly soaked in the fresh blood of its victims, the eponymous cap of the redcap is one filled with dark magic. With some artificing adjustments, it is capable of granting heightened strength and aggression to its wearer, but also makes them bloodthirsty and prone to careless zeal in battle. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
