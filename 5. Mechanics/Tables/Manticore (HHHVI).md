| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Manticore Teeth (small pouch) | While a manticore's mouth may resemble a human's, its teeth do not. Displayed in rows of jagged viciousness, these teeth are prized as trophies for their intimidating nature. | 1 gp | 4 lb | — |
| 15 | Manticore Tail | Of all the natural weapons that a manticore possesses, its tail is probably its most feared. Many mountain expeditions have ended with its members impaled by dozens of razor sharp spikes. | 10 gp | — | [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Weapon.md\|+1 Whip]] |
| 20 | Manticore Wing (×2) | The powerful wings of a manticore create a distinctive silhouette in the sky that many mountaineers dread. The inherent flight magic held in the leather of these wings can be used to craft a useful cloak. | 40 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Manticore Cloak (HHHVI).md\|Manticore Cloak]] |
