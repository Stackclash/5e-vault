# Allip
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 8* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Secret Smoke (vial) | **.** Although an allip consists of little more than billowy smoke, a harvester with quick hands can still manage to snag something of use from the blasted creature before it dissipates into the ether. When breathed in by a humanoid, this smoke causes a dissonance in the brain's chemistry that causes truth and lies to become blurred. Although this causes some delirium in the mind of the inhaler, it also allows them to befuddle even the most astute interrogators and magical lie-detectors. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may uncork this vial and breathe in the magical smoke within. For the next hour, you have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]) checks, you are immune to any ability that would attempt to read your thoughts, and you automatically succeed on any saving throw that would compel you to tell the truth or allow a creature to discern if you are lying. Furthermore, if you are subjected to the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Zone Of Truth.md\|zone of truth]] spell, the caster believes that you are telling the truth at all times, regardless of whether you actually are. This vial has enough smoke for three uses. | 36 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Psyche Echo | **.** An allip often attempts to share its forbidden lore by enticing scholars to scribble down their secrets on ream after ream of parchment. As such, I feel that the allip would want nothing more than to have its psychic remains trapped inside a sheet of spirit paper and we are in fact doing a service to the creature, rather than doing anything untowards. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the allip fragment within. If you do so, all creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 2d8\|avg\|noform` (`2d8`) psychic damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]]. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. | 60 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enigma Sheet.md\|Enigma Sheet]] |
