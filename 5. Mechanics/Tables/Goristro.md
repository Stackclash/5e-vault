# Goristro
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 24* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Goristro Fur (large pouch) | The fur of a goristro resembles that of a wild bull and seems to constantly emanate a faint heat. More ostentatious warlocks tend to spin their winter cloaks from this material, but whether or not it has any magical utility is still up for debate. | 200 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Goristro Blood (7 vials) | The blood of the goristro constantly bubbles, even long after it is removed from its source. When prepared into a potion, it can grant the drinker the strength of the demon it came from, but the side effects may not be worth it. | 100 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of The Siege.md\|Potion of the Siege]] |
| 20 | Goristro Hoof (×2) | A goristro's hoof is made of the same material as its infamous horns and thus are just as hard. Wielding a hammer forged from these hooves is a sure-fire way to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies. | 3,000 gp | 32 lb | [+3 Warhammer](compendium/items/3-weapon.md) |
| 25 | Goristro Horn (×2) | Castle architects and siege masters have an old joke, that if armies ever learned how to train goristros, they'd both be out of a job. Indeed, the horn of the goristro is stronger than castle stone walls and a single one of these demons are capable of ending a siege by themselves. It takes a master craftsman to properly grind these horns down, but the resulting dust can be used to reinforce a weapon to make it as strong as the demon it was harvested from. | 9,600 gp | 40 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Siege Dust.md\|Siege Dust]] |
