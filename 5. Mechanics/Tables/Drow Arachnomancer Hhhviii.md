| 10 | Drow Blood (3 vials) | Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of Lolth, drow blood possesses some unique property that when rebrewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers. | 1 gp | 1 lb | Drow Poison |
| 15 | Drow Heart | **.** Obviously, every drow has a heart (despite any evidence to the contrary), yet only the powerful in their society are blessed enough by Lolth for their hearts to be worth anything. As a drow climbs in their society, Lolth's rewards to them begin to compound, causing them to become slightly more magical. Upon their death, their hearts may be removed and this magic released to simulate the gifts that Lolth once offered them in life.<br /><br />**Use.** By using an action to stab the heart with a knife, the user may use the *summon demon* ability listed in the drow priestess' statblock. After this, the heart is rendered useless. In order to use this ability, the user must be able to cast the summon lesser demons spell. | 30 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Mark of Lolth | As a symbol of their eternal worship to their dark mistress, priestesses of Lolth have her brand permanently marked onto their bodies. If harvested and preserved properly, its powers can be transferred to an amulet that can channel the Spider Goddess' powers, whether she likes it or not. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [[5.

| 25 | Arachidney Gland | **.** When a drow priestess offers herself to the Spider Queen to become an arachnomancer, they are changed irreversibly, even in their natural drow form. As they complete the dark ritual, a new organ called the arachidney gland grows inside their body close to their large intestine. This gland is responsible for providing much of the transformative magic of the arachnomancer and is extremely difficult to remove without ruining it permanently. If successful however, it becomes a potent source of magic with many powerful uses. In fact, most of these uses were discovered by other drow that hunted the arachnomancers of other houses and converted their carcasses into equipment to further escalate their vendettas; all to the Spider Queen's amusement, of course.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may burst this gland, causing the bile inside to spill out and cover either yourself, or a creature within 5 feet of you. A creature covered in this bile must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be transformed into a giant spider for 1 hour as if by the polymorph spell [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (your DM has the statblock)]. A creature may choose to willingly fail the saving throw if they wish. Anything that the creature was wearing or carrying beforehand melds into their giant spider form. They cannot activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of their equipment. The creature reverts to their original form and hit points if they are reduced to 0 hit points in their transformed state. | 4,250 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
