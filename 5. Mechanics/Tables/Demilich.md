# Demilich
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 21* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Bone Dust (small pouch) | The disintegrated remains of a demilich's body. Every-time you look away, it seems to move slightly. Can be used as a spell component for powerful and dark necromantic magics. | 800 gp | 2 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Demilich Smoke (vial) | Rather than a corporeal body, most of the demilich's shape consists of a choking vapour that smells like forgotten tombs. This smoke contains an almost insignificantly small fraction of the demilich's true essence, but if bottled and stored properly, can be turned into an item to track the demilich wherever it may reappear. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 3,000 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Demilich Censer.md\|Demilich Censer]] |
| 25 | Soul Gem (Acererak disciple Demilich only) | The demilich disciples of Acererak practice a particularly notorious necromantic magic: inserting soul gems into their empty eye sockets to steal the spirits of their victims. While taking the gem away from a defeated demilich is simply a matter of picking it up, turning it over to your own control is considerably harder and requires a complicated ritual soon after the demilich's defeat. A successful result grants the bearer a powerful, but dark magical artifact. | 16,000 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Turned Soul Gem.md\|Turned Soul Gem]] |
