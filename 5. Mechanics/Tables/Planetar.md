# Planetar
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 9* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Planetar Ear (×2) | **.** A planetar is known for its ability to hear lies whenever they are spoken. Their ears carry on this trait even in death and can be seen twitching when falsehood passes through them.<br /><br />**Use.** While holding two of these ears, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) ability checks to detect a lie being spoken. | 200 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Planetar Blood (3 vials) | **.** The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this blood, you regain `dice: 6d8 + 3\|avg` (`6d8 + 3`) hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness. | 600 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Planetar Wing (×2) | There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the silhouette of glorious white angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wings Of Flying.md\|wings of flying]]. | 700 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wings Of Flying.md\|Wings of Flying]] |
| 25 | Planetar bone | The celestial bones of a planetar are stronger than steel and carry a charge of radiant energy within them long after their owner's demise. While most radiantly infused weapons are designed to force evil creatures to scurry away, weapons forged from the ever-vigilant planetars are designed to keep evil creatures nearby, ensuring they meet their divine judgement. | 7,500 gp | 6 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Divine Justice.md\|Divine Justice]] |
