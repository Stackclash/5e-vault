*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 63* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Sea Hag Hair (small pouch) | Resembling rotten seaweed, the hair of a sea hag can be washed, sliced, dried, and then seeped for a prolonged time to create a potion of water breathing. It should be warned however that drinking a potion made from sea hag hair has the potential to infect a victim with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease). | 1 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Water Breathing.md\|Potion of Water Breathing]] |
| 10 | Hag Blood (3 vials) | Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease). It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Sea Hag Skull | While devoid of its characteristic facial features, the skull of the sea hag still carries a malevolent aura that chills any that gaze upon it. | 15 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Fear Skull.md\|Fear Skull]] |
| 20 | Hag Eyeball | **.** Not to be confused with the notorious "hag eye" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer `dice: 3d10\|avg` (`3d10`) psychic damage and are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] for 24 hours. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
