`dice: [[Night Hag Hhhvi.md#^dc-item-description-value-weight-crafting]]`

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Night Hag Hair (small pouch) | As thick and dark as a suffocating night, night hag hair carries some of the magical properties once abused by its previous owner. | 3 gp | 4 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Night Hag Dreamcatcher Hhhvi.md\|Night Hag Dreamcatcher]] |
| 10 | Hag Blood (3 vials) | Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with [crone's disease](/compendium/rules/diseases.md#crone's%20disease). It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Night Hag Skull | The skull of the night hag continues to carry the same dark energies that it once held in life, corrupting mortals and driving them mad with nightmares. | 25 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Nightmare Skull Hhhvi.md\|Nightmare Skull]] |
| 20 | Hag Eyeball | **.** Not to be confused with the notorious "hag eye" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer `dice: 3d10\|avg` (`3d10`) psychic damage and are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] for 24 hours. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
