# Choldrith
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 12* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Choldrith Blood (3 vials) | Choldrith blood is even more potent than chitine blood when it comes to producing the poisonous enzymes that constitute [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drow Poison.md\|drow poison]]. As such, choldriths have become capable of creating their own poison without any external help and use it on their own weapons. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drow Poison.md\|Drow Poison]] |
| 15 | Choldrith Fur (small pouch) | Choldrith fur is surprisingly light and fluffy, and if one closes their eyes while touching it, they would not be at fault for thinking they were touching a duckling's down. This density is what allows a choldrith to sense tiny vibrations in their webs, and good samples of this fur can help an enterprising adventurer identify these hazards and avoid them.<br /><br />**Use.** You may sprinkle this pouch of fur as an action on any web within 5 feet of you. This fur will vibrate strongly if a creature comes in contact with the web it is sprinkled on. Once this fur has been sprinkled on a web, it cannot be removed. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Mark of Lolth | Just like a drow priestess of Lolth, a choldrith bears the mark of Lolth on its body. If harvested and preserved properly, its powers can be transferred to an amulet that can channel the Spider Goddess' powers, whether she likes it or not. | 40 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drow Amulet (HHHVI).md\|Drow Amulet]] |
