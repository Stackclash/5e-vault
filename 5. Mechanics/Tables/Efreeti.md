| 15 | Tyrant Smoke (vial) | **.** When an efreeti dies, its body disintegrates into a flash of flame and smoke. Fast hands can capture this smoke before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as a material component in many spells. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When casting the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Elemental.md\|conjure elemental]], you may use the tyrant smoke as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead. The spell is also considered to be cast at one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it. The tyrant smoke then becomes inert and useless. | 750 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
