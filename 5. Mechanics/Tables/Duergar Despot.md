# Duergar Despot

| 10 | Duergar Brain | Due to generations of horrific experiments by their illithid captors, all duergars possess a unique genetic mutation that grants them psionic powers. Research from both within and without their own society have come to the conclusion that a large part of this potential is due to certain hormone secretions produced by their brains. When brewed properly, a duergar's brain can become a potion that temporarily grants the drinker psionic abilities of their own. | 5 gp | 3 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Despot Fist | Compared to the beauty of dwarven craftsmanship, duergar tools look as if they were designed by a child with their first art set. That said, what they lack in aesthetics, they more than make up for in utility. For example, the iron fist of a duergar despot somehow manages to be both incredibly hard and extremely lightweight. This is partly possible due to the duergar's psionic ability which it uses to harmonize with and scan their materials as they work. While non-duergar are unable to replicate this craftwork, they are able to take existing pieces and rework them for usage by other species. | 540 gp | 15 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Psychic Engine | In their haste to establish their own cities after their exodus from illithid control, the duergar failed to properly prospect the caves they settled. As such, they are distinctly lacking in access to energy sources like oil and coal to fuel their machines. However, being the pragmatic race they are, the duergar turned instead to their own psionic abilities as an energy source. While it may seem like these engines are thus useless to anyone without the gift of psionics, a skilled alchemist is able to melt down the metal of this engine in order to distill a versatile oil that carries the absorbed psychic energy of the duergar. | 1,125 gp | 40 lb | [[5.
