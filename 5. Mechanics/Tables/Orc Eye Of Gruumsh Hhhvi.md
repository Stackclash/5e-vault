`dice: [[Orc Eye Of Gruumsh Hhhvi.md#^dc-item-description-value-weight-crafting]]`

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Orc Blood (3 vials) | **.** The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatibility with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of exhaustion. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Gruumsh-touched Orc Heart | **.** The heart of an orc touched by Gruumsh is considerably larger than a regular one. Many would find the consumption of this heart to be barbaric, but it would be no more barbaric than what the original owner of this heart has done.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may consume this heart. For the next 10 minutes, you deal an extra `dice: 1d8\|avg` (`1d8`) damage when you hit with a weapon attack. This benefit can not be taken by any character with Elvish ancestry. | 5 gp | 6 lb | — |
| 15 | Orc Eye of Gruumsh | The remaining eye of an orc who has already sacrificed one to their god still carries magical potential. Arcanists and religious scholars would pay a fair price for one of these eyes, to further study the machinations of the evil orcish god. The fact that this eye seems to always glare at anyone with elvish ancestry should probably just be ignored. | 15 gp | 1 lb | — |
