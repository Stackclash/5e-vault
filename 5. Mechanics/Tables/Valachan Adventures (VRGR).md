**Valachan Adventures**

| dice: d8 | Adventure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The Oselo joyously adopt a new member into their community, but the ceremony erupts in strife when Chakuna appears and demands that all newcomers participate in the Trial of Hearts. |
| 2 | Shuaran warriors seek help in slaying a massive [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Saber Toothed Tiger.md|saber-toothed tiger]] killing their people. They don't mention that they recently lost the Cat of Felkovic, a sentient magic item similar to a figurine of wondrous power that conjures a feline killer. |
| 3 | A sapient [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Spider.md|giant spider]] emerges from the caverns known as the Council of the Whip Spider. It demands that the Oselo provide it a sacrifice, or every arachnid in Valachan will attack the village. |
| 4 | The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Tyrannosaurus Rex.md|tyrannosaurus rex]] called Mother Heartless rampages from the Forest of Fossils, incensed by something amiss in her hunting grounds. |
| 5 | The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Lizardfolk.md|lizardfolk]] of the lakes surrounding the Anquara Plateau discover a submerged ruin and unleash an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Aboleth.md|aboleth]] that now holds them in thrall. |
| 6 | Beast-shaped [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Treant.md|treants]] animate and lay siege to Pantara Lodge, obeying Urik von Kharkov's will. |
| 7 | The merchant ship Zodiac runs aground on Kiru Island. The sailors seek help salvaging other shipwrecks and escaping back to seaâ€”preferably before Chakuna notices them. |
| 8 | A pack of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Displacer Beast.md|displacer beasts]] washes up dead in Sangui Cove. An enraged Chakuna prowls the jungle, slaying anyone she suspects of being involved. |
