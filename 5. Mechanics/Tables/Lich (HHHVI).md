| 5 | Lich Dust | A lich's body is as much a part of it as a strand of hair on a normal human. It holds no significant connection to it, and discards it with little fanfare. This is because the lich's true power is located within its phylactery, its body acting as little more than a physical conduit for its actions. When a lich is defeated however, not all of its wicked spirit dissipates immediately. Quick action and powerful magic can bind the errant wisps of a lich's essence, allowing one to craft a trinket to track the lich wherever they may reform. | 3,000 gp | 3 lb | [[5.
