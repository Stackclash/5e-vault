| 10 | Faerie Dragon Blood (vial) | The blood of a faerie dragon is the same bright hue as its scales and also changes as the dragon ages. The blood's inherent magical properties makes it an excellent ink when transcribing spells.<br /><br />**Use.** If you attempt to transcribe a spell into your spellbook or spell scroll that was known to the faerie dragon you harvested this blood from, you may use this vial of blood instead of the regular ink. Doing so halves the regular time it would take to make that transcription, and the cost of the vial of blood is deducted from the total cost of the transcription. | 4 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Faerie Dragon Lungs | Faerie dragons are not altogether harmful, although they boast a number of traits that make them a nuisance to encounter. One such feature is their *euphoria breath*: a gas that temporarily incapacitates a creature that breathes it in. Special bronchioles in the faerie dragon's lungs are responsible for the production of this gas, and still contain traces of it, even after the faerie dragon's death.<br /><br />**Use.** This ability may only be used if the faerie dragon had access to its *euphoria breath* ability at the time of its death. As an action, you may squeeze the faerie dragon's lungs at one creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a `dice:d6\|noform\|avg` (`d6`) at the start of each of its turns to determine its behaviour during the turn. Refer to the *euphoria breath* ability in the faerie dragon's statblock for potential results. | 6 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Faerie Dragon Wing (×2) | The wings of a faerie dragon resemble that of a butterfly in more ways than one. Besides their diaphanous texture, they also possess a light coating of dust that enhances their invisibility magic and aids them in their flight. If harvested undamaged, these wings may be crushed, powdered, and mixed with powdered catalyst gems to enchant objects with flight and invisibility. | 6 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
