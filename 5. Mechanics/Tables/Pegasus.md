*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 86* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Pegasus Hair (small pouch) | Pure white, majestic, and incredibly durable, the hair of a pegasus is coveted as a crafting material. Everything from rope, to instruments, to bows have been strung with pegasus hair, and always sold at a premium. | 2 gp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Pegasus Hoof (×4) | The hooves of a pegasus can be ground down and rendered into a glue like a regular horse's. This glue however has a certain glittery imperfection in it that is actually enjoyed by noble ladies fond of extravagance. This glue has been converted into various cosmetics or as a final flourish to an already decadent gown. | 1 gp | 14 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Travellers Clogs.md\|Traveller's Clogs]] |
| 15 | Pegasus Blood (3 vials) | Pegasus blood is a brilliant sheen of silver with a rainbow reflection on its surface. Well known as a medicine, it is often sold to middle-aged men as a fertility potion. | 4 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Stamina.md\|Potion of Stamina]] |
| 20 | Pegasus Wing (×2) | The glorious wings of a pegasus, resembling two nimbuses on a corporeal body. It takes a very steady hand to remove these fragile appendages without ruining them, but if done correctly, they can be used as ingredients in the ever useful potion of flying. | 10 gp | 35 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Flying.md\|Potion of Flying]] |
