# Stone Golem
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 59* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Golem Core | When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations. | 20 gp | 10 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Golem Stone | Although a stone golem may be defeated, it leaves behind a permanent change to the composition of the stone it was formed from. While still very durable, this stone has a certain flexibility and lightness to it that is unmatched by anything found in nature. This property allows for the crafting of certain items that would otherwise be unfeasible with regular stone. | 300 gp | 25 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/2 Armor.md\|+2 Breastplate]] |
| 20 | Manual Ashes (small pouch) | The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Manual Of Stone Golems.md\|manual of golem creation]] over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation. | 700 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Golem Companion.md\|Golem Companion]] |
