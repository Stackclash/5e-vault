| 20 | Devil Wings (×2) | Like many fiends, Titivilus possesses a pair of wings that grant him flight. And, like many other fiends, these wings do not rely on physics to carry them aloft, but instead rely on magic. When amputated correctly, they can be transformed into the very useful [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|infernal wings]]. | 1,000 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
| — | Tongue of Titivilus | Titivilus is one of the most cunning and deceitful beings in the Nine Hells, an extremely difficult achievement considering the other individuals he has to deal with. Capable of misleading even the other archdevils, Titivilus has perhaps the fastest tongue in the whole multiverse. Long have his enemies yearned to cut that tongue from his mouth and craft it into an instrument that will have their own foes dancing to their tune. | — | 1 lb | [[5.
