| 20 | Grimlock Brain | Grimlocks are a pathetic race, descendent from humans craven enough to worship the illithid race as deities. That said, their wretchedness can still prove useful to the rest of us. Generations of exposure to the illithid's experiments and influence has produced a permanent physiological change in the brain of the grimlock that when brewed into a potion, can provide some level of immunity to the abilities of the mind flayers. | 5 gp | 4 lb | Potion of Mindflayer Resistance |
