| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Neothelid Tentacle (×2) | A neothelid tentacle is a bizarre mockery of that of an illithid's. Although similar in many ways, they possess a duct that allows digestive enzymes to be passed out and onto enemies. This duct is of course useless once the tentacle has been removed from the neothelid's stomach, but the tentacle itself still serves as a good weapon base. | 25 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/2 Weapon.md\|+2 Whip]] |
| 10 | Neothelid Enzyme Sack | The highly acidic contents of a neothelid's digestive tract are capable of melting through metal and flesh alike. Strangely enough however, it is completely unreactive when it comes into contact with brain matter. While this does allow the neothelid to consume their prey's brains intact, it does beg the question of how they actually end up digesting them once they've been swallowed.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may throw this sack at a point you can see within 20 feet of you, bursting on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:10d6\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`10d6`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | 100 gp | 12 lb | — |
| 15 | Neothelid Brain | A neothelid's brain is pitiful in many ways. While it once held the potential for vast intelligence, it has become extremely limited due to its unnatural growth. Its psionic abilities however are still extremely powerful and are unchecked by any semblance of reason or strategy from the creature. In many ways, the neothelid is simply a tortured creature, given power it cannot control and perhaps does not even want. When used by an experienced spellcaster however, this power can be given direction and wielded with much greater purpose.<br /><br />**Use.** When you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell, you may use this brain instead of the spell's usual material component. If you do so, instead of rolling `dice:1d10\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`d10`) at the start of an affected creature's turn to determine their behavior, you may choose the result instead. | 285 gp | 18 lb | — |
| 20 | Neothelid Hide | Neothelid skin is notoriously difficult to harvest, sloughing off and melting quickly upon their deaths due to the reaction of their spilled digestive enzymes with their body mucus. If you do manage to harvest some however, their skin has natural protections against both magic and psionics, and has been adapted into wondrous armors and protective gear. | 555 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Doublet Of Psionic Protection (HHHVII).md\|Doublet of Psionic Protection]] |
| 25 | Neothelid Hook | As a tadpole, a neothelid would have possessed a hook on the end of its tail to embed itself into the brain of its unlucky host. As a neothelid of course, it no longer needs to do this, and its vestigial hook has grown little in comparison to the rest of its body. Still, the hook possesses some magical ability and when turned into a weapon and applied properly, can be just as debilitating as it once would have been when used on a hapless victim. | 1,750 gp | 18 lb | Mind Hook |
