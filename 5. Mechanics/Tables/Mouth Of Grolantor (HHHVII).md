| 10 | Lock of Hill Giant Hair | Resembling the brush on the top of a barren hill, the hair of a hill giant is considered a valuable resource to leatherworkers. The hair of a hill giant, while unpleasent to the touch, makes for a good rope material and even the hill giants themselves use it to stitch their clothes together. | 20 gp | 10 lb | — |
| 15 | Hill Giant Fingernail | Like all giants, the fingernail of the hill giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Giant Strength (DMG).md\|potion of giant strength]]. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot. | 30 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Hill Giant Strength.md\|Potion of Hill Giant Strength]] |
| 25 | Mouth of Grolantor Bile (vial) | The stomach of a hill giant is a remarkable thing, able to digest and handle just about anything. As such, it is a particular point of interest in the rare case that something actually does manage to give it indigestion. The hill giants believe that it is a portent of their god Grolantor, while scholars say it is just a stomach flu. Either way, the hill giant's stomach reacts by producing special enzymes that attempt to cure the giant, but when digested also send them quite mad. While it may be pitiful for the giant, this bile can become especially useful if one manages to get their hands on it, as its uses in magic is quite potent. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial (HHHVI).md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell, you may use this vial of bile instead of the spell's usual material components. If you do so, whenever a creature that is under the effects of your [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell rolls a `dice:d10\|noform\|avg` (`d10`) to determine their behavior, you may choose to have them reroll their `dice:d10\|noform\|avg` (`d10`) and you may then pick between the two results. Using the bile in this way does not consume it, and you may reuse it as many times as you wish. | 180 gp | 2 lb | — |
