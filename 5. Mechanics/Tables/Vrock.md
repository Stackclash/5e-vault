# Vrock
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 26* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Vrock Feathers (small bundle) | Black as the night and twice as scary. While they make for a macabre flourish to one's outfit at a costume party, they aren't useful for much else. | 10 gp | 2 lb | — |
| 10 | Vrock Talon (×2) | The talons of a vrock are incredibly sharp, easily capable of rending through armor like a scythe through dry grass. When fashioned into a set of daggers, they can make one a cut above the rest in a fight. | 16 gp | 10 lb | [+1 Dagger](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) |
| 15 | Vrock Vocal Cords | The terrifying screech of a vrock is capable of stunning creatures with its piercing volume. While a removed vrock's vocal cords are unable to create the same effect, a good tinker can use them for a slightly different diabolical purpose. | 40 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Demon Music Box.md\|Demon Music Box]] |
| 20 | Vrock Spores (vial) | **.** The collected spores of a vrock, requiring a special collection process and preservation in oil to ensure they retain their potency even after the original owner's death.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the spores takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, the coated item is considered magical and any creature successfully hit by this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]]. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, a target takes `dice: 1d10\|avg` (`1d10`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Holy Water Flask.md\|vial of holy water]] on the target also ends the effect on it. | 50 gp | 1 lb | — |
