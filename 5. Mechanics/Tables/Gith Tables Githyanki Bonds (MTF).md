| 1 | There is no greater duty than to serve the Revered Queen. |
| 2 | Humanity thrives only because we conquered the illithids. Therefore, what is theirs is ours. |
| 3 | Without battle, life has no purpose. |
| 4 | Life is but a spark in the dark. We all go dark, but those who dare can burn bright. |
