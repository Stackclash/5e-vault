| Personality Traits |
|--------------------|
| I am often covered in blood and viscera, which other people find off-putting. |
| I am obsessed with self-sufficiency; anything I wear must have come from something I harvested. |
| I revere plants as both friends and benefactors, and I always give them the respect they deserve. |
| I say a small prayer before harvesting a fresh kill, thanking it for its sacrifice. |
| dice: d6 | Personality Trait |
| I see no moral issue about harvesting any once-living creature, even if they were clearly sentient. "Waste not, want not", after all. |
| I always have a nice flower or scented pouch of leaves in my possession to give to those I like. |
| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
| The hunt is what excites me more than anything. Harvesting is just how I keep mementos of my prey. |
| I am fascinated with the deadly nature of some plants and I look forward to seeing how I can put them to use. |
| I have a myriad of harvested trophies from rare game which I show off whenever possible. |
| I often unnerve people with my discussions of the more disgusting aspects of creature anatomy. |
| If no one stops me, I will talk for hours about plant facts and my favourite herbs. |
| I will collect every pretty flower I seeâ€”and I think every flower is pretty. |
| I insist on using every little bit of what I kill, it would be an insult to that creature's life otherwise. |
| I adorn everything I own with flowers and other plant life. |
