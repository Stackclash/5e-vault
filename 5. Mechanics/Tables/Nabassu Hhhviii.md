| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Nabassu Claw (×2) | Black-tipped and able to rend both flesh and spirit, the nabassu claw is one of the most perfect natural weapons formed within the Abyss. It is said that weaponry formed from these claws quiver with excitement in the hands of their wielder as they prepare to take a mortal life. | 250 gp | 10 lb | +2 Melee Slashing Weapon |
| 15 | Demon Wing (×2) | Like many fiends, the dark wings of the nabassu possess an inherent magic that holds its form aloft instead of relying on physical forces. And, like many fiends, these wings can be harvested to form the basis of the ever-useful: [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings Hhhvi.md\|infernal wings]]. | 300 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings Hhhvi.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
| 15 | Nabassu Hide | The hide of a nabassu is as dark as a moonless night and tougher than castleforged steel. Not only that, but it is capable of emitting a demonic aura around itself that literally smothers the light around it, allowing the nabassu to shroud itself constantly in a cloak of shadows. This has led to many tales of legendary thieves that ascribe their supernatural stealth to suits of pitch black nabassu hide. | 600 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Suit Of Shadows Hhhviii.md\|Suit of Shadows]] |
| 20 | Nabassu Jaw | If there is one thing that a nabassu is famous for, it is their devouring of mortal souls. Such a terrible action requires a very specific set of adaptations, and the jaw of the nabassu can be found to be lined with tiny Abyssal runes that disintegrate any spiritual form that enters them. | 1,700 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Soul Cleaver Hhhviii.md\|Soul Cleaver]] |
| 25 | Nabassu Eye (×2) | Beyond its razor sharp claws and fangs, the most dangerous body part of a nabassu is in fact its eyes. These glowing orbs are capable of stealing the soul of whomever they gaze upon and in fact are said to be the inspiration for the infamous soul gems used by demiliches to protect their lairs. | 2,500 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lifestealers Mask Hhhviii.md\|Lifestealer's Mask]] |
