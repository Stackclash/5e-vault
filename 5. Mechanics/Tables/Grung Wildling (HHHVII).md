| 10 | Grung Poison Gland | Unfortunately, the poison of a grung is neutralized shortly after being harvested and is thus effectively useless. The poison gland however still possesses trace enzymes and chemicals that create a mild hallucinogenic when brewed long enough. Some yuan-ti tribes that live near grung tribes have been found with clay pots full of this hallucinogenic drink, ostensibly for ceremonial purposes. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
