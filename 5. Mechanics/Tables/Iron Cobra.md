# Iron Cobra
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 13* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gnome-made Servo | The internal mechanisms of the clockwork constructs can seem almost like magic for anyone not trained in the tinkering and gnomish sciences. While they may vary from model to model (and indeed, even among the same type of clockwork), they all share the same design for the core set of gears that power its lifelike movements. Tinkers of all breeds value these mastercrafted servos to use in their own creations, and will pay a decent price to avoid having to make them on their own. | 1 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Ironleather Hide | As implied by their name, the iron cobra is covered in a thick hide of iron plates. However, in order to replicate the articulation of a real cobra, gnomish tinkers mastered a smelting process to create an alloy that flexes and moves like real skin. Taking it back to an experienced blacksmith allows it to be repurposed into a comfortable and surprisingly lightweight armor that does not sacrifice protection. | 30 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ironleather Splint.md\|Ironleather Splint]] |
| 20 | Artificial Venom (vial) | **.** Much like a real cobra, the iron cobra's fangs are loaded with deadly venom to inject into its victims. However, in the classic gnome habit of overcomplicating their work, the iron cobra is also loaded with other more nefarious concoctions not found in nature.<br /><br />**Use.** When you harvest this material, you receive a random venom that imposes the same effect as one of the poison effects listed under the iron cobra's *bite* ability. All venoms can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the venom takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of the appropriate venom. | 100 gp | 1 lb | — |
