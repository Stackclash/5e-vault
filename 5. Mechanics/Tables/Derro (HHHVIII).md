| 10 | Derro Brain | They say in the Underdark, "talk to four derros and you will find five psychoses." Indeed, the derro are among the more peculiar of the races to be found in the subterranean realm, and absolutely none of them have displayed behavior that could be considered "sane" by our standards. That is not to say that they are invalids, however. In fact, their so-called "madness" has served them well in keeping them alive in their hostile environment, really raising the question of what true madness even means. Either way, their eccentricities leads to their brains all being shaped differently, much like the unique patterns of a snowflake. For the more morbid academics, derro brains provide invaluable research into the nature of psychology, and thus can be sold for a tidy sum. | 5 sp | 2 lb | â€” |
