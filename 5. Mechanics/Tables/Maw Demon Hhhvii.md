`dice: [[Maw Demon Hhhvii.md#^dc-item-description-value-weight-crafting]]`

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Maw Demon Teeth (large bag) | These jagged, uneven teeth are incredibly sharp and capable of rending meat from bone easier than a hot knife through butter. The nefarious magic in them make them wonderful materials for a morbidly amusing little trinket. | 1 gp | 7 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Portable Mouth Hhhvii.md\|Portable Mouth]] |
| 15 | Maw Demon Stomach | **.** The unholy stomach of a maw demon actually doubles as a portal to the Abyss, usually leading directly to Yeenoghu's gullet. With only some slight alteration however, this stomach can be properly harvested and treated to act as a slightly different conduit for lesser demons.<br /><br />**Use.** If you cast the summon lesser demons spell, you may expend this item instead of its usual material component. If you do, the CR limits of the summoned demons specified in the spell are doubled. | 4 gp | 12 lb | â€” |
