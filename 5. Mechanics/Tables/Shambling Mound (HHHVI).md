# Shambling Mound
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 93* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Shambling Mound Mulch (small pouch ×2) | The decaying biomass that would have once fed the shambling mound is forever changed by its exposure to the powerful plant creature. It is a fantastic fertiliser and herbal remedy causing it to be coveted by both gardeners and healers. | 12 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Superior Healing.md\|Potion of Superior Healing]] |
| 15 | Shambling Mound Vine (×4) | The lightning that created the shambling mound also causes it to have a resistance to that element. As the shambling mound adds more biomass to its body, it spreads this property to them as well. Intact samples of these can be taken and crafted into a truly unique set of vestments that can boast the same lightning absorbing abilities. | 15 gp | 11 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Vine Tunic (HHHVI).md\|Vine Tunic]] |
| 20 | Root-stem | The root-stem of the shambling mound is actually the entirety of its being in the same way that a humanoid's brain is the entirety of theirs. It is prized in medicine for its regenerative properties and at the same time prized in necromantic schools for its decaying and consuming properties. | 110 gp | 8 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of The Undergrowth (HHHVI).md\|Wand of the Undergrowth]] |
