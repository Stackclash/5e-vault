# Kobold Dragonshield
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 28* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Kobold Teeth (small pouch) | Like a crocodile, kobolds continuously grow and lose teeth throughout their lives. As such, their jaws tend to be lined with razor sharp rows of fresh pearly-whites. Kobolds use these for tools and there is no reason why other races should refuse to do the same if the opportunity presented itself. | 8 cp | 3 lb | — |
| 10 | Kobold Dragonshield Heart | A kobold that bears the title of dragonshield is one that has been raised by a draconic patron to the heights of kobold potential (admittedly still not much of an achievement). Their hearts bear slight mutations that add extra adrenaline in times of stress, allowing them to push on when other kobolds would falter (again, not that impressive of an achievement).<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may eat this heart or feed it to a willing ally. If the eater is suffering from a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralysis]] effect that would allow a saving throw to end it, they may immediately attempt that saving throw at advantage. | 3 gp | 1 lb | — |
