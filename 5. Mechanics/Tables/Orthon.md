| 15 | Orthon Tusk (×2) | **.** Aside from being incredibly intimidating, the tusks of an orthon serve a practical purpose in their tracking duties. The orthon is capable of attuning their tusks to their quarry, causing them to vibrate like dowsing rods as they approach. While it is impossible to replicate this ability once the tusks have been removed from their skull, they can be used in a one-time ritual in order to track a particularly elusive target.<br /><br />**Use.** If you grind an orthon tusk into a fine powder, you may burn it along with a possession or piece of a creature you wish to track in order to designate them as your quarry for the next 24 hours. Once a creature has been designated as your quarry, you become constantly aware of their distance and direction from you so long as they are on the same plane of existence as you. Any magical effect that disrupts divination magic will also disrupt this effect. | 70 gp | 6 lb | — |
| 20 | Orthon Eye (×2) | Orthons are some of the most prodigious trackers that have ever graced the multiverse. This is in no small part due to their extraordinary senses. In particular, their eyes are capable of seeing across multiple spectrums and through magical obfuscation. By transforming these eyes into lenses, the wearer can also gain the honed sight and tracking ability of the orthon. | 430 gp | 1 lb | [[5.

| 25 | Orthon Hide | Despite their massive size, the orthon is notable for their ability to sneak up on their targets with ease. This is due to their unique skin that is capable of true invisibility greater than the simple camouflage or displacement of lesser creatures. As such, these hides are highly prized as a leather base for making magical equipment for those that are stealthily inclined. | 1,650 gp | 30 lb | [[5.
