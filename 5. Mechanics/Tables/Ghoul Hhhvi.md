| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Ghoul Claws (Ã—2) | The claws of the ghoul are well known for their paralysing touch, and there are many a horror story of adventurers devoured alive by a ghast while they could do nothing but lie there helpless (of course one has to wonder how this story could be true if they are alive to tell it, but I digress.) | 10 gp | 6 lb | Paralysing Dust |
| 20 | Ghoul Hide | Despite its undead nature, a ghoul does not rot or decompose. While this only adds to its unnerving nature, its skin does have certain properties useful for a harvester. Some of the original designs for the renowned bag of colding used ghoul hide as its main material. | 40 gp | 12 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Colding Hhhvi.md\|Bag of Colding]] |
