# Lizardfolk Shaman
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 72* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Lizardfolk Teeth (small pouch) | Like an alligator, lizardfolk continuously grow and lose teeth over time. They are not above turning these useful pieces of ivory into tools and weaponry, and indeed, there is no reason why the rest of us shouldn't either. | 8 cp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Lizardfolk Hide | Lizardfolk hide is already about as strong as leather and can withstand cuts and blows that most humanoids would find lethal. These hides can be tanned just like any other reptiles, with the added advantage that it is already in the right configuration for a humanoid to wear. | 1 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Studded Leather Armor.md\|Studded Leather Armor]] |
| 15 | Shamanic Ridge | The shamans of a lizardfolk tribe are easy to spot. They sport a distinctive spiked ridge starting from the crown of their skull down to the base of their tail. This ridge is considered to be a gift from their god, and is the source of their shamanic powers.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may invoke the powers within this ridge to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Polymorph.md\|polymorph]] spell on yourself. The animal form you choose when casting [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Polymorph.md\|polymorph]] in this way must be a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Crocodile.md\|crocodile]]. Once used, this item loses its magical properties and becomes effectively useless. | 6 gp | 10 lb | — |
