# Shield Guardian
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 93* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Shield Guardian Breastplate | The breastplate of a shield guardian forms the structural basis for the rest of its form. Even if it is removed and refashioned, it can still communicate with the amulet of the original shield guardian, thus making it prime material for certain pieces of equipment. | 50 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Armor Of The Guardian (HHHVI).md\|Armor of the Guardian]] |
| 20 | Spell Storing Plate | The same magical framework that allows a shield guardian to store a spell is the same as that used in the famous ring of spell storing. If this plate is harvested properly, it can be refashioned into its much stronger counterpart. | 200 gp | 5 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Spell Storing.md\|Ring of Spell Storing]] |
