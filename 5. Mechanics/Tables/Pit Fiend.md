# Pit Fiend
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 30* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Pit Fiend Blood (5 vials) | A pit fiend's blood hisses, boils, and bubbles long after it has been removed from its body, as if the fiend's wrath at its enemies continues even after its death. Cooling this blood and separating out the plasma can create a potion that grants the drinker the same unholy vitality of its original owner. | 160 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Infernal Vitality.md\|Potion of Infernal Vitality]] |
| 10 | Pit Fiend Venom (3 vials) | **.** A pit fiend's venom is one of the most insidious of all the fiends. Besides the horrible pain they inflict on their victim, its corrupting influence even blocks out magical assistance, keeping wounds open and bleeding even in the face of divine help.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to up to 15 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or 1 slashing or piercing weapon for 1 hour. Applying takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]]. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes `dice: 6d6\|avg` (`6d6`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. | 300 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Pit Fiend Claw (×2) | For many hapless adventurers, a pit fiend's claw is the last thing they ever see. If reforged into a weapon however, it may be the last thing your enemies ever see. | 1,600 gp | 20 lb | [+3 Halberd](compendium/items/3-weapon.md) |
| 20 | Devil Wing (×2) | The mighty wings of the pit fiend are among the finest of all the devils. Massive canvases capable of cloaking even the pit fiend's massive frame, they make for the ideal material to craft a pair of infernal wings. | 2,000 gp | 30 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Infernal Wings.md\|Infernal Wings]] |
| 25 | Pit Fiend Head | A pit fiend is one of the most terrifying beings in the entire multiverse. As such, it stands to reason that anybody that is wearing the severed head of a pit fiend as a helmet should be considered even more terrifying. Indeed, if one can detach this fiend's head from its body, haul it back to an artificer for reforging, and then wear it proudly despite knowing the retribution that they may face from those that pit fiend considered its ally; that person rightfully deserves to be feared by the lessers around them. | 18,000 gp | 35 lb | [[5.
