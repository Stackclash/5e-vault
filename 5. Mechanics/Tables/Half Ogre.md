# Half-Ogre
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 81* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Half-Ogre Blood (5 vials) | The blood of a regular ogre is too foreign and extreme to be compatible with that of a humanoid's system. A half-ogre on the other hand has the perfect dilution of humanoid blood for it to not be toxic to a humanoid, while still conferring the power of its giant progenitor. | 5 sp | 1 lb | [[5.
