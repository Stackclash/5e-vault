| 5 | Zombie Juice (vial) | An absolutley putrid collection of drippings and fluids from a reanimated corpse. While it smells awful, the necromantic magic in it allows it to act as a powerful preservation agent. Fittingly, necromancers use this very juice to keep their more valuable experiments fresh, often farming lesser zombies for more of this chemical. | 3 cp | 1 lb | â€” |
