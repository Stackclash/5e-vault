# Alkilith
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 19*

| 15 | Alkilith Acid (vial) | The strength of an alkilith is lackluster compared to other more ferocious demons. As such, instead of bludgeoning or slashing their victims to death, the alkilith prefers to coat its foes in a potent acid that eats flesh and metal alike. The acid unfortunately loses much of its potency quickly after the death of the alkilith, but is still very useful for various cultists that use it to clean demonic artifacts. | 270 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 20 | Alkilith Spore (vial) | **.** Like many of the more mundane forms of mold and fungus, the presence of an alkilith can wreak havoc on a creature's health due to the inhalation of tiny spores. However, the alkilith's effect is much faster acting and much more insidious as it causes a madness to take hold that starts as a buzzing in the mind and devolves rapidly into a rabid violence against friend and foe alike. These spores remain active after the death of the alkilith and although they dissipate quickly after exposure to the open air, they can be used to brew a particularly noxious alcohol that can stir even the most serene pacifist to wanton violence.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may either uncork this vial or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Either way, all creatures within 30 feet of the exposed spores must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or hear a faint buzzing in their head and have disadvantage on their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. If the saving throw failed by 5 or more, the creature is instead subjected to the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). Once exposed to the open air for one turn, these spores dissipate and become useless. | 570 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Berserker Brew.md\|Berserker Brew]] |
| 25 | Alkilith Pus (vial) | **.** The oozing innards of an alkilith is its strongest connection to its previous life as an offshoot of the demon prince Jubilex. Composed of foul, unholy miasmas, the alkilith drips fine trails of this pus wherever it goes and is the primary material for transforming an ordinary doorway into a portal to the Abyss. It is very difficult to collect this pus before its magical properties dissipate, but when done so, can also be used as a quick means of Abyssal travel (why you would want to go there however, is beyond me). **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** If you spread this pus around the sides of an open aperture and leave it undisturbed for 10 minutes, that aperture becomes attuned to the Abyss and transforms into a portal to that realm. The portal becomes anchored to a random unoccupied space in the Abyss, and travelling through the portal transports you and anything you are carrying to that plane as if you were stepping through a doorway. This vial has enough pus to cover 30 feet of perimeter. An aperture's perimeter must be fully enclosed for it to become a portal to the Abyss. | 3,000 gp | 1 lb | — |
