| 10 | Gibbering Mouther Teeth (small pouch) | The assorted teeth of the gibbering mouther is a literal mixed bag of tusks, fangs, and chompers from all the creatures that the mouther has devoured. These teeth hold little value above what a normal set of teeth would fetch, but some people with interest in aberrants collect these out of a morbid curiosity. | 1 gp | 8 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Mouther Spittle (vial) | **.** The spittle of the gibbering mouther is a bizarre melange of the digestive enzymes of every single creature that it has devoured. By a cruel act of nature, this hazardous mixture reacts with air and can subsequently blind any creature unlucky enough to be caught in its radius.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be thrown at a point within 15 feet, with the vial exploding on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of the explosion must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [[/5.
