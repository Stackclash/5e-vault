| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Shadow Robe Wisps (vial) | As a reflection of its malformed existence, a boneclaw garbs itself in a shadowy substance in a pale imitation of the grand finery found on real liches. While not nearly as regal, the shadows do possess some trace of the boneclaw's magic and thus are useful for all manners of alchemy and dark magic. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial Hhhvi.md\|enchanted vial]].** | 300 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shadow Robe Hhhviii.md\|Shadow Robe]] |
| 20 | Bone Claw (Ã—2) | Rather than favoring the dark magic synonymous with liches, a boneclaw utilizes the more mundane, but no less intimidating, eponymous bone claws. Perfectly shaped to reach, rend, and restrain hapless victims, these claws make fantastic weapons for trapping and finishing off wounded opponents. | 325 gp | 25 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Deaths Grip Hhhviii.md\|Death's Grip]] |
| 25 | Boneclaw Skull | Although it is imperfect, a boneclaw still possesses a phylactery like a real lich; or it is more accurate to say that the phylactery possesses it. In a mockery of their failure to perform the ritual correctly, a boneclaw is indentured to a mortal creature who serves as the boneclaw's phylactery. So long as the creature lives, so does the boneclaw. It is not always clear who acts as the boneclaw's phylactery, sometimes not even to the boneclaw itself. To circumvent this, certain enchantments can be performed on a well preserved boneclaw head, allowing one to track down the living phylactery and end the menace of the boneclaw, once and for all. | 2,000 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
