| 5 | Satyr Hair (small pouch) | A satyr's covering of thick lustrous fur is as much one of its trademarks as its horns. This hair is so thick in fact, that when brewed into a tonic, it can help regrow the hair of others. | 1 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hair Tonic.md\|Hair Tonic]] |
| 10 | Satyr Horn (×2) | As satyrs are known for inducing feelings of hedonism and excess, it is fitting that certain parts of their body carry the same properties even in death. When ground up and mixed into a paste, satyr horns have been known to carry a strong intoxicating and aphrodisiac effect. This has caused some naive satyrs to become the main event of an unscrupulous lord's party in a way they probably weren't expecting. | 1 gp | 6 lb | — |
