*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 94* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Bone Dust (small pouch) | A skeleton touched by foul necromancy is forever changed in ways that transcend the physical. Dust from the bones of a raised skeleton continues to carry foul necromantic energies that can be recycled into other necromantic purposes and rituals. After all, necromancers are not known to waste anything. | 8 cp | 3 lb | — |
| 15 | Minotaur Horn (×2) | The wicked horns of the minotaur have ended more than one hapless adventurer's life. When mounted on a sturdy helm, and with slight magical reinforcement, a wearer can emulate the deadly charge of the horns' original owner. | 10 gp | 20 lb | [[5.
