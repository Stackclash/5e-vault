| 10 | Vegepygmy Frill | Due to their bizarre origins, vegepygmy physiology can vary widely from specimen to specimen. While some may closely resemble humanoids with soft grey skin, others may appear more monstrous with twisted appendages and bulging green orbs for eyes. That said, there is one attribute that they all share, which is their frill. Its exact location on the vegepygmy's body can vary widely, but it is responsible for producing the vegepygmy's spores, as well as regulating air and moisture intake. By itself it is not worth much, but dried versions of it are used in some medical schools as a treatment for respiratory problems. | 2 gp | 4 lb | â€” |
