| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Undertaker Oil (5 vials) | Just like any machine, the cadaver collector requires lubricant to keep its gears and joints moving smoothly. The cadaver collector however uses a more vile source: the blood and gristle of rotting corpses. As the grisly mixture covers and circulates through the infernal construct, it catalyzes into a substance known as undertaker oil. This oil is highly sought for its ability to preserve corpses regardless of their level of putrefaction, and can be used by anyone to rival the skills of even the greatest embalmer. | 40 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Cadaver Collector Face Plate | Those that have fought a cadaver collector and lived will agree that although the corpses that adorn its body are terrifying, the thing that lingers in the mind for years after is its hollow, unblinking visage. Stylized to resemble a horrific green-eyed skull, the face of the cadaver collector inspires paralyzing fear in both the living and the dead (a trait it shares with my great-uncle Tothbard). | 460 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Death Mask Hhhviii.md\|Death Mask]] |
| 20 | Acheron Steel | Forged from the hell-blasted flames of Acheron, the steel plates that cover the cadaver collector put to shame anything smelted on the Material Planes. With proper modifications, this steel creates a fearsome suit of armor that protects both the body and the spirit. | 1,500 gp | 80 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Necroplate Hhhviii.md\|Necroplate]] |
| 25 | Ghostfire Engine | **.** In the center of the cadaver collector beats not a heart, but a small, white-hot core of hellish energy that fuels the dark construct. This core is sparked by the sacrifice of dozens of innocent creatures and drives the collector to its dark purpose. It must be handled with extreme care, but when preserved well, its energy can be reused as a very powerful explosive or for particularly difficult crafting purposes.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw this item to a space within 15 feet, after which, this item explodes in a 10-foot radius burst. All targets within that burst must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they suffer `dice: 4d6\|avg` (`4d6`) fire damage and `dice: 4d6\|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage, or half that on a success. | 5,300 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
