| 10 | Duergar Brain | Due to generations of horrific experiments by their illithid captors, all duergars possess a unique genetic mutation that grants them psionic powers. Research from both within and without their own society have come to the conclusion that a large part of this potential is due to certain hormone secretions produced by their brains. When brewed properly, a duergar's brain can become a potion that temporarily grants the drinker psionic abilities of their own. | 5 gp | 3 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Rider Pheromones (vial) | The duergar's mount of choice is the insectoid creature known as the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Male Steeder (MPMM).md\|steeder]]. It is a well known practice that duergar raise the steeders from birth in order to properly acclimate them to their presence and ensure their loyalty. These steeders undergo physiological changes that results in lower levels of aggression and higher co-operation. Less well known however, is the fact that duergar riders actually develop physiological changes as well; their psionic abilities mutating their bodies to increase production of a pheromone that steeders find soothing. This pheromone has a wide variety of uses beyond steeder rearing however, and can fetch a decent price when sold to alchemists.<br /><br />**Use.** You may rub this vial of pheromones over yourself to gain advantage on Wisdom ([[/5.
