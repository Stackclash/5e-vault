# Grymclover Forests; Grymclover Navigation DCs
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 278* 

Finding your way through a forest that's been mutated like this is exceptionally difficult due to the dense brambles, thick canopy, and low visibility. When a character makes a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check to navigate to a specific location within the forest, consult the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Grymclover Forests Grymclover Navigation Dcs (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Grymclover Navigation DCs]] table. On a failed check, they become lost and suffer a setback determined by the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Grymclover Forests Becoming Lost (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Becoming Lost]] table.

| DC | Location |
|----|----------|
| 15 | A location on the outskirts of the wood, or near a larger settlement |
| 20 | A location near the center of the forest or steeped in Corruption, like most dungeons and ruins are |
| 25 | A location that is lost or hidden, such as a portal to the Fey or Shadow planes, a secret settlement, or a magically cloaked dungeon or ruin |
