# Grymclover Forests; Corrupted Foraged Food and Drink
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 278* 

The adverse effects that cause a grymclover forest to emerge provide additional danger by corrupting sources of clean water and food. A foraging character makes a DC 15 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check. There's a 50 percent chance that any food or water found in these forests has been corrupted. A DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Nature\|Nature]]) or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Poison And Disease.md\|detect poison and disease]] spell reveals if any foraged food or water has been corrupted. A creature that ingests corrupted food or water in this way must roll on the Corrupted Foraged Food and Drink table.
