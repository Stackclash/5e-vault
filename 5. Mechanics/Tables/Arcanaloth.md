# Arcanaloth
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 110* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Arcanaloth Ichor (vial) | **.** The ichor of an arcanaloth is the most valuable of all yugoloth ichors, being steeped in the knowledge and magic of the original arcanaloth. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin writing with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known to the arcanaloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any wizard spell from the arcanaloth's known spell list that is of a level for which you have spell slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a traditional manner. | 100 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Arcanaloth Poison (vial) | **.** Despite their learned and sophisticated nature, an arcanaloth is more than capable of killing a mortal in close combat as they are using their spells. This is partly in thanks to the poison glands they possess under their claws, which add a touch of death to their razor sharp strikes.<br /><br />**Use.** Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d6\|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw. | 300 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Arcanaloth Tail | **.** The tricky arcanaloth has a tendency to sneak into places it does not belong, aided by its inherent ability to shapeshift and turn invisible. Part of this magic is kept in their tail, which can be spotted twitching before they use any of their deceptive abilitites.<br /><br />**Use.** This tail has 3 charges. While holding this tail you may spend 1 charge to use the tail to cast the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Alter Self.md\|alter self]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md\|invisibility]] (self only). Once this tail loses all charges, it dissolves into a useless black ichor. | 500 gp | 9 lb | — |
| 20 | Yugoloth Heart | Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim. | 750 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Gem Of Teleportation.md\|Gem of Teleportation]] |
