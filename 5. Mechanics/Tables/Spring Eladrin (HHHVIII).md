| 10 | Spring Blood (3 vials) | The blood of an eladrin in its spring form smells like fresh roses and flows like nectar. It has an energizing, almost intoxicating presence, and for this reason, eladrin have been known to add drops of their own blood to the wine they offer unaware travelers. For this reason, it is best to avoid drinking or eating anything that an eladrin offers to you (but really, this is a good rule to follow in the Feywild in general).<br /><br />**Use.** If a creature drinks this vial of this blood, for the next hour that creature automatically fails any saving throw against any effect that would result in them becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]]. This blood is tasteless and odorless once added to any other liquid, but retains its dark-red coloring. | 60 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Eladrin Heart | The emotions of an eladrin are more intense and passionate than most mortals could ever comprehend. In fact, from my interviews with the eladrin, I could only describe their feelings as the most pure expression of emotion capable, one untainted by mundane desires and influences. These feelings are so strong that they are even capable of altering the eladrin's physical form and are kept (where else): the heart. If you want to tap into such a primal force, you must be prepared to remove the heart of these creatures, perhaps in doing so, proving why you need an emotional aid in the first place. | 540 gp | 2 lb | [[5.
