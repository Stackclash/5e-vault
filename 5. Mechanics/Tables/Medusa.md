# Medusa
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 74* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Medusa Hair (bundle) | The living snakes of a medusa die once their host does. Harvesting them intact, however, can make for very dangerous whip tails that deliver deadly poisons with each lash. | 25 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Medusa Whip.md\|Medusa Whip]] |
| 15 | Medusa Heart | The heart of a medusa is a sad one. Cursed by their own vanity, a sense of loneliness and regret seems to seep from these hearts. When used in a dark ritual, these hearts can serve as the core reagent for cursing an item with the same uncontrollable vanity of its original host. | 50 gp | 3 lb | Curse of Vanity |
| 20 | Medusa Head | **.** The notorious visage of a medusa transforms any creature that gazes upon it to stone. This property persists even into its death, and unfortunate adventurers can find themselves accidentally petrified when they go to inspect their kill. Even though the idea may be macabre, the preserved head of a medusa can be attached to equipment to petrify any that gaze upon it.<br /><br />**Use.** The head of the medusa carries the same petrifying gaze ability as listed in the statblock of the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Medusa.md\|medusa]], with the exception that the head cannot petrify itself. | 130 gp | 10 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Medusa Helm.md\|Medusa Helm]] |
