# The Lonely
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 63* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Lonely Blood (3 vials) | **.** The black ichor that flows through the lonely's veins seems to yearn for those around it; sticking relentlessly to whatever it touches and never letting go. It takes a powerful throat to manage to swallow such a thick ooze, and an even stronger constitution to do so unharmed. It does, however, contain many benefits for whoever manages to do so and helps one to really appreciate the company of those around them. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Enchanted Vial.md\|enchanted vial]].**<br /><br />**Use.** You may drink this blood as an action. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on attack rolls while you are within 30 feet of at least two other creatures. You otherwise have disadvantage on attack rolls. | 25 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Harpoon Arm (×2) | The lonely carries two deadly harpoons designed to reel in their prey and grapple them in a twisted embrace. These harpoons are considerably stronger than the average whaler's harpoon, however, and can be turned into a fine weapon that inverts the lonely's magical signature and actually keeps your foes away from you. | 95 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance Of Isolation.md\|Lance of Isolation]] |
| 20 | Primal Loneliness | **.** The sorrowsworn are beings of pure emotion, spawned from the collective psyche of the Shadowfell itself. After their corporeal forms have been slain, this emotion leaks back into its home plane, unless captured first by a harvester skilled with their [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]]. Whenever this emotion is released, it will then embody the closest creature to it, temporarily granting a myriad of abilities depending on the sorrowsworn. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper.md\|spirit paper]].**<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may tear this item open, releasing the loneliness inside to possess the nearest living creature for the next 10 minutes. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a creature possessed by loneliness must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 2d6\|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage. | 450 gp | 1 lb | — |
