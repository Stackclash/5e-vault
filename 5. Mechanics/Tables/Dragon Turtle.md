| 10 | Dragon Turtle Blood (1,000 gallons) | An old sailor's adage held that the dragon turtle was the king of the ocean and that no denizen of the deeps would dare to approach them without permission. As such, it became a common good luck ritual to mix dragon turtle blood with tar and coat important ships with it. Later research found that this ritual was more than just a folk tale and that certain aquatic creatures have developed an instinctual revulsion when they smell a dragon turtle nearby. | 1 gp | 9 lb | [[5.

| 15 | Dragon Turtle Plastron (3 large pouches of shards) | The plastron of the dragon turtle is the cartilage-like substance that protects the underbelly of the dragon turtle. Not nearly as tough as the shell of the dragon turtle, it nonetheless has its uses. When ground up, mixed with herbs, and set into a jelly, it creates a life-saving (if unpalatable) medicine. | 400 gp | 20 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dragon Turtle Jelly.md\|Dragon Turtle Jelly]] |
| 20 | Steam Ventral | **.** A basket sized organ located alongside the lungs. When the dragon turtle inhales water, some is stored inside this organ, where it reacts with enzymes that rapidly accelerate heating. While it appears nominally that this organ is meant to provide the dragon turtle with warmth during its deep sea dives, it doubles as a defense mechanism, allowing the dragon turtle to spit jets of scalding steam from its mouth. When harvested, it maintains this property, but lacks both the muscular support for long ranges and the ability to refill on enzymes, giving it a short shelf life.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, a creature may squeeze the steam ventral to release a 30-foot cone of scalding steam. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 15d6\|avg\|noform` (`15d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage. This ability can only be used within 48 hours of the dragon turtle's death. Once used, the steam ventral is emptied out and rendered useless. | 3,000 gp | 30 lb | â€” |
| 25 | Dragon Turtle Shell Shard | Almost thicker than the scales of an ancient dragon, the shell of a dragon turtle is able to deflect almost anything the sea can throw at it. Although it can be difficult to find one that is suitable, a shard of a dragon turtle's shell can make for one of the finest shields known outside of legends. | 6,000 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
