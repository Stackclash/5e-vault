| 15 | Fetid Miasma (vial) | If a dretch is useful for one thing it is to make a literal big stink. When masses of these demons gather, the resulting effluent can be more dangerous than even a rampaging balor.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. | 8 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
