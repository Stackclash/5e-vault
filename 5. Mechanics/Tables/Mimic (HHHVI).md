| 5 | Mimic Glue (vial) | When a mimic is on the hunt, it produces an extremely powerful adhesive that can hold down even the strongest of adventurers. This adhesive remains usable after the mimic's death so long as it is kept in an airtight environment, and is a common industrial material. **Requires [[5.

| 15 | Mimic Gel (3 vials) | The ooze that secretes from an injured mimic carries many unique properties and is the main contributor to the mimic's extraordinary ability to change its appearance. Alchemists have long since discovered how to mix this substance with other ingredients to create a magical oil that can change the appearance of small items. | 4 gp | 3 lb | Mimic Oil |
