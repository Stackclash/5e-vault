# Orc Hand of Yurtrus
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 37* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Orc Blood (3 vials) | The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatibility with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs.<br /><br />**Use.** When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. | 1 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Yurtrus-touched Heart | A heart touched by the orc god Yurtrus is horribly diseased and ridden with pustules. It is extremely unpalatable to consume, but to be honest, so should all other orc hearts.<br /><br />**Use.** You may spend your action to eat this heart. If you do so, for the next hour, any spell you cast does not require a verbal component. This benefit cannot be taken by any character with elvish ancestry. | 5 gp | 2 lb | — |
