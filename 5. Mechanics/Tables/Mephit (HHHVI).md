| 5 | Mote of Dual Nature | When a mephit dies, it explodes into a cloud of its base material. If quickly harvested and kept, samples of these base materials can be preserved and used in alchemical mixtures. It is not uncommon for an alchemist's assistant to spend their day summoning and harvesting mephits just to restock their master's supplies. **Requires [[5.
