## Good Ideals

| Good Ideals |
|-------------|
| Life. Harvested meat will feed the hungry, harvested furs will warm the cold. Through death, comes life. (Good) |
| Healing. There is no need for the common people to suffer from illness so long as nature provides cures and I am there to find them. (Good) |
^good-ideals

## Evil Ideals

| Evil Ideals |
|-------------|
| Wrath. Plants are actually some of the deadliest organisms in the world, their only issue is that they can't move. That's where I come in. (Evil) |
| Dominance. Nothing shows off your strength like having your own Owlbear-head trophy. (Evil) |
^evil-ideals

## Lawful Ideals

| Lawful Ideals |
|---------------|
| Sustainability. Plant life must be controlled and maintained by sentient creatures so that their uses may continue to serve us. (Lawful) |
| Honor. I refuse to use something harvested from a creature that I did not kill with my own hands. (Lawful) |
^lawful-ideals

## Chaotic Ideals

| Chaotic Ideals |
|----------------|
| Conservation. I have joined the war on nature, on the side of nature. Anyone that would try to harm the plants must go through me first. (Chaotic) |
| Opportunity. If something is already dead, what's the point of letting its corpse go to waste? (Chaotic) |
^chaotic-ideals

## Neutral Ideals

| Neutral Ideals |
|----------------|
| Necessity. Creatures kill and harvest other creatures to survive. You may not like it, but it's just the way things are. (Neutral) |
| Discovery. I am travelling the world to document and research the plants I find, and hopefully discover a new one myself. (Neutral) |
^neutral-ideals

## Universal Ideals (Any)

| Universal Ideals (Any) |
|------------------------|
| Money. People always want hides, pelts, and skins; I may as well be the one to profit off it. (Any) |
| Naturalism. I believe that there is nothing that the gifts of nature cannot solve, and that civilisation only tends to get in its way. (Any) |
