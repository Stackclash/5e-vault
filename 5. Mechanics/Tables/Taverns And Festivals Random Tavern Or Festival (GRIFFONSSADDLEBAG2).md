| dice: d12 | Tavern | Festival |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Lost Souls** is an eerily quiet establishment, known mostly for its odd sounds and whispers, floating cups, and silent but oft-moving doors. | **First Moon Festival** is the celebration of the first moon of the new year and is a symbol of new beginnings. Special lanterns and candles are lit as an offering for good luck for the year. |
| 2 | **The Unlucky Hare** prides itself on having the softest and finest pelts, hides, and furs to provide luxurious comfort and warmth for its patrons. | **Blue Moon Festival** is a high-class gathering of rare and bizarre items, as well as exclusive merchants who will only sell to those willing to pay their sometimes exorbitant entrance fees. |
| 3 | **Otyugh's Bane** is an immaculately kept business that employs many workers to keep things spick and span. Waste and refuse are magically removed as well. | **Lunar Eclipse Festival** is a day dedicated to warding against the encroaching shadow of an eclipse. Bonfires and fireworks are lit throughout the duration of the eclipse. |
| 4 | **The Left-Handed Knight** is known for the pieces of armor that cover the dings and dents in its walls, as the visitors often get out of hand. | **The Gluttonous Gourd Gathering** is a wandering caravan whose wagons are painted in deep oranges and greens. Whenever they set up near a settlement, they share their gardening secrets and homebrewed pumpkin ale over several nights. |
| 5 | **The Golden Lion** is a warm, multi-leveled tavern that has many large rooms for the adventuring parties that pass through the area. | **Singer's Strings** sets up shop along the outside of towns and cities, inviting the trade of story and songs. Contests of songs and performances are often rewarded with fine instruments and books of ballads. |
| 6 | **The Tone-Deaf Siren** is renowned for its wide variety of well-respected entertainers. At night, the hall is filled with music and dancing until the sun comes up. | **Feasts of the Fallen Stars** is a winter festival where visitors gather to eat a hearty supper under the light of annual shooting stars. The next day, the festival-goers search for the fallen meteors to collect for their rare materials. |
| 7 | **The Crossroads** seems to be the place for lost wanderers in the city, with its dark furniture only matching the shady deals made under its tables. | **Green Palm Week** is a week-long festival in which people work together in preparation for the growing season, cultivating fields and community gardens. At the end of the week, special events that reward the people for their work are held. |
| 8 | **The Leaping Chain** is carefully tucked along the side of a mountain, giving all who stay there a grand view of the land below. | **The Clarity** is a celebration marking the anniversary of when an ancient curse and its madness were lifted from the land.  |
| 9 | **The Chromatic Scowl** proudly displays a large set of dragon fangs behind the bar, assembled from various sizes and colors of evil dragons. | **The Cavalcade** is a spectacular celebration in which people split into two groups and reenact a magical war by launching harmless, yet brilliant, fireworks at one another. |
| 10 | **The Howling Hall** is a wide lodge that often houses a dozen wolves at any point, with the pack trading their protection for the hall's housing. | **Hero's March** is a memorial celebration of legendary adventurers and their many heroic deeds. Locals dress up in elaborate costumes depicting their favorite heroes: typically ones who either originated from the area or performed a great service to them. |
| 11 | **The Tipsy Wyvern** is a tavern most known for its upside-down layout and eclectic decorations. | **The Tumbler's Traveling Troupe** is a motley collection of clowns and jesters that roll through towns bringing merriment and festivity. |
| 12 | **The Prophet's Garden** has walls covered in vines and flowers, with small patches of grass tucked into the corners, and a small pond filled with gem-like fish. | **Skye Carnival** began after a friendly cloud giant shared insight into flight, freedom, and the winds. During the event, colorful balloons and kites fill the sky. |
