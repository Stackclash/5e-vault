| 10 | Psionic Overflow | The star spawn are notorious for the way in which they interfere with minds of creatures native to the Material Plane. While research on them is sparse at best, it is widely believed that this phenomenon is due to the discordant resonance that their own minds constantly emit that is at odds with our own. Who knows? Perhaps on their own worlds, the star spawn are harmless and peaceful, only becoming violent and cruel when they interact with creatures like us that are incompatible with their own structure of reality. Further study is definitely needed on this topic, thus fueling demand for samples of the star spawn's inherent psychic energy. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper Hhhvi.md\|spirit paper]].** | 2 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Star Spawn Mangler Arm (×4) | The star spawn mangler is a horrid creature that lurks on the edges of both sight and mind. Difficult to fathom properly even in visible light, they are very capable of using their gangly arms to fulfill their namesake. The claws they wield are sharp and many; as such they make wonderful harvesting sources for weaponry. | 25 gp | 15 lb | +1 Melee Piercing or Slashing Weapon |
