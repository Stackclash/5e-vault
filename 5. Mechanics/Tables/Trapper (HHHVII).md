| 20 | Trapper Hide | The hide of a trapper is known far and wide for its camouflage capabilities. Before it can be tanned, it must also be boiled in a weak solution of lime for a lengthy period of time in order to remove the trapper's remaining digestive acids. The effort is worth it however, as the end result is a fine material to craft a cloak coveted by thieves, spies, and assassins everywhere. | 90 gp | 16 lb | [[5.
