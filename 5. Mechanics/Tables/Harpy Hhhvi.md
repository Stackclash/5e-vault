| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Harpy Feather (small pouch) | Harpy feathers are notably large but of a fine quality, reflective of the harpies beautiful but dangerous nature. Too large for fletching, they nonetheless make excellent quills. | 4 sp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 15 | Harpy Vocal Cords | If harpies are known for one thing, it is their singing. Their vocal cords are able to produce a wide variety of sounds, and some daring bards have taken to using them as strings for their instruments. Bards with instruments of the harpies are said to play music that can entrance entire rooms of listeners. | 2 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harpy Harp Hhhvi.md\|Harpy Harp]] |
| 20 | Harpy Egg | On a rare occasion, you may slay a harpy that was in the middle of ovulation. Whether the egg is fertilised is irrelevant, as it is the eggshell that holds the true value. When this pink-speckled shell is powdered, it makes a dye with potent magical abilities. | 8 gp | 3 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harpy Ink Hhhvi.md\|Harpy Ink]] |
