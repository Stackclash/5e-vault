| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Pteranodon Wing (×2) | The wing of the pteranodon resembles an organic canvas stretched over skeletal bone. The canvas itself is quite useful for the creation of small sails and similar equipment, and merchants will pay a decent amount for an intact sample. | 6 sp | 17 lb | — |
| 15 | Pteranodon Beak | The pteranodon's beak in many ways resembles a lance formed of keratin. Evidently, many primitive cultures agree, and seeing a tribe armed with pteranodon lances is not uncommon. | 1 gp | 7 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance.md\|Lance]] |
