| 10 | Treachery Skull (×3) | A skull lord is formed when three treacherous individuals fail a dark master who punishes them with eternal bondage to one another. The level of hate and betrayal necessary to warrant such a cruel punishment is reserved only for the most wicked of creatures, and such acts of evil have a tendency to leave magical traces in the bodies of those creatures themselves. As such, the skulls of a skull lord carry strong traces of dark magic, something you can tell even by just looking at their permanently smirking faces.<br /><br />**Use.** So long as you carry this skull on your person, you have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]) checks and any attempt to magically compel you to tell the truth or to discern your true intentions automatically fails. | 205 gp | 7 lb | — |
| 15 | Trident Spine | While at a cursory glance, the skull lord may seem like an ordinary human skeleton with two extra skulls jammed on, there are actually many more subtle differences than that. One is the so-called "trident spine", a twisted, branching version of the human spine that resembles the weapon that bears its name. | 1,285 gp | 30 lb | [[5.

| 20 | Fused Soul | The creation of a soul ^[[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: skull] lord is an irreversible process; once three wretched individuals have been bound together by whatever dark force sought to punish them, they are joined for all eternity. Even their souls become merged into a chaotic swirl of conflict and hate that would seem impossible were it not for the sheer spite that all three use to maintain the cohesion of their spirit. In magical terms, the fused soul of a skull lord is extremely valuable for use as a crafting material as it displays properties that cannot be found anywhere else in the multiverse. **Requires [spirit paper]].** | 2,880 gp | 1 lb | [[5.
