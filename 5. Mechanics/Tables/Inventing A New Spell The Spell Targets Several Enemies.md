# Inventing a New Spell; The Spell Targets Several Enemies
*Source: Strongholds and Followers* 

**The Spell Targets Several Enemies**

`dice: [[Inventing A New Spell The Spell Targets Several Enemies.md#^the-spell-targets-several-enemies]]`

| dice: d8 | Spell Effect |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Overwhelming:** Affected targets are knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]]. |
| 2 | **Thunderous:** Affected targets are pushed 10 feet back. |
| 3 | **Defiling:**  Roll 1d6. All affected targets take that much damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the total damage done to the targets. |
| 4 | **Immobilizing:** Roots the targets to their current spots until the start of their next turn. They are grappled. |
| 5 | **Blinding:** Flesh grows over the targets' eyeballs. They are blind for one round per tower level. |
| 6 | **Hideous:** Until the start of their next turn, affected targets' arms mutate into tentacles. They drop their weapons. If they don't have arms, they grow them, flailing ineffectually, missing attacks and failing to cast spells. |
| 7 | **Enfeebling:** Targets gain vulnerability to fire, ice, electricity, or acid—chosen each time the spell is cast—for one round per tower level. |
| 8 | **Telekinetic:** Move all affected targets 10 feet in any one direction. If moved 10 feet up, each target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage when they fall back down and must make a DC 10 Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check or fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]] |
