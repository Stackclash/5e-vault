# Grymclover Forests; Corrupted Creatures
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 278* 

Beasts, monstrosities, and even plants that venture into a grymclover forest will sometimes become suffused by the area's corrupting magic, twisting them with mystifying effects. At your discretion, you can use the following table to determine how a creature may have been warped by the corruption.

`dice: [[Grymclover Forests Corrupted Creatures (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md#^creature-changes]]`

| dice: d6 | Creature Changes |
|----------|------------------|
| 1 | The creature can use a bonus action to turn [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md\|invisibility]] spell. |
| 2 | The creature can use an action to cast a 1st-level spell at will, such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bane.md\|bane]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Entangle.md\|entangle]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|inflict wounds]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]]. |
| 3 | The creature regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the creature takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. |
| 4 | The creature is covered in dense brambles, which grant it a +2 bonus to AC and deals `dice:1d6\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`d6`) piercing damage to any creature that [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapples]] it or is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by it at the start of each of its turns. |
| 5 | The creature has telepathy out to 120 feet and is aware of the presence of creatures within that range that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature. |
| 6 | The creature has increased pain tolerance, gaining 30 temporary hit points whenever it finishes a short or long rest. If another creature hits it with a melee attack while it has these hit points, the attacker takes 5 necrotic damage. |
