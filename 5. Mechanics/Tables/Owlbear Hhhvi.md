| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Owlbear Feathers (large bag) | The feathers of an owlbear are noticeably soft and downy, in contrast to their more ferocious appearance. While these feathers make for poor fletching, they actually do make fantastic bedding material, and owlbear feather stuffed pillows are the hallmark of any well equipped bedroom. | 2 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Owlbear Liver | The liver of an owlbear is a potent medicinal ingredient, used to treat everything from indigestion, to kidney stones, to mudgut. Unfortunately, this very property has led to owlbears facing overhunting in some regions. | 10 gp | 6 lb | — |
| 20 | Owlbear Neck | Ask anybody who has once tried to hide from an owlbear, and they will tell you of how futile that effort is. Their keen eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell, combined with their eerie owl-like tendency to twist their heads behind them while tracking, make them a terrifying predator to elude. A scarf made from a part of their carcass also grants some level of these senses, giving its owner some level of heightened awareness. | 50 gp | 10 lb | [[5.
