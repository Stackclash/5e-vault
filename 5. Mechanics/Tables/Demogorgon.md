| — | Demogorgon's Spine | The mysterious Y-shaped symbol of Demogorgon that drives all who gaze upon it mad is said to be representative of their spine that branches into two in order to support their dual heads. It is at this nexus that the madness and paranoia of both heads collide, creating a potent magical source capable of breaking the minds of lesser creatures it is used upon. | — | 50 lb | [[5.
