`dice: [[Wandering The Mists (VRGR).md#^wandering-the-mists]]`

**Wandering the Mists**

| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 01–20 | Characters emerge in a domain of your choosing. |
| 21–40 | Characters wander the Mists for another `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) hours, then roll on this table again. |
| 41–65 | Characters emerge from the Mists on stable ground `dice: 1d100\|avg` (`1d100`) feet away from where they entered. |
| 66–75 | Characters emerge on stable ground a mile from where they entered the Mists at midnight of the night after they entered the Mists. |
| 76–85 | Characters emerge from the Mists inside a structure somewhere within the domain they tried to leave, perhaps a cave, crypt, shed, or closet. |
| 86–95 | Other creatures appear within the Mists. Roll any die. If you roll an even number, a lost and terrified [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Commoner.md\|commoner]] appears. If you roll an odd number, `dice: 2d6\|avg` (`2d6`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Skeleton.md\|skeletons]] or 1 [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Unspeakable Horror (VRGR).md\|unspeakable horror]] (see "chapter 5") appears. After the encounter, another `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) hours pass, then roll on this table again. |
| 96–99 | Characters emerge from the Mists where they entered to find the domain changed. Perhaps someone the characters knew is gone, and no one has any knowledge of them ever existing. |
| 100 | Characters emerge from the Mists on a world on the Material Plane. After `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) hours, the Mists rise around them once more. Roll again on this table. |
