# Bronze Scout

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Gnome-made Servo | The internal mechanisms of the clockwork constructs can seem almost like magic for anyone not trained in the tinkering and gnomish sciences. While they may vary from model to model (and indeed, even among the same type of clockwork), they all share the same design for the core set of gears that power its lifelike movements. Tinkers of all breeds value these mastercrafted servos to use in their own creations, and will pay a decent price to avoid having to make them on their own. | 1 gp | 5 lb | — |
| 15 | Quartz Plating | The plating of the bronze scout is forged from a unique method that incorporates quartz and minerals into the smelting process. The result is an alloy that not only resonates with the earth, but also has a distinctive amber tone. Unfortunately, the former trait quickly dissipates once disconnected from the construct, but it still retains the attractive coloring and can be recrafted into a rather fetching suit of armor. | 2 gp | 30 lb | Splint Armor or Plate Armor |
| 20 | Volt Core | **.** The bronze scout is not built for combat, but it does possess a few tricks up its sleeves (despite its lack of arms). The most notable is a literally shocking ability to release a wave of lightning along the ground to distract its foes while it burrows to safety. The core responsible for this is fragile however, and only recharges when still attached to a functioning scout. As such, although it is useful in a pinch, it is a strictly one-time use item only.<br /><br />**Note.** This item can only be harvested if the bronze scout had its *lightning flare* ability available at the time of its death.<br /><br />**Use.** As an action, you may throw this item at the ground up to 15 feet away from you, causing it to explode on impact. All creatures touching the ground within 15 feet of the explosion must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 2d6\|avg` (`2d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. | 8 gp | 4 lb | — |
