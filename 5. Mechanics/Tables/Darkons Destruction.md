| dice: d4 | Destruction |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | With Azalin gone, Darkon has no purpose. The Shadowfell is reabsorbing the demiplane. |
| 2 | Darkon is being consumed to fuel magic funneling power from Castle Avernus into the King's Tear. |
| 3 | The Hour of Ascension was an attack. Invaders are using the Shroud to disguise their assault. |
| 4 | The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Priest Of Osybus.md\|priests of Osybus]] (see "chapter 5") are draining life from Darkon to empower the imprisoned vestige of a wicked deity. |
