# Chitine
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 12* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 10 | Chitine Blood (vial) | Chitine blood actually has much in common with their drow progenitors, and as such is just as capable of creating the infamous [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drow Poison.md\|drow poison]]. While most chitine do not have the facilities to transmute their blood into this poison, they become capable of producing it naturally when they are in their choldrith forms. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drow Poison.md\|Drow Poison]] |
| 15 | Chitine Fur (small pouch) | Chitine fur is surprisingly light and fluffy, and if one closes their eyes while touching it, they would not be at fault for thinking they were touching a duckling's down. This density is what allows a chitine to sense tiny vibrations in their webs, and good samples of this fur can help an enterprising adventurer identify these hazards and avoid them.<br /><br />**Use.** You may sprinkle this pouch of fur as an action on any web within 5 feet of you. This fur will vibrate strongly if a creature comes in contact with the web it is sprinkled on. Once this fur has been sprinkled on a web, it cannot be removed. | 2 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
