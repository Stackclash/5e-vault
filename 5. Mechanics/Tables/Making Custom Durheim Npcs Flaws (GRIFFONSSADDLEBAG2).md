| dice: d6 | Flaw |
|----------|------|
| 1 | Growing up in the monastery, I've been sheltered from the outside world, so I'm a bit clueless about most social interactions. |
| 2 | I focus so much on the Ethereal Plane, I often lose track of or downright ignore events on the Material Plane. |
| 3 | My forays into deep meditation have left me feeling detached from my physical body, it sometimes feels like a burden. |
| 4 | I don't sleep often or well, due to nightmares about some of my more horrifying ghost hunts. |
| 5 | I've grown so accustomed to following my superiors' requests, that I sometimes struggle to think or act for myself. |
| 6 | I secretly long for the day I die, so that I can experience what it's like firsthand. |
