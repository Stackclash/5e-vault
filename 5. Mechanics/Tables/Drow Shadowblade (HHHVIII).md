| 10 | Drow Blood (3 vials) | Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Drow Lolth (MTF).md\|Lolth]], drow blood possesses some unique property that when rebrewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers. | 1 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Drow Poison.md\|Drow Poison]] |
| 15 | Drow Heart | Obviously, every drow has a heart (despite any evidence to the contrary), yet only the powerful in their society are blessed enough by [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Drow Lolth (MTF).md\|Lolth]] for their hearts to be worth anything. As a drow climbs in their society, [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Drow Lolth (MTF).md\|Lolth's]] rewards to them begin to compound, causing them to become slightly more magical. Upon their death, their hearts may be removed and this magic released to simulate the gifts that [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Drow Lolth (MTF).md\|Lolth]] once offered them in life.<br /><br />**Use.** By using an action to stab the heart with a knife, the user may use the *summon demon* ability listed in the drow priestess' statblock. After this, the heart is rendered useless. In order to use this ability, the user must be able to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Summon Lesser Demons (XGE).md\|summon lesser demons]] spell. | 30 gp | 1 lb | â€” |
| 20 | Shadowed Soul | A drow shadowblade is more than a simple spy or slinker. These masterful assassins are magically imbued by a demonic ritual that both taints their soul permanently and grants them extraordinary powers. It is in fact their soul that grants them their infamous shadow sword ability; a power that can be replicated by a harvester capable of extracting the shadow essence of the drow's soul before it departs for the Abyss. **Requires [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spirit Paper (HHHVI).md\|spirit paper]].** | 1,625 gp | 1 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shadow Sword (HHHVIII).md\|Shadow Sword]] |
