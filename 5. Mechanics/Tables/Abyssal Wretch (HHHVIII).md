| 10 | Wretch Pustules | Much like their rutterkin progenitors, an abyssal wretch is constantly covered in open sores, wounds, and pustules. However, unlike the rutterkin, these pustules do not emit a completely horrid stench when popped; they merely emit a somewhat horrid stench at all times. As such, some demonic cults have taken to using them as a twisted incense when performing their rituals. That said, this practice has largely fallen out of favor, since the lingering stench makes the cults extremely easy to find and identify. | 5 sp | 6 lb | â€” |
