*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 85* 

| DC | Item | Description | Value | Weight | Crafting |
|----|------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Otyugh Bile (vial) | As disgusting as the idea may sound, otyugh bile, capable of digesting just about anything, actually makes for a very good medicine for indigestion. A common remedy prescibred by a village's medicine woman is a dose of diluted otyugh bile mixed with a spoonful of honey (mostly to mask the taste). | 5 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 10 | Otyugh Saliva (vial) | An otyugh's saliva is not actually poisonous, but it is loaded with so much bacteria and disease that it may as well be.<br /><br />**Use.** This saliva can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the disease is cured. For every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by `dice:1d10\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`d10`) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured. | 40 gp | 1 lb | — |
| 15 | Otyugh Tentacle | The tentacles of an otyugh are tipped with incredibly sharp needles that both pierce its foes and allow it to drag them around. Underdark slavers are often found with whips made from these tentacles, designed to capture their prey alive. | 25 gp | 15 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Otyugh Whip (HHHVI).md\|Otyugh Whip]] |
| 20 | Otyugh Telepathy Ganglia | An odd cluster of nerves at the section in which the otyugh's tentacles meet its back. The composition is incompatible with the more complicated brain structure of a humanoid, but it actually does work on simpler life forms like beasts. | 100 gp | 2 lb | [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sensory Collar (HHHVI).md\|Sensory Collar]] |
