## Hull

- **Armor Class** 25
- **Hit Points** 500 (damage threshold 20)

## Traits

**Crafting** Tarrasque Shell Ã—1 ([[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Artificer (HHHVI).md\|Artificer]])

**Reflective Carapace** If the titan ship is targeted by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]] spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the ship is unaffected. On a 6, the ship is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the ship, turning the caster into the target.

**Tarrasque Shell** This ship's hull is formed from the shell of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Tarrasque.md\|tarrasque]] and shares much of its properties. It possesses 3 sails and can travel at 2 1/2 mph in a good wind.
