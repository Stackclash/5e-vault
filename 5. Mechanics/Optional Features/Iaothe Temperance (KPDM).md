# Iaothe (Temperance)
*Source: Deep Magic p. 179*  

When it makes a Wisdom saving throw, the user can use its reaction to add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to the roll. The bonus is added after the die is rolled but before the GM reveals whether the saving throw succeeds or fails. *Greater:* The user can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]].

Once it is used, this seal doesn't function again until the user finishes a short or long rest.
