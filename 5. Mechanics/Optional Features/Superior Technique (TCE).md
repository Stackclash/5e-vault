# Superior Technique
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 41*  

You learn one [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Optfeaturetype Mv B.md\|maneuver]] of your choice from among those available to the [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Fighter Battle Master.md\|Battle Master]] archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

You gain one superiority die, which is a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
