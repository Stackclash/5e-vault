# Ingwaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 240*  

*Ancestors, major deities*

- **Benefit.** You have proficiency on Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#History\|History]]) checks.  
- **Power (4th level).** When you use an action to trace ingwaz on a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spear]], the first character who uses the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spear]] against an enemy adds `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) radiant damage to attacks made with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spear]]. The first attack must be made within 8 hours after the rune is traced, and the benefit lasts for 1 minute after it is triggered.  
- **Power (5th level).** When you trace ingwaz on the face of a willing creature, the creature gains the benefit of the [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Barbarian.md\|barbarian's]] [Rage](compendium/classes/barbarian.md#Rage%20(Level%201)) class feature, as though it were a [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Barbarian.md\|barbarian]] of your character level. Tracing the rune takes two actions, and the effect lasts for 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When ingwaz is traced on the flesh of a corpse, the rune creates the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Dead.md\|speak with dead]] spell on that corpse. Tracing the rune takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.
