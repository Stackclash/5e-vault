This symbol represents knowledge gained over an extended time through dedication and effort.

**Benefit:** You gain the ability to speak and read one additional language of your choice.

**Power:** After meditating on this hieroglyph for 10 minutes, you can cast comprehend Languages.

**Power (2nd level)** If you take an action to trace this symbol on your forehead or that of another creature, the recipient gains advantage on Intelligence checks for 1 minute.

**Mastery Power:** By inhaling incense and powders over the course of an hour, you call upon your ancestors to reveal a bit of knowledge from the past. This knowledge enables you to gain your ancestors' assistance with a problem immediately before you. The implementation of this benefit is up to the GM; you might receive a specific clue that helps you to solve the problem, or you might gain proficiency for 1 hour with a skill or a set of tools, or advantage on a single type of skill check for the same length of time.
