# Open the Hidden Springs and Unbolt the Shrine
*Source: Deep Magic p. 219*  

This symbol represents casting off chains, putting down oppression, and opening pathways.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand\|Sleight of Hand]]) checks.

**Power:** If you use an action to trace this hieroglyph on a rope, chain, or other implement that's holding you in place, you gain advantage on Dexterity checks made to free yourself. This benefit doesn't apply to checks made to Escape a grapple, unless you're being Grappled by an inanimate object.

**Mastery Power:** When you take an action to trace this hieroglyph on the body of a willing creature, you can impart to that creature the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blink.md\|blink]] spell.
