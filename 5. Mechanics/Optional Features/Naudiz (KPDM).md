# Naudiz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 241*  

*Necessity and filling needs*

- **Benefit.** Once per day, you can cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spare The Dying.md\|spare the dying]].  
- **Power (4th level).** By spending an action to trace naudiz on an item, you grant a creature that touches the item the benefit of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Guidance.md\|guidance]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Resistance.md\|resistance]] spell (creature's choice). A number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus can benefit from this effect. Both the rune and the effect last while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.  
- **Power (5th level).** You can trace naudiz in the air in such a way that five creatures within 10 feet of you have their hit point maximums increased by 5, and each gains 5 hit points. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts for 8 hours.  
- **Mastery Power (15th level).** When you use an action to trace naudiz on an object weighing no more than 20 pounds, you can call that item to you once during the next 24 hours if it is anywhere within 400 feet. The item teleports into your hand instantly when you use an action to call it. If another creature is holding the object, that creature prevents it from teleporting with a successful Charisma saving throw (using your Wisdom modifier to set the DC).
