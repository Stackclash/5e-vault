# Pact of the Chain (The Frozen One)
*Source: Deep Magic p. 278*  

***Prerequisites*** "The Frozen One" Patron

You learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Imp.md\|imp]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Pseudodragon.md\|pseudodragon]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Quasit.md\|quasit]], or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fey/Sprite.md\|sprite]].

Additionally, when you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own.

## The Frozen One's Pact Boons

When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you can choose the form of an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Ice Mephit.md\|ice mephit]] in addition to the usual options granted by the pact boon. When you use your action to command your mephit familiar to attack, it can use its breath or cast an innate spell instead.
