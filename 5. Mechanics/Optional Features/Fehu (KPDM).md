# Fehu
*Source: Deep Magic p. 239*  

*Cattle, livestock, and wealth*

- **Benefit.** You have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Animal%20Handling\|Animal Handling]]) checks concerning domesticated animals that aren't used as riding mounts.  
- **Power.** Sketching fehu on an object makes that item easier to lift or drag, as if it were only half its actual weight. Sketching the rune takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour. This power works equally well on a single object, such as a block of stone, or on a collection of objects that are bundled together, such as a large chest stuffed with coins.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** By spending 1 minute tracing fehu on your skin, you can cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Beast.md\|dominate beast]] as though from a 6th-level spell slot. The effect must be used within 10 minutes of completing the tracing, or the rune's power dissipates.
