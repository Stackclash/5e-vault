# Ophanim (Humility)
*Source: Deep Magic p. 179*  

The user adds half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to its Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks. It keeps this benefit until the start of its next turn when it takes a hostile action (any action that could inflict intentional damage on a creature). *Greater:* If it hasn't taken a hostile action this turn, the user can use its action to present an aura of humility. A creature that wants to attack the user must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or choose another target. If there are no other targets it can attack, the creature spends its action doing nothing.
