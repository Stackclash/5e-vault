# Stony Refuge
*Source: Deep Magic p. 153*  

***Prerequisites*** Elemental focus (earth)

When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to create a slab of stone that interposes itself between you and one creature of your choice. Until the end of your next turn, the slab provides half cover against the chosen creature.
