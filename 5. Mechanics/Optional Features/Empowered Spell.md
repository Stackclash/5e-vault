# Empowered Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 102. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
