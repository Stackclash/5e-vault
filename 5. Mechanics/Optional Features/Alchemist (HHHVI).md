***Prerequisites*** Proficiency with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Supplies.md\|Alchemist's Supplies]]

Alchemy is a profession that deals with the brewing and mixing of potions, concoctions, and tinctures. In general, if an organic material needs to be crushed, powdered, dried, boiled, melted, burned, mixed, etc., it's a job for an alchemist.

As part of their job, alchemists must also be experienced herbalists and have some knowledge of creature parts, but this level of knowledge may vary wildly from alchemist to alchemist. For example, village alchemists may know how to mix up local herbs with dried animal parts to cure a cold, while an elvish grandmaster may have learned the 12 secret uses of dragon blood.

Any character that has proficiency with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Supplies.md\|alchemy tools]] may be considered an alchemist for crafting purposes.
