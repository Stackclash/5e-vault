# Protection
*Source: Player's Handbook. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
