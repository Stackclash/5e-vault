# Algiz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 237*  

*Elk and reindeer, evading danger; the god Heimdall*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus on initiative rolls.  
- **Power (5th level).** Living creatures that are within 10 feet of an algiz rune when you draw it on the ground or on a wall gain a +2 bonus on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks and have advantage on saving throws against sleep spells and other magical effects that cause [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconsciousness]]. Both effects last for 8 hours. Scribing the rune takes 15 minutes.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** Marking a willing creature with the algiz rune transforms the creature into an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/E(LK).md\|elk]], as if by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Polymorph.md\|polymorph]] spell. Drawing the rune on the creature takes an action, and the change lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
