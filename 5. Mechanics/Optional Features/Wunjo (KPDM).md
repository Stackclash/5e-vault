*Happiness and joy*

- **Benefit.** After using inspiration or gifting it to another player, you have a 20 percent chance to retain it. If you use inspiration that was retained in this way, it can't be retained again.  
- **Power (4th level).** Tracing the wunjo rune on the ground or on a boulder creates the effect of an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animal Friendship.md\|animal friendship]] spell on one beast within 30 feet. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts for 24 hours.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** If you use an action to sketch wunjo on an object that you then hold aloft, your allies that can see you have advantage on saving throws against [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|fear]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charm]], and domination effects. The effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.
