# Berkanan
*Source: Deep Magic p. 238*  

*Birch tree, love, new beginnings; the Bear Maiden*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) checks.  
- **Power.** When you trace berkanan on a living creature, the rune grants the creature advantage on a single Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) check of its choosing. Tracing the rune takes 10 minutes, and it remains effective for up to 1 hour.  

    When you trace this rune on a living plant, an effect identical to a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spike Growth.md\|spike growth]] spell erupts in a 20-foot radius around the rune. Tracing the rune on a plant takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** You can create a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Philter Of Love.md\|philter of love]] once a week.
