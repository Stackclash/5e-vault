# Chamule (Judgment)
*Source: Deep Magic p. 179*  

When the user hits a creature with an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attack]], the user can move up to half its speed, provided it ends the move no farther away from the creature it hit. *Greater:* As a reaction when it is hit with an attack once during the next minute, the user can cause the attacker to take radiant damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) if the attacker is within 60 feet of the user.
