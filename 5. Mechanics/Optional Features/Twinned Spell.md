# Twinned Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 102. Available in the SRD.* 

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scorching Ray.md\|scorching ray]] aren't eligible, but [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Frost.md\|ray of frost]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chromatic Orb.md\|chromatic orb]] are.
