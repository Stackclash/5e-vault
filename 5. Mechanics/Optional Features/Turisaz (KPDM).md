# Turisaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 243*  

*Giants, thunder and lightning*

- **Benefit.** You gain Giant as a bonus language. If you already know this language, you gain advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) checks involving giants.  
- **Power (4th level).** A weapon marked with turisaz deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) lightning damage on each of the next five times it hits its target within the next hour. Marking the weapon takes an action.  
- **Power (5th level).** Armor marked with turisaz has resistance to lightning damage and grants a +2 bonus to the wearer's Strength score. Marking the armor takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When inscribed on a surface, the turisaz rune acts as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Glyph Of Warding.md\|glyph of warding]] that deals `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) lightning damage if triggered. Sketching the rune takes 1 hour, and the effect lasts for up to 24 hours, or until the glyph is triggered or dispelled.
