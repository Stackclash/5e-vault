# Grasping Arms of Balance
*Source: Deep Magic p. 218*  

This symbol represents the judgment of the dead, ever watchful and weighing the actions of the living in expectation of the moment when they eventually pass on from the world.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) checks.

**Power:** You trace this hieroglyph in ash on the body of a willing creature, which requires an action. For the next hour, the creature has advantage on Wisdom ability checks.

**Power (3rd level)** If you use an action to trace this hieroglyph in the air with your fingers, you force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you can immediately give the creature one Command, either verbally or in writing, that can be completed in the next minute. The creature must try to obey the Command to the best of its ability, provided that doing so won't directly harm it. If the task isn't completed within 1 minute, the glyph's power wears off and the creature is freed from the Compulsion.

**Mastery Power (9th level):** You spend 10 minutes decorating a piece of paper with this hieroglyph. If you then take an action to burn the paper, you can cast a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Geas.md\|geas]] spell on one target. As with a normal casting of the spell, you and the target must have a language in Common for the effect to work.
