# Hagalaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 239*  

*Hail, winter weather*

- **Benefit.** You have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks to predict weather conditions for the next 24 hours in your vicinity.  
- **Power.** If you take an action to trace hagalaz on a willing creature, it receives the benefit of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Energy.md\|protection from energy]] (cold) spell while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (5th level).** When you sketch hagalaz on the ground under the open sky, you produce the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleet Storm.md\|sleet storm]] centered on a point you choose within 150 feet. Sketching the rune takes 4 rounds, and the storm lasts while you concentrate, for up to 2 minutes.  
- **Mastery Power (14th level).** When hagalaz is sketched on the ground inside the area of an effect caused by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleet Storm.md\|sleet storm]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ice Storm.md\|ice storm]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Control Weather.md\|control weather]] (hail or blizzard only), or a similar spell, the rune brings about a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] effect as if that spell had been cast with a 7th-level slot. If the effect being dispelled is from 8th- or 9th-level magic, you use Charisma for the ability check to determine the rune's effectiveness. Sketching the rune takes 2 rounds.  
- **Mastery Power (14th level).** When hagalaz is sketched on the ground inside the area of a natural (nonmagical) storm, the rune brings about the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Control Weather.md\|control weather]] spell. Sketching the rune takes 1 hour, and the control lasts while you concentrate, for up to 8 hours.
