# Quick Toss
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42*  

As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.
