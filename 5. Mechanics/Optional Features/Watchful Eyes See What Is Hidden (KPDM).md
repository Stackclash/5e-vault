# Watchful Eyes See What Is Hidden
*Source: Deep Magic p. 220*  

This symbol represents looking beneath the surface to see the world differently or to question the way things are done.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) checks.

**Power (3rd level)** By spending 5 minutes tracing the hieroglyph on a creature, you imbue that creature with the ability to cast Detect Evil and Good once in the next 24 hours. The hieroglyph can also be created on a small object instead of directly on a creature; in that case, Detect Evil and Good can be cast once by a creature holding the object.

**Power (6th level)** After spending 10 minutes inking this hieroglyph in the Middle of your forehead, you gain the benefits of casting Detect Thoughts for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute.

**Mastery Power:** By taking an action to draw this hieroglyph, you can cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Arcane Eye.md\|arcane eye]].
