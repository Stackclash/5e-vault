# With One Heart and Voice, The People Raise Cries of Joy
*Source: Deep Magic p. 220*  

This symbol represents unity, community, common purpose and goals, and protecting one another.

**Benefit:** You have advantage on any saving throw that is also being made by at least one of your allies.

**Power (3rd level)** By using an action to draw this hieroglyph on a rope that you use to bind your wrist to another creature, you can absorb the damage and other effects from the next attack that hits the other creature. The attack must hit the other creature, but it affects you instead; the other creature is unaffected. The rope can be no more than 30 feet long.

**Mastery Power:** By invoking this hieroglyph during a 10-minute ritual, you can grant telepathy to up to ten creatures that are within 60 feet of you. The telepathy lasts for 1 hour, and it works only among the affected creatures (including you); it can't be used to communicate with creatures outside the group.
