# Otalan
*Source: Deep Magic p. 242*  

*Property, inheritance, family*

- **Benefit.** You gain proficiency on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) checks.  
- **Power (7th level).** When this rune is traced on a reflective surface (for example, a mirror, a polished shield, or even still water), otalan lets you scry on an object that you have possessed for at least one week, or on any member of your immediate family within three generations of you, as if subjected to the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] spell. Tracing the rune takes 10 minutes, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 10 minutes.  
- **Mastery Power (13th level).** When otalan is invoked on an object, the rune's power lingers harmlessly in the item until the death of the item's owner. The moment that creature dies, the object teleports into the hands of another individual whose identity is specified when the rune is created. This person can be described by name, by title, or by relationship (for example, "the king of Noatun" or "my firstborn son"). This power functions over any range as long as the object and the individual are on the same plane. If another creature is holding the object when its owner dies, that creature can prevent the object from teleporting by making a successful Charisma saving throw (using your Wisdom modifier to set the DC). The rune remains effective until it is triggered or until you use this power to invoke the rune on a different object. Preparing the object takes 10 minutes.
