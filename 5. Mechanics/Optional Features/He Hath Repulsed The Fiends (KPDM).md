# He Hath Repulsed the Fiends
*Source: Deep Magic p. 218*  

**This Symbol** represents the prevention of harm, usually through the Protection of devoted soldiers or bodyguards.

**Benefit:** When you wear no armor, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Dexterity modifier.

**Power (3rd level)** If you take an action to trace this hieroglyph on a creature, you grant that creature resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) for 1 minute.

**Power (5th level)** By taking an action to burn a bit of incense, you can conjure a squad of soldiers. These soldiers can appear different to different creatures; some might see a squad of orcs, others a group of the king's guards. The soldiers appear standing inside a 10-foot-square space within 10 feet of you, and they can't leave that space. Within that space, they behave like a swarm; other creatures can enter the space and end their turn there. Whenever one of your enemies enters the soldiers' space or starts its turn in the space or within 5 feet of it, the soldiers attack that creature. Their attack bonus is equal to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier, and a successful attack deals `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) force damage. The soldiers remain for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on them. They are immune to all forms of damage and can't be dispelled except by breaking your concentration.

**Mastery Power (8th level):** If you take an action to trace this hieroglyph on the ground and then throw a handful of sand into the air, you can cast Banishment.
