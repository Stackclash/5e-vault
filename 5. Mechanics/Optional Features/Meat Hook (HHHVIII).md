# Meat Hook
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 112*  

***Prerequisites*** 3rd Fighter (Butcher)

If you dealt piercing damage, you may make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check against your target by lodging your weapon in your target's body as part of the same attack. While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] this way, you cannot make attacks with the weapon you used to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] them. Whenever a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] in this way attempts to escape the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] and fails, they automatically suffer `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) piercing damage as they clumsily attempt to remove the weapon piercing them.
