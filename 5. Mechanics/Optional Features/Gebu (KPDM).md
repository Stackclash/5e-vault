# Gebu
*Source: Deep Magic p. 239*  

*Generosity and hospitality, gifts*

- **Benefit.** You have advantage on Intelligence checks to estimate an item's value.  
- **Power.** When you spend 1 minute carefully examining an item while tracing gebu on it, you learn the item's name and magical properties, as if you had cast an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell. Alternatively, if you use an action to trace gebu on a willing creature, that creature gains the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sanctuary.md\|sanctuary]] spell. (You can't use this power on yourself.) The effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** To use this power, you take an action to scratch or sketch gebu on a wall, floor, or other surface of an enclosed space, in a place where it is clearly visible. For up to 1 minute thereafter, you can activate the rune with a command word, provided you are within 20 feet of it. When you do so, each creature within 20 feet of the rune and with a clear line of sight to it (regardless of whether the creature can actually see it) must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is affected as if by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] spell that lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
