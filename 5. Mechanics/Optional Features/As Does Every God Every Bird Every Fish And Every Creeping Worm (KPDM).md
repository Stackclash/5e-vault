# As Does Every God, Every Bird, Every Fish, and Every Creeping Worm
*Source: Deep Magic p. 215*  

This symbol represents the fertility and abundance of animal life and every being's place in the chain of life.

**Benefit(s):** You gain advantage on ability checks or skill checks to identify creatures.

**Power:** You can use an action to quickly trace this glyph in the air and stare down a beast or a monstrosity. The targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for as long as you continue staring at it. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] in this way, the creature must move at its full speed away from you on each of its turns until you can't see it or until it makes a successful saving throw. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. When a creature's saving throw is successful (regardless of whether it failed previously), it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn.

**Mastery Power:** If you spend 1 minute tracing this glyph on the body of an animal, you can grant yourself a measure of the animal's ability. You gain one of the following: a climbing or swimming speed of 30 feet, or a flying or burrowing speed of 20 feetâ€”whichever is most appropriate to the type of animal the bone came from. The effect lasts for as long as you maintain concentration, up to 1 hour.
