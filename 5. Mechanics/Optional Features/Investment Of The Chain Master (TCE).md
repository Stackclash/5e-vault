# Investment of the Chain Master
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 71*  

***Prerequisites*** Pact of the Chain

When you cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]], you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits:

- The familiar gains either a flying speed or a swimming speed (your choice) of 40 feet.  
- As a bonus action, you can command the familiar to take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action.  
- The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.  
- If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.  
- When the familiar takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant it resistance against that damage.
