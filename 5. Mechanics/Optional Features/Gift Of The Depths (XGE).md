*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 57*  

***Prerequisites*** 5th

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

You can also cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Water Breathing.md\|water breathing]] once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
