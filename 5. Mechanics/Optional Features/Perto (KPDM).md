*Things not as they seem, the god Loki*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom ability checks to solve riddles or puzzles, and on Wisdom saving throws against illusions.  
- **Power (4th level).** When you take an action to trace perto on a creature, you can change the creature's appearance as if by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Disguise Self.md\|disguise self]] spell. If the creature has Intelligence 3 or higher, it decides how to change its appearance. The effect persists for 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** Spending an action to trace perto on the ground causes all objects within 10 feet of the rune to be undetectable by divination magic or scrying sensors. The effect lasts for 8 hours.
