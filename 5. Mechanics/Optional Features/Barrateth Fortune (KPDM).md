# Barrateth (Fortune)
*Source: Deep Magic p. 179*  

The user can add 1 to an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. The addition is made after rolling the die but before the GM reveals whether it was a success or failure. *Greater:* After making an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, the user can roll another d20 and choose which result to use. The second roll is made after the initial roll but before the GM reveals whether that roll was a success or failure.

This seal can't be used again until the user finishes a short or long rest.
