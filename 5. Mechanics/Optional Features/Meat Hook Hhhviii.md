# Meat Hook
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 112*  

***Prerequisites*** 3rd-level Fighter (Butcher)

If you dealt piercing damage, you may make a grapple check against your target by lodging your weapon in your target's body as part of the same attack. While you have a creature grappled this way, you cannot make attacks with the weapon you used to grapple them. Whenever a creature grappled in this way attempts to escape the grapple and fails, they automatically suffer `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) piercing damage as they clumsily attempt to remove the weapon piercing them.
