# Pact of the Tome (The Sibyl)
*Source: Deep Magic p. 151*  

***Prerequisites*** "The Sibyl" Patron

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

## The Sibyl's Pact Boons

Your tome is an illuminated manuscript with depictions of ancestral prophets foretelling events to come. As your adventuring career progresses, new illuminations appear in the book's pages, displaying your notable actions in the service of your patron. While this book is on your person, your passive [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]] score is increased by 1 when being matched against enemy [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]] check results.
