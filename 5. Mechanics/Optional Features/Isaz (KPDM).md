# Isaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 240*  

*Ice, imprisonment, paralysis*

- **Benefit.** Whenever you take cold damage, that damage is reduced by 1.  
- **Power (4th level).** When you take an action to sketch isaz on the ground, slick ice spreads out from that point to cover an area of 225 square feet. The iced area can have any shape you want, as long as every square of ice has at least one side in common with another square of ice; on a grid of 5-foot squares, the ice can cover as many as 9 squares. Ice-filled squares are difficult terrain, and the DC of Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) checks made in the area increases by 5. The ice is nonmagical and melts normally.  
- **Power (5th level).** When isaz is traced on a weapon, the weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for 10 feet beyond that, and it deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) cold damage on a hit. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** A [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]] marked with this rune glitters like frost in the morning sun. As an action, a wielder of the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]] who is in direct sunlight can use it to focus reflected light on a single creature within 30 feet. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]]. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your Dexterity bonus + your proficiency bonus. Marking the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]] takes an action, and the rune remains effective while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.
