# Gifts Taken From the Silver Coffer
*Source: Deep Magic p. 217*  

This symbol represents gifts, knowledge, Secrets, and things hidden.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) checks.

**Power:** By spending 1 minute in concentration while holding a papyrus reed, you can cast the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Inanimate Object (KPDM).md\|speak with inanimate object]].

**Power (4th level)** By taking an action to break open an egg, you create an extradimensional space (a "silver coffer") that is 5 cubic feet in volume and can hold up to 50 pounds of material. This space looks like a simple, empty hole in the ground, but when you reach inside it, you always find whatever you placed inside. The extradimensional space remains visible as a hole in the ground for 24 hours, then disappears, along with its Contents. It can be reopened with another use of this hieroglyph power. The silver coffer's Location on the Material Plane depends on your Location when you trigger the hieroglyph. This power always opens the same extradimensional space no matter how much time passes or how far you travel between uses, so it's not a good way to dispose of, for example, unwanted or dangerous magic items. If the person who created the extradimensional space dies, any items in the silver coffer eventually reappear on their plane of Origin at a random Location, anytime from a day to several centuries after the creator's death.

**Mastery Power (10th level):** By taking an action to rub a Special brown paste over your eyes that costs 50 gp, you can cast True Seeing on yourself.
