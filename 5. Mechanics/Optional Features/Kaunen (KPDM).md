# Kaunen
*Source: Deep Magic p. 240*  

*Flaming torch, enlightenment, ulcers*

- **Benefit.** You gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 30 feet. If you already have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]], you gain proficiency on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks.  
- **Power (4th level).** When you spend 1 minute tracing kaunen on the ground, that spot burns like a campfire for up to 8 hours. The fire is 2 feet in diameter, and the flames deal `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage to any creature that ends its turn in the fire. It provides warmth as a campfire, but the flame cannot be transported or used to set other objects afire.  
- **Power (5th level).** Tracing kaunen onto a weapon causes that weapon to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for 10 feet beyond that, and the weapon deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage on a hit. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When you use an action to trace the rune on a living creature, kaunan produces the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] spell on that creature.
