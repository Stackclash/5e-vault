# Jera
*Source: Deep Magic p. 240*  

*Abundant harvest; the gods Frey and Freya*

- **Benefit.** You have proficiency on Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Nature\|Nature]]) checks.  
- **Power (4th level).** When jera is traced on the belly of a living creature, the rune guarantees that any sexual union involving that creature in the next 24 hours proves fruitful. If the rune is traced on a pregnant creature at least once per month during its pregnancy, the act guarantees a successful birth and healthy offspring. Tracing the rune takes an action.  
- **Power (6th level).** When jera is traced on a wooden table, plate, or platter, all food and drink that's spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated within 20 feet of that object becomes pure and safe for consumption. Tracing the rune takes an action.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When jera is drawn in the earth among living plants, the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plant Growth.md\|plant growth]] spell arises in a 100-foot radius around the rune. Sketching the rune takes an action.
