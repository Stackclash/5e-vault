# Mannaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 241*  

*Humanoids, especially [[5. Mechanics/Races/Human.md\|humans]] and [[5. Mechanics/Races/Dwarf.md\|dwarves]]*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrification]] and against effects that alter your form, such as lycanthropy, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Polymorph.md\|polymorph]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Flesh To Stone.md\|flesh to stone]].  
- **Power (5th level).** When mannaz is traced on the ground, a boulder, or a wall, it produces the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] spell on all living creatures within 20 feet of the rune. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When you use an action to trace mannaz on the flesh of a creature, the act returns a lycanthrope to its humanoid form or dispels (as if by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]]) a polymorph effect the target is currently under. An unwilling creature can resist this change with a successful Charisma saving throw (using your Wisdom modifier to set the DC).  
- **Mastery Power (9th level).** Tracing mannaz on a plant or animal causes it to be affected as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Awaken.md\|awaken]] spell. Drawing the rune in this way takes 8 hours, and the effect is permanent.
