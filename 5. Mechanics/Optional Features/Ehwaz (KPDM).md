# Ehwaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 238*  

*Horses, freedom, the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Nithing Pole (KPDM).md\|Nithing Pole]]*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Animal%20Handling\|Animal Handling]]) checks made to control a mount, and to Dexterity checks made to wriggle free of bonds.  
- **Power (5th level).** Using an action to trace ehwaz on a lock or a set of shackles has the same effect as casting a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Knock.md\|knock]] spell, but makes no sound.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** When you sketch ehwaz on the ground, you can produce the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Phantom Steed.md\|phantom steed]] spell. Sketching the rune takes 5 minutes, and the illusory steed remains for 1 hour or until it takes damage.  
- **Mastery Power (13th level).** You can create a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Nithing Pole (KPDM).md\|nithing pole]] once per month. The process can be performed only during a new moon, takes 12 hours, and requires bloodletting that leaves a permanent scar in the shape of the ehwaz rune on the rune maker's left hand. Each new use of this power creates a new scar; those after the first don't need to be on the hand, but they must be on the hands or arms.
