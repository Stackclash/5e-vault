***Prerequisites*** 3rd-level Monk (Observed Form)

Your vicious stance allows you to capitalise on your opponent's mistakes and punish them accordingly. Whenever you hit a creature with an opportunity attack while in this stance, you may immediately use your Flurry of Blows feature as a free action. You still need to spend 1 ki point to use it in this way.
