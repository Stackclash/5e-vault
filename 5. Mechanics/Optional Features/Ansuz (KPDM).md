# Ansuz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 237*  

*Gods and outsiders*

- **Benefit.** You gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) checks to identify the type, powers, or weaknesses of aberrations, celestials, fey, or fiends.  
- **Power.** Once per day, the ansuz rune can be sketched on an object to ward off giants and fey hostile to the Aesir. The object must be presented boldly toward such creatures, each of which must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must stay at least 5 feet away from the rune and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature presenting it, as long as the symbol is boldly and aggressively presented (which requires an action each round). Sketching the rune takes an action, and the marked object remains effective for 1 minute.  
- **Power (7th level).** If you sketch ansuz on a floor or a wall, each of your allies within 10 feet of it can roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and add the result to each of its attack rolls, similar to the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bless.md\|bless]] spell. Sketching the rune takes two actions, and it remains effective thereafter for as long as you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.  
- **Mastery Power (11th level).** When you trace ansuz on the forehead of a willing creature, the creature falls into a trance, during which it receives a message from the gods (identical in effect to a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Divination.md\|divination]] spell). A creature can experience only one such trance per week. Tracing the rune takes 10 minutes, and the trance lasts for 1 round.
