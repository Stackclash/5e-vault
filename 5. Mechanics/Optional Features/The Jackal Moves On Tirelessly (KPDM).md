**Power (3rd level)** If you take an action to trace this symbol on the body of a willing creature, you increase that creature's speed by 15 feet for 1 hour. This power affects all forms of Movement the creature can use.

**Mastery Power:** By drawing this hieroglyph on the ground over the course of 10 minutes, you create a temporary portal to another place within 1 mile that you're familiar with. You can step through the portal once, after which it disappears. You can bring along a number of other creatures equal to one-fourth your level (round up), provided all of them are your size or smaller and either willing or helpless.
