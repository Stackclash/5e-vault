# Drink Deep of the River's Power
*Source: Deep Magic p. 216*  

This hieroglyph represents the flow of magic through the land, as well as the physical flow of rivers.

**Benefit:** You gain the ability to cast one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence when you cast this cantrip.

**Power (2nd level)** You trace this hieroglyph over a creature's eyes in a ritual that takes 10 minutes to perform. When the ritual is complete, it produces a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] effect that works on the creature and on any items the creature is holding or carrying. The effect lasts for 1 minute while you maintain concentration.

**Mastery Power:** You trace this hieroglyph in dirt over the course of 1 hour. At the end of the hour, you dispel a magical effect of up to 4th level that is within 120 feet of you. If the effect is higher than 4th level, you dispel it if you make a successful Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check against a DC equal to 10 + the level of the effect.
