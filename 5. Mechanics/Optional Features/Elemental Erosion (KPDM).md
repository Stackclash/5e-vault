# Elemental Erosion
*Source: Deep Magic p. 152*  

***Prerequisites*** 10th

After you damage a target with a spell of 1st level or higher that deals the damage type associated with your elemental focus, the target becomes vulnerable to that damage type until the end of your next turn. You can use this ability twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
