# Infernal Ally
*Source: Devil's Advocate: A Guide to Infernal Contracts p. 22*  

- **Signing time.** varies  
- **Range.** 60 feet  
- **Components.** V, S, M (an infernal contract)  
- **Duration.** varies, up to 6 days  
- *You summon an infernal ally to assist you in your time of need*.  
- Choose a devil from the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Infernal Allies Da Gic.md\|Infernal Allies]] table corresponding to your character level. The devil appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. It lasts for 6 days, 6 hours, or up to 6 minutes, depending on the strength of the chosen fiend. The devil is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turn. It does its best to obey any verbal commands that you issue it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the devil, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the devil's statistics.  
- If summoning this devil results in your immediate death (i.e., surrendering your life as consideration), you can give your infernal ally a course of action to carry out in your absence, such as "Seek out and destroy my enemies." Additionally, you can denote a living party member or NPC to which the devil reports for the remainder of the duration.  
- ***Elevated 1, 2, or 3.*** When you choose this offer at service tier II or higher, your sacrifice entitles you to more powerful assistance. You may choose a devil as if you were a higher level character. For example, a 10th level character who sells their soul (service tier V, infernal ally - elevated 3) may choose a devil from the Infernal Allies table as if they were 13th level.
