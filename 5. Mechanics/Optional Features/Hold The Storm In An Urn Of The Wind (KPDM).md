# Hold the Storm in An Urn of the Wind
*Source: Deep Magic p. 218*  

This symbol represents the power of storms and wind and the effect these phenomena can have on the world.

**Benefit:** You can resist any effect or attack that would move you, causing you to be moved 5 feet less than the effect's normal distance.

**Power (3rd level)** By drawing this hieroglyph in the air for three consecutive turns (each one requiring an action), you gain the ability to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wind Wall.md\|wind wall]].

**Power (5th level)** After spending an hour in meditation with burning incense before tracing this hieroglyph in the air, you can cast a modified version of Control Weather. Unlike the spell, this power affects an area only a quarter-mile in radius, and the change lasts no longer than 20 minutes.

**Mastery Power:** Immediately after performing a 10-minute ritual with Special incense, you can cast a modified version of [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wind Wa(LK).md\|wind walk]]. Unlike the spell, this power affects up to five creatures, and the effect lasts for up to 2 hours and requires your concentration.
