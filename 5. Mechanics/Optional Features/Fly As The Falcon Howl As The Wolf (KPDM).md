# Fly as the Falcon, Howl as the Wolf
*Source: Deep Magic p. 217*  

This symbol represents hunting, Tracking, stalking, and bringing prey to the ground.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks.

**Power (2nd level)** When you use an action to trace this symbol on the body of a willing creature, the creature gains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 20 feet, which lasts for 1 minute and works even in magical Darkness.

**Power (4th level)** You trace this hieroglyph on an item that belongs to a specific creature or clearly represents a creature you have encountered, then use an action to consume it. For the next hour, the tracks of that creature glow in your sight. You can follow and track the creature automatically while moving at the speed of a forced march.

**Mastery Power:** By using an action to trace this glyph on your hand, you invoke the hunter's gift against a specific creature. The target must be a creature you have previously used one of this hieroglyph's powers against. The next time you hit the creature with an attack, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take an additional `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) necrotic damage from the attack.
