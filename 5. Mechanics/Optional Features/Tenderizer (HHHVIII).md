***Prerequisites*** 3rd Fighter (Butcher)

If you dealt bludgeoning damage, you may force your target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, your target suffers a devastating strike that breaks their strength and defences. Until the start of your next turn, your target has disadvantage on all Strength saving throws and Strength ability checks, and melee weapon attacks against them have advantage.
