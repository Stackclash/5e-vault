# Blind Fighting
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 41*  

You have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
