***Prerequisites*** Elemental focus (fire)

When you deal fire damage to a target with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to cause the target to catch fire. Unless a creature takes an action to douse the flames, at the start of its next turn, the target takes half the damage it originally took from the spell and the flames go out. If you damage more than one target with the spell, choose a target to catch fire.
