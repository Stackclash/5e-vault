# Elemental Command
*Source: Deep Magic p. 152*  

As an action, you can target an elemental creature that you can see within 30 feet. The elemental must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] for up to one hour as long as you maintain concentration as if concentrating on a spell. If you or your companions damage the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] elemental or take harmful actions against it, the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] condition ends immediately. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw, or if this ability ends for it, is immune to being charmed by you for 24 hours.
