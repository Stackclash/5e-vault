# Eiwaz
*Source: Deep Magic p. 239*  

*Yew tree, Yggdrasil*

- **Benefit.** You have proficiency on Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) checks.  
- **Power (4th level).** Spending an action to trace eiwaz onto a suitably sized piece of wood subjects it to the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shillelagh.md\|shillelagh]] spell for 1 minute. This power is usable at will.  
- **Mastery Power (8th level).** If you take 1 minute to write out three questions on a piece of paper or parchment and trace eiwaz on the bottom of the sheet, you can later produce an effect similar to a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contact Other Plane.md\|contact other plane]] spell (including the possible negative consequences). If you later sleep for at least 10 minutes while holding the sheet, your dreams yield answers to those questions that you can receive when you awaken if you make a successful Intelligence saving throw.  
- **Mastery Power (11th level).** When carved on the bark of a living tree, eiwaz allows you to travel between that tree and another tree within 500 feet that you have previously marked with eiwaz, as if both were under the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Tree Stride.md\|tree stride]] spell. Each carving takes an action, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute after the second carving is finished.
