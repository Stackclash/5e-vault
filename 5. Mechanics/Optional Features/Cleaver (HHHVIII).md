***Prerequisites*** 3rd Fighter (Butcher)

If you dealt slashing damage, you may force your target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, your target suffers a deep cut that shocks their system and hampers their combat capability. Until the start of your next turn, your target's speed is halved, and it makes all weapon attacks at disadvantage.
