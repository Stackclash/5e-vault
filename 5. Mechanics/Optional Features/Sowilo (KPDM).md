# Sowilo
*Source: Deep Magic p. 242*  

*The sun, the god Balder*

- **Benefit.** You gain immunity to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] condition.  
- **Power (5th level).** When traced on a creature, sowilo grants it magical confidence and magnetism, enabling it to use an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enthrall.md\|enthrall]] effect on an audience, as with the spell. Tracing the rune takes an action, and the effect lasts for 1 minute.  
- **Power (7th level).** Spending an action tracing sowilo on an object makes it glow, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Daylight.md\|daylight]] spell, for 1 hour.  
- **Mastery Power (13th level).** Spending an action drawing sowilo on the brow of a creature causes its eyes to emit a brilliant light, as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sunbeam.md\|sunbeam]] spell. The creature is immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] condition for the duration of the effect, which lasts while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.
