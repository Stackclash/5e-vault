# Raido
*Source: Deep Magic p. 242*  

*Travel*

- **Benefit.** Your speed is 5 feet faster than the norm for your race, and you always know which way is north.  
- **Power (4th level).** The possessor of an object that has had raido sketched on it has advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) checks to ski, skate, or control a sled. Sketching the rune in this way takes 1 minute, and the effect lasts while you concentrate, up to 1 hour.  
- **Power (5th level).** By using an action to trace raido on your skin, you bestow the benefit of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Water Wa(LK).md\|water walk]] spell on yourself and up to five other creatures of your choice that you can see.  
- **Power (7th level).** If you take 1 minute to sketch raido on the sole of your foot or boot, you gain the ability to engage in a forced march for 12 hours instead of the usual 8 hours before risking [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. You can impart this ability on up to five other creatures of your choice that you can see, but all of you must travel together for the entire period. The effect ends 12 hours after your forced march begins, regardless of whether you are traveling at that time.
