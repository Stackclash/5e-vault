*Source: Deep Magic p. 219*  

This symbol represents robust and vigorous health and the favor of the gods.

**Benefit:** Your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each Hit Die you have.

**Power:** When you take an action to trace this hieroglyph on a creature's skin with blood, that creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your Hit Dice.

**Mastery Power:** If you spend 1 minute repeatedly tracing this hieroglyph on the body of an afflicted creature, you can cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] on that creature.
