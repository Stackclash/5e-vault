# Dark Gift of Dahlver-Nar, He of the Many Teeth
*Charm*  

Dahlver-Nar's gift is the power to live many lives. Upon receiving this dark gift, the beneficiary instantly reincarnates when it dies, as though it was the target of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Reincarnate.md\|reincarnate]] spell. The new body appears within 10 feet of the old one. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary of this dark gift loses all of its teeth until it reincarnates for the third and final time.
