# Charm of Restoration

This charm has 6 charges. You can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] (4 charges) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] (2 charges). Once all its charges have been expended, the charm vanishes from you.
