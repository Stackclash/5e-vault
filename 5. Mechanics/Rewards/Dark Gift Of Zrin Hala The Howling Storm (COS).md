# Dark Gift of Zrin-Hala, the Howling Storm
*Charm*  

Zrin-Hala's gift is the power to create lightning. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lightning Bolt.md\|lightning bolt]] spell as an action. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes.

As soon as this dark gift is received, one side of the beneficiary's face sags and loses all feeling.
