# Dark Gift of Vaund the Evasive
*Charm*  

Vaund's gift is the power of evasion. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the benefits of an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of Proof Against Detection And Location.md|amulet of proof against detection and location]] and a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Evasion.md|ring of evasion]]. These benefits last for 10 days, after which the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary of this dark gift becomes twitchy and nervous, and also gains the following flaw: "I can't give a straight answer to any question put to me."
