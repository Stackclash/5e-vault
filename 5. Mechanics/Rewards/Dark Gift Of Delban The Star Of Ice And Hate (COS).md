# Dark Gift of Delban, the Star of Ice and Hate
*Charm*  

Delban's gift is the power to unleash deadly cold. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [[5. Mechanics\Spells\Cone Of Cold.md|cone of cold]] spell as an action. After it has been used seven times, the dark gift vanishes. Until it vanishes, the beneficiary also gains the benefits of a [[5. Mechanics\Items\Ring Of Warmth.md|ring of warmth]].

The beneficiary of this dark gift gains the following flaw: "Fire terrifies me."
