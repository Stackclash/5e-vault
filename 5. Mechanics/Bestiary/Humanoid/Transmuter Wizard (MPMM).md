Transmuters are masters at transforming physical forms. They typically view magical transmutation as a path to riches, enlightenment, or apotheosis.

## Wizards

Wizards pursue magical power through the study of arcane texts. Some travel the world searching for esoteric tomes while others train lesser wizards or collaborate with colleagues to create new spells.
