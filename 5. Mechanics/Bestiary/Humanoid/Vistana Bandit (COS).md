    \ or casting spells that have somatic components. When this curse ends, the Vistana\
    \ takes dice: 1d6|avg (1d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target's appearance changes\
    \ in a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar\
    \ on the target's face, turn the target's teeth into yellow fangs, or give the\
    \ target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes dice: 1d6|avg (1d6)\
    \ psychic damage.  \n- A nonmagical item in the target's possession (chosen by\
    \ the DM) disappears and can't be found until the curse ends. The lost item can\
    \ weigh no more than 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes dice: 1d6|avg\
    \ (1d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target gains vulnerability to a damage type\
    \ of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes dice: 3d6|avg\
    \ (3d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target has disadvantage on ability checks and\
    \ saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana's choice. When this curse\
    \ ends, the Vistana takes dice: 3d6|avg (3d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target's\
    \ attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can't attune\
    \ to the chosen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes\

    \ [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#deafened|deafened]], or both. When this curse\
    \ ends, the Vistana takes dice: 5d6|avg (5d6) psychic damage.  \n\nThe curse\
    \ lasts until ended with a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md|greater restoration]]\
    \ spell, a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md|remove curse]] spell, or similar\
    \ magic. It doesn't end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to\
