# [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Humanoid\Spy.md|Spy]]
*Source: Monster Manual p. 349, Curse of Strahd. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*

Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.
