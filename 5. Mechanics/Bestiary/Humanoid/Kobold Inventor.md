*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 164*  

A kobold inventor builds improvised weapons to gain an advantage in combat. These weapons last for only one or two attacks before they break and typically work only for the inventor, but they might be surprisingly effective in the meantime. The weapons don't have to be lethalâ€”often one serves its purpose if it distracts, scares, or confuses a creature long enough for the inventor to kill that foe.

- "desc": "The kobold uses one of the following options (choose one or roll a dice:\
    \ d8|avg (d8)); the kobold can use each one no more than once per day:\n\n\
    - 1 Acid. The kobold hurls a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Acid Vial.md|flask of acid]].\
    \ Ranged Weapon Attack: dice: d20+4 (+4 to hit), range 5/20 ft., one target.\
    \ Hit: dice: 2d6|avg (2d6) acid damage.  \n- 2 Alchemist's Fire. The\
    \ kobold throws a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Fire Flask.md|flask of alchemist's fire]].\
    \ Ranged Weapon Attack: dice: d20+4 (+4 to hit), range 5/20 ft., one target.\
    \ Hit: dice: 1d4|avg (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target's\
    \ turns. The target can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity\
    \ check to extinguish the flames.  \n- 3 Basket of Centipedes. The kobold\
    \ throws a small basket into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A [swarm\
    \ of insects (centipedes)](compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-centipedes.md) with\
    \ 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each\
    \ of the swarm's turns, there's a 50% chance chance that the swarm disperses.\
    \  \n- 4 Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime\
    \ at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: dice:\
    \ d20+4 (+4 to hit), range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: dice: 1d10|avg (1d10)\
    \ acid damage, and the target is covered in slime until a creature uses its action\
    \ to scrape or wash the slime off. A target covered in the slime takes dice:\
    \ 1d10|avg (1d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.  \n- 5 Rot\
    \ Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20\
    \ feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Rot Grubs.md|swarm of rot grubs]]\
    \ (in this book) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.\
    \  \n- 6 Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Scorpion.md|scorpion]]\
    \ tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: dice: d20+4\
    \ (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target\
    \ must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking dice: 1d8|avg (1d8) poison\
    \ damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- 7\
    \ Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point,\
    \ and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action\
    \ to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed\
    \ on a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, or it retches and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated|incapacitated]]\
    \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn't need\
    \ to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw.\
    \ Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes\
    \ a short or long rest.  \n- 8 Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small\
    \ bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Wasps.md|swarm of insects (wasps)]]\
    \ with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of\
    \ each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50% chance chance that the swarm disperses.\
