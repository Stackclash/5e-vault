    \ with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target\
    \ is within 5 feet of an ally of the spy that isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated|incapacitated]]\

- "desc": "13\n\n- The target is unable to perform a certain kind of act involving\
    \ fine motor control, such as tying knots, writing, playing an instrument, sewing,\
    \ or casting spells that have somatic components. When this curse ends, the Vistana\
    \ takes dice: 1d6|avg (1d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target's appearance changes\
    \ in a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar\
    \ on the target's face, turn the target's teeth into yellow fangs, or give the\
    \ target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes dice: 1d6|avg (1d6)\
    \ psychic damage.  \n- A nonmagical item in the target's possession (chosen by\
    \ the DM) disappears and can't be found until the curse ends. The lost item can\
    \ weigh no more than 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes dice: 1d6|avg\
    \ (1d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target gains vulnerability to a damage type\
    \ of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes dice: 3d6|avg\
    \ (3d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target has disadvantage on ability checks and\
    \ saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana's choice. When this curse\
    \ ends, the Vistana takes dice: 3d6|avg (3d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target's\
    \ attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can't attune\
    \ to the chosen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes\
    \ dice: 5d6|avg (5d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded|blinded]],\
    \ [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#deafened|deafened]], or both. When this curse\
    \ ends, the Vistana takes dice: 5d6|avg (5d6) psychic damage.  \n\nThe curse\
    \ lasts until ended with a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md|greater restoration]]\
    \ spell, a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md|remove curse]] spell, or similar\
    \ magic. It doesn't end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to\
    \ life, the curse remains in effect."
  "name": "Curse (Recharges After a Long Rest)"
- "desc": "13\n\nA Vistana who uses Evil Eye can't use it again before finishing a\
    \ short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against a Vistana's\
    \ Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all Vistani for 24 hours."
