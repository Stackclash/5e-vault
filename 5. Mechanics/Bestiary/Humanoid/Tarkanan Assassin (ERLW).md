# [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Humanoid\Tarkanan Assassin (ERLW).md|Tarkanan Assassin]]
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 320*  

Tarkanan assassins are the elite killers, spies, and thieves who work for House Tarkanan, a criminal organization specializing in theft and assassination. In addition to their deadly skill, a Tarkanan assassin possesses an aberrant dragonmarkâ€”a twisted sigil that provides them with magical power. House Tarkanan actively seeks and recruits people with aberrant dragonmarks.

> [!note] Aberrant Dragonmark Innate Spells
> 
> The power granted by an aberrant dragonmark is unpredictable. When running a Tarkanan assassin, you can roll on the Aberrant Dragonmark Innate Spells table to determine the spells gained from that NPC's aberrant mark, replacing the spells in the stat block's Innate Spellcasting trait.
