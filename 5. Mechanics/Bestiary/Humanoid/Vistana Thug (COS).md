    \ the DM) disappears and can't be found until the curse ends. The lost item can\

    \ (3d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target has disadvantage on ability checks and\
    \ saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana's choice. When this curse\

    \ to the chosen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes\
    \ dice: 5d6|avg (5d6) psychic damage.  \n- The target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded|blinded]],\
    \ [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#deafened|deafened]], or both. When this curse\
    \ ends, the Vistana takes dice: 5d6|avg (5d6) psychic damage.  \n\nThe curse\

    \ spell, a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md|remove curse]] spell, or similar\
