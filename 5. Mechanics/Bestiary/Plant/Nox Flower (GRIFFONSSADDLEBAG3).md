# [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Plant\Nox Flower (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md|Nox Flower]]
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 3 p. 0*

The nox flower was originally created in the Safire Wood as a misguided attempt to stem the tide of the Midas Tree's expansion on the fey plane.

## Devious Pollinators

Nox flowers wander about constantly on their tiny root legs, searching for ways to carve out space and soil for their seeds to spread. Their entire life cycle is centered on this goalâ€”even their destruction causes a burst of poisonous pollen and seeds to take root at the site of their death.

## Elemental Absorption

Alongside the pollen and seeds, the death of a nox flower releases whatever elemental energy that particular flower managed to collect during its lifespan. They gather the energy from the soil and other sources based on the particular strain of flower, reflected by the color of its petals. Energy that corresponds to their kind is also less potent against these tiny plants, as they absorb a portion of the element's power..

## Growth in Numbers

Nox flowers are not exactly social, as they have no language, but they do tend to gather and swarm with other flowers of the same element and color. When swarming, these pesky plants become significantly more dangerous, capable of expelling their destructive pollen more often to harm enemies nearby.
