# [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Undead\Strahd Zombie (COS).md|Strahd Zombie]]
*Source: Curse of Strahd p. 241*

Strahd zombies are undead that serve the vampire Strahd von Zarovich. Created from the long-dead guards of Castle Ravenloft, they were called into being through dark magic by Strahd himself.

## Loathsome Limbs

A Strahd zombie's gray-green flesh looks soft, and its bones seem brittle. Any good hit from a bludgeoning or slashing weapon severs part of the zombie's body. Strahd zombies are suffused with horrible necromantic magic that allows their severed body parts to continue to attack. All parts of a Strahd zombie are considered one and the same creature, so damage to any part damages the whole creature.

## Undead Nature

A Strahd zombie doesn't require air or sleep.

      \ the zombie's hit points.\n\nA severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed\
      \ of 5 feet.\n\nA severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack\
