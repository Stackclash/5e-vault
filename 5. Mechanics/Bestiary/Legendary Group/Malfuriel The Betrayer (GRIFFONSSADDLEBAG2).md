# Malfuriel the Betrayer

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), Malfuriel can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- A stream of blood opens up on the ground originating at a point Malfuriel chooses within 60 feet of him. The stream is 30 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice outside the stream. On a failed save, the creature falls into the stream and takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) necrotic damage. A creature that starts its turn in the stream must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become diseased (see the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Bloodmire Diseases (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md|Bloodmire Diseases]] table).  
- A pillar of unholy flame bursts from the ground. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point Malfuriel chooses within 60 feet of him must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) fire damage and `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
