# Ancient Sapphire Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- The dragon manifests [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Flay (SAF).md|flay]] in a 120-foot cone, doing 1d6 damage per charge spent.  
- The dragon manifests [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Reflection (SAF).md|reflection]] at no cost. It cannot use this action again for a week.  
- The dragon casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md|plane shift]] with DC 22.  

## Regional effects


Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of a sapphire dragon's lair dream of the past and future. They know the things they see in these dreams are real events that have, or will, occur.
