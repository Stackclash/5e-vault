# Ancient Emerald Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- The dragon summons a water elemental.  
- The dragon casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Control Water.md|control water]] (save DC 22). It does not require concentration to maintain.  
- The dragon casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Thunderwave.md|thunderwave]] with DC 22. The area is a 30-foot cube, and the damage is 4d8.  

## Regional effects


Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of an emerald dragon's lair dream of unending depths, tidal waves, starfish and crustaceans, or a calm sea under solid white sky with constellations under the waters.
