# Ancient Amethyst Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- The dragon manifests [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Believe (SAF).md|believe]] at no cost.  
- The dragon manifests [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Forget (SAF).md|forget]] at no cost. If it forces the target to forget a spell, the dragon knows that spell and can cast it using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability, with a DC of 23.  
- The dragon manifests an illusion of a shifting battlefield. The terrain within 30 feet of it is considered difficult terrain until the end of the dragon's next turn.  

## Regional effects


Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of an amethyst dragon's lair dream of an opulent party with a charming host to whom they willingly and happily reveal their deepest secrets.
