# Demogorgon

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Demogorgon can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Darkness.** Demogorgon casts the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Darkness.md|darkness]] spell four times, targeting different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Illusory Duplicate.** Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or an object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, by hitting him with an attack), there is a 50% chance chance that the illusory duplicate is affected, not Demogorgon, in which case the illusion disappears.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Demogorgon's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Beguiling Realm.** Within 6 miles of the lair, all Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion|Persuasion]]) and Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance|Performance]]) checks have disadvantage, and all Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception|Deception]]) and Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation|Intimidation]]) checks have advantage.  
- **Frenzied Animals.** Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frenzied and violentâ€”even creatures that are normally docile. Within that area, any ability check involving Animal Handling has disadvantage.  
- **Venomous Beasts.** The area within 6 miles of the lair becomes overpopulated with [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Poisonous Snake.md|poisonous snakes]] and other venomous Beasts.  

If Demogorgon dies, these effects fade over the course of `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) days.
