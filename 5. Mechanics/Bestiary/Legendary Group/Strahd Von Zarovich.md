# Strahd von Zarovich

## Lair actions
_Source: Curse of Strahd_

While Strahd is in Castle Ravenloft, he can take lair actions as long as he isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated|incapacitated]].

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Strahd can take one of the following lair action options, or forgo using any of them in that round:

- Until initiative count 20 of the next round, Strahd can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if they weren't there.  
- Strahd targets any number of doors and windows that he can see, causing each one to either open or close as he wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (needing a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until Strahd chooses to end the effect, or until Strahd uses this lair action again.  
- Strahd summons the angry spirit of one who has died in the castle. The apparition appears next to a hostile creature that Strahd can see, makes an attack against that creature, and then disappears. The apparition has the statistics of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Specter.md|specter]].  
- Strahd targets one Medium or smaller creature that casts a shadow. The target's shadow must be visible to Strahd and within 30 feet of him. If the target fails a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, its shadow detaches from it and becomes a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Shadow.md|shadow]] that obeys Strahd's commands, acting on initiative count 20. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md|greater restoration]] spell or a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md|remove curse]] spell cast on the target restores its natural shadow, but only if its undead shadow has been destroyed.
