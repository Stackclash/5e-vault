# Lothrem, the Wreathed Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Lothrem takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Each creature of Lothrem's choice within 60 feet of them gains the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sanctuary.md|sanctuary]] spell. This effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Lothrem casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wind Wall.md|wind wall]], without material components.  
- Lothrem chooses a point on the ground that they can see within 120 feet of them, causing grasping weeds and vines to sprout from the ground in a 30-foot radius centered on that point. For 1 minute, the area is under the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Entangle.md|entangle]] spell. This effect ends early if Lothrem uses this lair action again or if they die.  

## Regional effects


The region containing Lothrem's lair is warped by their draconic magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Each creature that has the ability to cast at least one spell can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Druidcraft.md|druidcraft]] cantrip at will while within 6 miles of Lothrem's lair.  
- The weather within 6 miles of the lair is substantially affected by Lothrem's current state of mind (see [Lothrem's Mood & Weather](compendium/tables/crest-city-weather-patterns-griffonssaddlebag2.md) table).  

Ivy and other vines are prevalent on stone structures and protecting them against the elements. In addition, while Lothrem is within their lair, grass and flowers continuously grow beneath them, as if under the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Druidcraft.md|druidcraft]] spell.
