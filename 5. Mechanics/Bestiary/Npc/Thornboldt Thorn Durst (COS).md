    \ effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]]\
    \ and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]]. It otherwise uses\
    \ the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge,\
    \ class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession lasts until the body drops\
    \ to 0 hit points, Thorn ends it as a bonus action, or Thorn is turned or forced\
    \ out by an effect like the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Evil And Good.md\|dispel evil and good]]\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, Thorn reappears in an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours\
    \ after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
