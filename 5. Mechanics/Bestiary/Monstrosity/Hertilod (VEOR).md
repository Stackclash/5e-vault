When a dead god is left adrift in the Astral Sea, its corpse sometimes spawns a parasitic monster known as a hertilod. Voracious and terrifying, a hertilod resembles a skinless, serpentine lizard, with sharp claws and a gaping maw that drips venom. A hertilod's gruesomely exposed muscle renders it susceptible to lightning.
