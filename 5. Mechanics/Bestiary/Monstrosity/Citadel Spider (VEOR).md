Lolth's followers breed spiders of all types and sizes, infusing the creatures with foul energy from the Demonweb Pits. Perhaps the most feared of such abominations is the citadel spider. The titanic citadel spider serves as a powerhouse weapon and mobile command post. Wedges of chitin atop a citadel spider's back shield passengers and protect the spider's biological cannon. A citadel spider can launch globs of acidic webbing from its cannon that hold victims in place until the spider can eviscerate them with its serrated jaws.
