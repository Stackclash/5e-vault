# [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Cosmos Kraken (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md|Cosmos-Kraken]]
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 3 p. 0*

A space-faring kraken of scarcely-imaginable proportions. Few things have been known to stand, swim, or float in its way throughout known time. Fleets of cosmos-ready ships have crumbled under their might.

  "name": "Freedom of Movement"
- "desc": "The kraken is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read\

    \ which fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone|prone]] in a space within\
    \ 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer\

- "desc": "One Large or smaller object held or creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled|grappled]]\
    \ by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone|prone]].\
    \ If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning\

  "name": "Fling"
- "desc": "The kraken magically emits a flurry of psionic energy affecting each creature\

    \ there must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison\
