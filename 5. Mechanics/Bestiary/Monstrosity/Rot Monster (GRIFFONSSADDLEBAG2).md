# [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Monstrosity\Rot Monster (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md|Rot Monster]]
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 362*

Considered a cousin to rust monsters in behavior if not biology, the rot monster thrives on spoiled, contaminated, or rotting food and drinksâ€”consuming them without suffering any ill effects. Its appearance is not unlike a featherless, scaly-skinned vulture, though its wings are almost vestigial. A vicious scavenger, it is willing to stalk living prey when the pickings are slim. In this instance, it shows a terrifying ability to rapidly putrefy organic material with its talons.
