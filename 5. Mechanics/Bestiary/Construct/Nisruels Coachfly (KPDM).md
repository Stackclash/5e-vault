# [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Construct\Nisruels Coachfly (KPDM).md|Nisruel's Coachfly]]
*Source: Deep Magic p. 287*

*This long, narrow contraption resembles a clockwork dragonfly that's larger than a horse. It is fashioned from silver and lapis lazuli, with panes of delicate-looking multicolored stained glass for wings. The back of the construct contains a hollow that looks like it could hold one or more occupants.*

Decades ago, the noble half-elf wizard Nisruel created a beautiful clockwork construct fashioned after the enormous dragonflies of her marshy homeland. Though she was usually content to teleport when she wanted to go somewhere, sometimes Nisruel wanted to travel in styleâ€”so she crafted this construct to impress her friends and others in the elven court. Word of her wondrous carriage spread throughout the land shortly after she revealed it, and Nisruel enjoyed receiving recognition for her work. Sadly, her fame also drew the ire of her rival, the sorceress Ymelda, who lured Nisruel and her construct into the web of a gargantuan spider before ambushing the wizard with foul magic. Both Nisruel and Ymelda died in this struggle, but Nisruel's construct survived intact, and it still lies caught up in the webs of the great arachnid, awaiting rescue.
