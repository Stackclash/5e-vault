*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 209*

Blade scouts are responsible for exploring and charting Mournland regions not yet claimed by the Lord of Blades' legions.

## Blades of Eberron

In the aftermath of Eberron's Last War, a warforged called the Lord of Blades rose to fill the power vacuum left in the devastated Mournland. The Lord of Blades' followers, known as blades, formed a cult of personality that deifies the Lord of Blades and preaches a bloody, jingoistic doctrine of warforged superiority. The primary tenet of the blades is that non-warforged on the continent of Khorvaire must be slaughtered.
