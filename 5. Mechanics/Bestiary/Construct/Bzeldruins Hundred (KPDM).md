# [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Construct\Bzeldruins Hundred (KPDM).md|Bzeldruin's Hundred]]
*Source: Deep Magic p. 286*

*Spread out across the ground before you is an impressive collection of close to a hundred wooden miniatures. Each figure resembles an adult male, an adult female, or a child. Most seem to be human, but you can see elves, dwarves, halflings, and even a few centaurs and other creatures scattered among them. As soon as you notice them, the figures begin to mimic your every movement.*

Bzeldruin's Hundred is a group of one hundred wooden miniature figures created by the gnomish transmuter Bzeldruin Tiwaskar to represent his friends and family. Bzeldruin created them in celebration of his life's many achievements, but their creation was flawed and they became inhabited by an evil spirit that sought to slay the very people they were modeled after. Unable to bring himself to destroy them, Bzeldruin tried to seal them away in the depths of his towerâ€”and although he succeeded, the effort cost him his life. Now his tower lies deserted, enticing explorers with the promise of powerful magic if they can overcome the horrors within.

- "desc": "Any Medium or smaller creature damaged by the swarm must make a DC 15 Strength\

    \ Dexterity checks. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns,\
    \ ending the effect on itself on a success."
