*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 239*

Compared to other animated objects, whirling chandeliers seem to have capricious personalities. Victims typically perceive a whirling chandelier's Blazing Vortex as mischievousness or outright malevolence, though the chandelier lacks any understanding of such concepts. A whirling chandelier makes tactical decisions only as a means to perform its master's orders to the best of its ability.
