Moonlight guardians are gleaming bipedal statues made of silver and mithral. They were originally created by a desperate mage on Krynn who drew the Moon card from a Deck of Many Things. The mage wished for a retinue of bodyguards ideally suited to fighting lycanthropes and other shapeshifting creatures. In response, the Moon card spawned the first moonlight guardian.

A moonlight guardian's body is infused with magical moonlight that the creature can channel into its blows. It can also unleash searing blasts of lunar energy that can expose shapeshifters by forcing them into their true forms.
