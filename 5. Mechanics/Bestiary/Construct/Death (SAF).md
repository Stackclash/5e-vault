All things must end. The Inexorability of Death is not concerned exclusively with ending lifeâ€”its purview covers all things. Civilizations, ideas, stories. All things end.

Death does not cause this ending, it enforces it. It arrives ready to stop something or someone trying to undo the Law of Death. Therefore, it focuses most on the undead, on those things persisting after their natural end.

It also has the power to prevent a creature from meeting its end before its time. Why it is granted the power to use magic, when magic is chaos and therefore anathema to the Inexorables, is a question Death does not know the answer to. It only knows it can prevent.

## Tactics

This thing is powerful, but not hard to run. Its Law of Death radiates damage to undead, and its Death to Undeath ability has an obvious use. But if there aren't any undead around, it'll happily wade into combat for you, just smashing things with its hammer-like fists.
