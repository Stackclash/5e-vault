# Grasping Seedling Necklace
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Grasping-Seedling-Necklace.webp#right)  


This necklace features a tiny teardrop glass bauble connected to a metal stopper. It hangs from a plain string or bit of leather cording. Inside the bauble is a single seed, which grows a little bit each day and into a small seedling. The seedling gains 1 charge daily at dawn, up to a maximum of 7 charges. The seedling has 1 leaf for each charge it has. When found, it has `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) charges.

If the seedling has 7 charges, you can use an action to detach the necklace's bauble from its metal stopper and speak the exposed seed's command word. You can throw the seedling into an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you as part of this action, where it immediately takes root and grows into a grasping mass of creeping vines. Each Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of the seedling's space when it lands must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by the vines for 1 minute. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the vines on a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] creature (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect on that creature.

The vines wither away and are destroyed after 1 minute. When they do, there is a 50 percent chance that they leave behind a new seed. You can place the seed in the necklace's empty glass bauble to begin growing it into a seedling once again.
