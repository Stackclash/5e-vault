# Skelekey
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Skelekey.webp#right)  


This weathered metal key rattles in your hand, as if it's not entirely solid. At its center is a stylized skull with a pair of small, glimmering gems in its eye sockets.

This key can be used to open any lock that has a lockpicking DC of 25 or lower. If a lock is under the effects of arcane lock, it ignores the benefits of that spell on the lock. If a lock or locked object is trapped, opening it with this key also prevents the trap from being triggered.

Each time the key is used to open a lock, one of its gems becomes dull and cracked. Once both gems are cracked, the key loses its magic.
