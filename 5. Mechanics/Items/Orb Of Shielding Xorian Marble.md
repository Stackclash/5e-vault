# Orb of Shielding (Xorian Marble)
*Generic Variant, common (requires attunement)*  


An orb of shielding is a polished, spherical chunk of crystal or stone aligned to one of the planes of existence. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this orb as a spellcasting focus.

If you're holding the orb when you take psychic damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) (to a minimum of 0).
