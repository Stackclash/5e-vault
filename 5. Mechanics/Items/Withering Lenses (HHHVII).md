# Withering Lenses
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing these lenses, you may target a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, suffering `dice:8d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half that on a success. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target instead takes `dice:64|noform|noparens|avg` (`64`) necrotic damage. The target dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this ability.

Once used, this ability may not be used again until the next dawn.
