# Ring of Fire
*Ring, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Fire.webp#right)  


This ring is made of magical fire. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Fire.md\|wall of fire]] spell (spell save DC 15).

When cast from the ring, the wall must be in a circle centered on you. The *wall of fire* is 20 feet tall and 1 foot thick.
