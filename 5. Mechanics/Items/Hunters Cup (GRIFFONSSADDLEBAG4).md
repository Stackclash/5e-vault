# Hunter's Cup
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Hunters-Cup.webp#right)  


This wooden goblet is covered in a soft layer of moss. Three twisted antlers encircle it. It holds 1 cup of liquid.

When the goblet is filled from a free-flowing stream or pond, it begins to glow with a soft energy. Drinking the full goblet of glowing water using an action grants you the following benefits until you finish a short or long rest (to a maximum of 24 hours):

- You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks and Wisdom checks.  
- You gain a +2 bonus to the damage rolls of your ranged weapon attacks.  
- Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.  
- Any bonus granted by the goblet is doubled while you're within a forest.  

The water in the goblet ceases to glow after 24 hours or if it's moved more than 100 feet away from where it was filled. Once a creature has drunk from the goblet in this way, it can't be used again until `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) days have passed.
