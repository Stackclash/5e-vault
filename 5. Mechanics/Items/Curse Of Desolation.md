# Curse of Desolation
*Curse, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:

## Curse:

> [!quote]-  
> 
> While attuned to this item you become cursed. While cursed in this way, you have an aversion to sunlight and take 5 radiant damage whenever you start your turn in sunlight or enter sunlight for the first time in a turn. While in sunlight, you also have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. In addition, you exude a necrotic aura around you that deals 5 necrotic damage to any creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of you. Undead and fiends ignore this aura.
> 
> This curse ends permanently on both the item and you if the remove curse spell or similar magic is cast on either you or the cursed item.
