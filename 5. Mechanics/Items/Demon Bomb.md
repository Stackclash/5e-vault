# Demon Bomb
*Explosive, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This bomb is a black iron sphere filled with balor ashes and explosive elements and is roughly the size of an orange. You may spend an action to light and throw this item at a point within 20 feet. At the end of your next turn, this item will explode, forcing all creatures within 20 feet of it to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 15d6|avg` (`15d6`) fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The explosion ignites flammable objects in this area that aren't being worn or carried.
