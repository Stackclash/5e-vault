# Stone Anvil
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This large anvil has been crafted partly out of the molar of a stone giant. This anvil is magically enchanted so that sufficiently heated stones that have been placed on it act like heated metal. The stone is able to be shaped in much the same way as heated metal can, and then resumes its original stone properties once removed from the anvil.
