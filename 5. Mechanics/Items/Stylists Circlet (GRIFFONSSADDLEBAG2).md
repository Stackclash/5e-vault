# Stylist's Circlet
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Stylists-Circlet.webp#right)  


While wearing this leather circlet, you can use a bonus action to change your hair's length, color, and styling. When you remove the circlet, your hair returns to its natural appearance. Your hair can grow up to 5 feet long in this way, and any hair you cut off immediately vanishes.
