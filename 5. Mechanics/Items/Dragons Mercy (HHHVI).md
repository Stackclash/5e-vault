# Dragon's Mercy
*Wondrous item*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This leathery pouch is repurposed from a dragon's secondary breath pouch and has had some of its potency reduced in exchange for long term usability. While holding this item, you may spend an action to squeeze the bag, creating an effect identical to the non-damaging breath weapon of the dragon from whom this item was crafted (refer to the "Monster Manual" for the exact stats).

Once this item has been used once, it cannot be used again for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) hours.
