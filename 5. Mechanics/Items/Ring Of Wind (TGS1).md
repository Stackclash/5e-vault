# Ring of Wind
*Ring, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Wind.webp#right)  


This ring is made of magical wind. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wind Wall.md\|wind wall]] spell (spell save DC 13).

When cast from the ring, the wall must be in a circle centered on you. The *wind wall* is 15 feet tall and 1 foot thick.
