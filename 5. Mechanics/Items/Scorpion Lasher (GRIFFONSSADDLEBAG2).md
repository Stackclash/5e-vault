This whip was constructed using salvaged pieces of a giant scorpion and drips with a sickly venom. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can cause the whip to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) poison damage. When you do, if the creature is Medium or smaller, it must also succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet closer to you.
