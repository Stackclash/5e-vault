# Wand of Steam
*Wand, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wand-of-Steam.webp#right)  


The shaft of this wand is a clear glass tube filled with bubbling water. This wand has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]] spell from it, which has the following changes:

When cast, the wand emits a spray of superheated mist in a 30-foot cone from it. Creatures within the cone must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.

Choose a point within the cone of steam. The sphere of fog created by the spell forms immediately after the cone of steam is released from the wand, centered on that point.

The spell has a duration of 1 minute, instead of 1 hour.

If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand disappears in a plume of steam and is destroyed.
