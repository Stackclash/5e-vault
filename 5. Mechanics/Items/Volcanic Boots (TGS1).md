# Volcanic Boots
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Volcanic-Boots.webp#right)  


These heavy volcanic stones rearrange themselves to better fit your feet once you've attuned to them. Despite their appearance, the boots are comfortably light and warm. While wearing the boots, you have resistance to fire damage.

The boots have 10 charges and regain `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you walk at least 5 feet on solid ground while wearing the boots, you can expend 1 or more of their charges as part of that movement. Choose an unoccupied space you just walked through for each expended charge: the ground and air in a 5-foot cube within that space becomes volcanic and impossibly hot. Any creature other than you that enters or starts its turn in that space must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage.

The volcanic effect lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early as a bonus action or fall unconscious.
