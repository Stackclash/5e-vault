# Sahuagin Sabatons
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Sahuagin-Sabatons.webp#right)  


These armored sabatons fit neatly over any boot or shoe you're already wearing. While wearing them, you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. If you already have a swimming speed, wearing the sabatons increases that speed by 15 feet.
