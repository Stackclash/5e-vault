# Demon Light
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this jewels, you gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Truesight\|truesight]] out to a range of 120 feet and telepathy out to 120 feet. Also, you may spend an action to cause it to emit a scintillating, multicoloured light. Each creature within 15 feet of the item that can see the light must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
