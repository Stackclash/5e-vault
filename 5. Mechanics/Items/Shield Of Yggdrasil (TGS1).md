# Shield of Yggdrasil
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, very rare (requires attunement by a creature with a Strength score of 17 or higher)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shield-of-Yggdrasil.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You must have a Strength of 17 or higher in order to wield this massive, magical tower shield. The shield is of dwarven make and functions as a small battlement, granting you an additional +1 bonus to your AC while you wield it. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

## Shield Plant

As a bonus action, you can plant this shield on the ground to barricade yourself behind it, granting you half cover against ranged attacks from the direction you're facing. While you wield the planted shield, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take from nonmagical weapons is reduced by 3, but your movement speed becomes 5 feet. You can uproot the shield to end this effect as an action.

You can doff the shield when planting it by using an action to do so instead of a bonus action. The shield magically remains upright and in place and can be used as half cover to any creature standing immediately behind it in the space it was left in. The shield falls down when you fall unconscious or when knocked over following a successful DC 20 Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) check. You can move the shield while it's planted by donning the shield again.

This shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. You can expend 1 charge when you plant this shield or later on a subsequent turn as a bonus action to send out metal roots along the ground in a 10-foot radius, centered on the shield. Enemy creatures treat this area as difficult terrain. Moving the shield also moves the roots. The roots remain until you uproot the shield or it falls over.
