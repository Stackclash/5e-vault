# Hexaxe
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Handaxe.md\|handaxe]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement by a warlock)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Hexaxe.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 S
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This handaxe amplifies curses bestowed on its enemies. The weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While you're holding the axe and are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a warlock spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the axe's charges to add your Charisma modifier to the total of the saving throw.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against creatures under the effects of a warlock spell you cast that requires concentration.
