# Deathmetal Axe
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greataxe.md\|greataxe]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Deathmetal-Axe.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

This adamantine axe is covered in narrow cracks, which periodically erupt with harmless, magical flame. Along its haft are four strings: plucking a string creates a deep, bone-rattling resonance from the axe. If you're proficient with lutes, you are proficient with the deathmetal axe, and you can play it as if it were a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lute.md\|lute]].

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, as well as on any Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) check you make with it. Whenever the axe hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

## Charges

The axe has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you take 10 or more lightning damage and then use one of the axe's properties on your next turn, the number of charges required by the property is reduced by 1.

## Spells

While holding the axe, you can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shatter.md\|shatter]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Thunderwave.md\|thunderwave]] (2nd-level version) spell from it (save DC 16).

## Thunderous Performance

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to replace one of your attacks with a special performance. When you do, make a DC 16 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) check. On a success, you create an instantaneous wave of sound, which affects creatures within 10 feet of you; friendly creatures within the wave immediately gain `dice:2d6+2|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 2`) temporary hit points, and hostile creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6+2|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 2`) thunder damage. When you roll a 20 on the Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) check, the radius of your wave increases to 30 feet, and the number of temporary hit points gained and thunder damage dealt is doubled. A creature is immune to these effects if it can't hear the performance. The wave then fades.
