This magic weapon is forged using iron from the stars. While you're attuned to this weapon, you can call upon its latent stellar energy to catalyze change within the metal and create endothermic and exothermic reactions. The weapon can be fused into a greataxe or fissioned into two separated [[5. Mechanics/Items/Battleaxe.md\|battleaxes]]. The weapon has the following properties based on its current state:

## Fused State

While wielding the fused greataxe, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you hold this axe, flames erupt from its edges and a small star burns in its center. These flames shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is sunlight. The greataxe deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage to any target it hits.

## Fissioned State

While wielding the two fissioned battleaxes, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with them. The weapons are bitter cold to the touch and deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage to any target they hit. The axes orbit you slowly while they aren't being held or stowed. You can retrieve a floating battleaxe as if it were sheathed. In addition, when you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with an orbiting battleaxe against a creature you can see within 20 feet of you.

## State Change

This weapon can change between its two states using the following properties:

### Fission

While holding the fused greataxe, you can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word to split it apart into its fissioned state. When you do, electrical energy is released, forcing creatures within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much lightning damage on a successful one. This property can't be used again for 12 hours.

### Fusion

While holding both battleaxes, you can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's other command word to recombine the two battleaxes into its fused state. When you do, the sudden generation of heat creates a wave of fire around you, forcing creatures within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This property can't be used again for 12 hours.
