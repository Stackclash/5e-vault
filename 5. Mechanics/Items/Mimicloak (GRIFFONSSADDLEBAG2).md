# Mimicloak
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mimicloak.webp#right)  


This strange cloak is made using the enchanted remains of a young mimic. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the cloak. The garment's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the cloak can't be anything but a cloak with these properties.

While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on ability checks made to escape from a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]]. Whenever you make an ability check to escape a grapple or free yourself from restraints, the creature or object holding you takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) piercing damage as the cloak's fabric magically splits into a toothed maw to bite it.
