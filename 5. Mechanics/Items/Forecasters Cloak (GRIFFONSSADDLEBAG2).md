# Forecaster's Cloak
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Forecasters-Cloak.webp#right)  


This warm, fur-lined cloak creates illusory representations of the impending weather. While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to open it and speak its command word to create a harmless, sensory effect within the cloak that represents what the weather will be at your location for the next 8 hours. This effect persists for 1 minute or until you close the cloak.
