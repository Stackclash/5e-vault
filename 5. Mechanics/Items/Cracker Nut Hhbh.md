# Cracker Nut
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

The nuts of the *gunneria quercus* are loaded with an expanding gas that causes them to explode upon impact with the ground, allowing them to propagate across the forest floor. During particularly strong winds, the sounds of these nuts hitting the ground create a cacophony of noise reminiscent of cannon fire.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) charges, corresponding to the amount of nuts harvested. As an action, you may expend a charge to throw a nut at a point you can see within 30 feet of you, causing it to burst upon impact and creating a loud cracking sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away.
