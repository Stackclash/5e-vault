# Shielding Turtle Sugarbombs
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shielding-Turtle-Sugarbombs.webp#right)  


These sticky chocolate candies are filled with an enchanted molasses and caramel center and come in packs of 2. You can eat one of these sugarbombs as an action. When you do, your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. If you are proficient with shields and are wearing one on your back, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC while your speed is reduced in this way. If you're wielding a shield, you don't gain this bonus to your AC.

## Upset Stomach

You can only be under the effects of 1 sugarbomb that has this feature at a time. Eating a sugarbomb that has this feature while under the effects of another one causes the effects of the first sugarbomb to immediately end and be replaced by the new one's. This rapid change is difficult to stomach, forcing you to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain the effects of the new sugarbomb, but become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. On a success, you gain the effects of the new sugarbomb and are not poisoned.
