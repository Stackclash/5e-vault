# Everlasting Sugarbomb
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Everlasting-Sugarbomb.webp#right)  


This large sugarbomb is roughly two inches in diameter. Its flavors are a mix of bitter, salty, savory, spicy, sour, and sweet, but also refreshes you as it's slowly eaten. The sugarbomb is solid and slowly dissolves in your mouth, changing in flavor each time you reach a new layer. An everlasting sugarbomb provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for 1 day after 1 minute of letting it dissolve in your mouth. The sugarbomb fully dissolves after 30 uses. You can bite through to the center of the everlasting sugarbomb following a successful DC 25 Strength or Constitution check (your choice). If you succeed, make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you're [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute and suffer from painful nausea.
