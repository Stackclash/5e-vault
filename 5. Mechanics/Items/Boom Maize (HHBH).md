# Boom Maize
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

A variety of corn grown over incredibly fertile soil rich in nitrates and sulphur. Identifiable by the pale grey colouration of their cobs, the kernels themselves contain a large amount of volatile gas that cause a strong, but harmless blast as soon as they break open and are exposed to air. The current theory is that this property allows them to spread their grains without requiring the assistance of animals, but enterprising creatures have repurposed handfuls of these explosive kernels as a makeshift weapon. Also note that under NO circumstance are you to eat these kernels, unless you intend on suffering an incredibly explosive case of gas.

## Effect:

A full pouch of this herb contains 6 charges. As an action, you may expend one or more charges to throw a handful of kernels at a target you can see within 20 feet of you. That target must make a DC 10 Strength saving throw, with the DC increasing by 2 for every charge you expended. On a failure, the target is pushed back 5 feet.
