# Harp of Winter's Tempo
*Instrument, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

You may spend your action to play this harp. If you do so, you may roll any number of your available [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) dice to target an equal number of creatures within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Until the end of the next round, those creatures have a penalty to their initiative score equal to the number you roll on your [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) dice, making separate rolls for each target. If this penalty causes a creature to fall below you in the initiative order, they do not get a new turn and that turn is instead skipped.
