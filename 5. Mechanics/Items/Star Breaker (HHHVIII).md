# Star Breaker
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  


You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. This weapon has 6 charges. While holding this weapon, you may use your bonus action to expend a charge and use either of the following abilities:

- **Collapse Distance.** You target a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be magically teleported, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of you.  
- **Spatial Leap.** You magically teleport yourself, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you.  

This weapon regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
