While wearing these boots, the DC of any ability checks made to track your movements using your footprints increases by 5.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to cause the boots to leave behind no footprints for 1 minute. When you do, another set of similar footprints appear on the ground that lead in random directions. These footprints last for 8 hours and travel up to 300 feet. A successful DC 13 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check reveals that the footprints are magical. Once this property of the boots has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
