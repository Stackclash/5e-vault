# Prisoner's Flail
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Flail.md\|flail]]), uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Prisoners-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This flail is rudimentary in construction, having been made from a sharpened branch and an iron ball and chain. The anguish of untold prisoners has imbued the ball and chain with a miserable semblance of magic. When you hit a humanoid with this weapon, that creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, or 20 feet if the attack scored a critical hit. The reduction lasts until the start of your next turn, during which time this property of the weapon can't be used again. For the duration of the effect, a spectral ball and chain trails behind the affected creature.
