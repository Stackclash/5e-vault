# Stardust Hat
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Stardust-Hat.webp#right)  


This wizard's hat is split into a starburst pattern along the bottom. Small star pendants hang from each of its points. While wearing this hat, you always know which direction is north. At night, you can't become lost by nonmagical means, provided you can see the sky.

In addition, while wearing the hat, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Moonbeam.md\|moonbeam]] spell from the hat, using your spell save DC. Between dusk and dawn, this version of the spell creates a wave of radiant energy when the moonlit beam crashes onto the ground; until the start of your next turn, the cylinder has a radius of 10 feet, instead of 5 feet. Once this property of the hat has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn or dusk.
