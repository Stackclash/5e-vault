# Potion of Sickness
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you become sick with mane disease for `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) hours. While sick in this way, your nose becomes runny and your eyes watery, causing you to have disadvantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight. However, your relatively mild sickness also boosts your immune system, giving you advantage on Constitution saving throws against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] and other diseases. This potion is a pale grey colour with a string of liquid in it that resembles watery mucus.
