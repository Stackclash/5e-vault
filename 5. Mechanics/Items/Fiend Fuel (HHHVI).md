# Fiend Fuel
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This vial is filled with a concentrated extract of a spine devil's blood and is highly flammable. As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns and has disadvantage on any saving throw against an effect that would cause them to suffer fire damage.

A creature can end these effects by using its action to make a DC 11 Dexterity check to remove the oil and flames.
