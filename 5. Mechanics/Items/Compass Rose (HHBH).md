# Compass Rose
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Despite its name, this herb is not actually a rose, nor does it even resemble oneâ€”apparently whoever discovered it just really wanted to make an allusion to the cartography term. This herb, which is actually a type of fern, is magically attuned to the wind which it uses as its main method of propagating spores. It is in fact so sensitive to changes in the wind, that it will react to even the weakest of breezes. This ability has been taken advantage of by spelunkers as a makeshift method of discovering surface passages even when in the most confusing cave systems.

## Effect:

This leafy herb has `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) charges. As an action, you may hold this herb flat on your palm. If you do so, the herb will lose one charge and release a puff of visible spores that travel along the path of the wind. This ability functions even in a walled space like a building or deep cave so long as there is a single open passage connected to the area you are in that leads to the outside.
