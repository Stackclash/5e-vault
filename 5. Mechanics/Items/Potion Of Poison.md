# Potion of Poison
*Potion, minor, uncommon, poison*  

- **Properties**: Poison
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [[5. Mechanics\Items\Potion Of Healing.md|potion of healing]] or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An [[5. Mechanics\Spells\Identify.md|identify]] spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take `dice: 3d6` (`3d6`) poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[\5. Mechanics\Rules\Conditions.md#poisoned|poisoned]]. At the start of each of your turns while you are [[\5. Mechanics\Rules\Conditions.md#poisoned|poisoned]] in this way, you take `dice: 3d6` (`3d6`) poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by `dice: 1d6` (`1d6`). The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
