# Potion of Poison
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing.md\|potion of healing]] or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]]. At the start of each of your turns while you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, you take `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`). The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
