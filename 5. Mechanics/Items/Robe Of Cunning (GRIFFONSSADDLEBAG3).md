# Robe of Cunning
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Robe-of-Cunning.webp#right)  


This silken robe is designed in the likeness of a fox. While wearing it, you have advantage on any Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) check you make.

The robe has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn; a number of ribbon-like fox tails hang from the back, which represent the number of charges the robe has remaining. While wearing the robe, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mislead.md\|mislead]] spell from it. This version of the spell has a duration of 1 minute, and when the spell ends, you can also change your appearance as if you were affected by disguise self (spell save DC 16). The illusory appearance ends after 10 minutes, if you use a bonus action to end the effect early, or if you're reduced to 0 hit points.

Alternatively, when you're reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to expend all of the robe's charges to drop to 1 hit point instead, provided that the robe has at least 1 charge. When you do, you simultaneously cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mislead.md\|mislead]] spell, leaving an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] illusory body in your place.

When you expend the last charge from the robe, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the maximum number of charges the robe has is permanently reduced by 1.
