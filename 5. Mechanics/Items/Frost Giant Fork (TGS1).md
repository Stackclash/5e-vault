This massive utensil comes from the table of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Frost Giant.md\|frost giant]]. Latent jotun magic flows through this makeshift trident and drives your hunger to nearly aggressive levels. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the trident, you can immediately make a bite attack against that same creature as a bonus action. Your jaws and teeth are fortified to have the strength of a giant, allowing this bite attack to deal `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage. You are proficient with this bite attack and use Strength as your ability modifier for it.

## Curse

While you're attuned to this weapon, your hunger is almost insatiable. You're overwhelmingly compelled to eat twice the amount of food you normally would, and incur 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] if you go a day without eating enough.
