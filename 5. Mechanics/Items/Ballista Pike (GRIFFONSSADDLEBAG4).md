This sturdy, adamantine pike was once a ballista bolt. If the pike hits an object or structure, the hit is a critical hit.

When you make an attack with the pike you can speak its command word to throw it, using a normal range of 120 feet and a long range of 480 feet. When you do, the pike hurtles through the air toward the target, as if it were launched from a ballista. On a hit, the target takes an extra `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) piercing damage, in addition to the pike's normal damage.

Once this property of the pike has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
