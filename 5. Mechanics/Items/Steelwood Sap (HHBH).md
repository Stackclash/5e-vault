# Steelwood Sap
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

The mighty steelwood sequoia are some of the oldest trees in the worldâ€”and for good reason. Their bark is virtually impenetrable and as hard as the alloy of its namesake. It owes this property to its incredible sap which drips down across its trunk over the tree's lifetime, and hardens into an invincible, yet flexible, veneer. If you manage to find an open vein of fresh sap, be sure to collect some as the protective coating it provides can make you as strong and long-lived as this majestic tree.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you are covered in a protective coating of magical sap, granting you the following benefits:

- You have a natural armour that grants you 18 AC if it was lower than that before.  
- You cannot take more than one quarter of your maximum hit points in damage in any single instance of damage; any damage taken above that amount is negated.  
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.
