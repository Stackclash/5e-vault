# Dryad's Key
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Dryads-Key.webp#right)  


This lush, green leaf has a bug-bitten, key-like tooth at the bottom of its stem. While holding the leaf, you can use an action to speak its command word and place it into or against a Large or larger tree, turning it like a key and casting the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Transport Via Plants.md\|transport via plants]] spell from it, using the tree as the entrance for the spell. Once the leaf has been used in this way, it withers and becomes a nonmagical leaf.
