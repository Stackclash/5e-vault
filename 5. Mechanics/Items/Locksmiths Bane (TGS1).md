# Locksmith's Bane
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Locksmiths-Bane.webp#right)  


This silver lockpick twists and reorients itself to more easily open locks. You gain a +3 bonus on ability checks you make with this tool in order to pick open a lock. If you roll a 1 on an ability check in this way, the pick casts the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Knock.md\|knock]] spell on the lock before it turns to dust and is destroyed.

If you roll a 1 in this way and use an ability to reroll the die or otherwise change the result, the item becomes a nonmagical, mundane lock pick but does not cast the spell or disintegrate.
