# Phoenix Breastplate
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Breastplate.md\|breastplate]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Phoenix-Breastplate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

This golden breastplate has the shape of a phoenix worked into its design. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.

When you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do, a fiery explosion surrounds you. Hostile creatures within 30 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You and other friendly creatures within the area regain a number of hit points equal to the same amount, instead of taking fire damage. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) days have passed.
