# Timber
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Handaxe.md\|handaxe]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Timber.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 S
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magical axe is imbued with a destructive force that builds with each consecutive strike. You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon equal to the number of charges it currently has. The handaxe gains 1 charge each time you make a successful attack with it: up to a maximum of 3 charges. When timber gains its third charge, the built-up force explodes; it loses all charges, and the target takes an extra `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) force damage, or `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) if it's made of wood. When this happens, if the target is no more than one size larger than you, you can choose to push it up to 10 feet away from you.

Timber's charges last for up to 1 minute. It loses all charges if you make an attack against a new target, make an attack with a different weapon, or miss with an attack using timber.
