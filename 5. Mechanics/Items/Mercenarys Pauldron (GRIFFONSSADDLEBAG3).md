# Mercenary's Pauldron
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mercenarys-Pauldron.webp#right)  


This magic pauldron has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can use a bonus action while wearing the pauldron to expend 1 of its charges to divine its tactical insights, magically granting you advantage on the next weapon attack roll you make before the end of your next turn. On a hit, the attack deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage of the weapon's type, and you gain that same amount of temporary hit points, which last until the end of your next turn.
