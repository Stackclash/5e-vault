# Potion of Spell Recovery
*Potion, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Potion-of-Spell-Recovery.webp#right)  


When you drink this potion, you recover expended spells slots with a combined level that is equal to or less than `dice:1d3+3|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 3`), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
