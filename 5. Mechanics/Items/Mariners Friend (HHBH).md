# Mariner's Friend
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

While this low lying shrub may seem like a common weed to the less educated, this herb is actually considered one of the most useful in the world, and certainly a cornerstone to any coastal civilisation. This is due to the hydrophobic oil that the plant secretes that is capable of completely waterproofing any material, allowing it to be submerged in water, yet emerge bone dry.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, any liquid that touches you instantly drains off your body, clothes, and possessions, leaving you completely dry.
