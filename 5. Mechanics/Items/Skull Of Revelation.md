# Skull of Revelation
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This skull has a small black candle embedded in its crown. While this candle is lit, the skull activates and sheds a bright light in a 15-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 15 feet. If you make an Intelligence based check to evaluate anything contained within the bright light, you make that check with advantage.

The candle has a duration of 1 hour. Once this duration has expired, the candle must be replaced with another candle that costs 50 gp.
