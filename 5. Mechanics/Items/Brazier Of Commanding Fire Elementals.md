# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/brazier-of-commanding-fire-elementals.jpg#right]]  

- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Fire Elemental.md\|fire elemental]], as if you had cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Elemental.md\|conjure elemental]] spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
