# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a [[/5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Fire Elemental.md|fire elemental]], as if you had cast the [[/5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Elemental.md|conjure elemental]] spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
