# Corruption Skull
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While holding this skull, you may use it to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Message.md\|message]] spell without using any components.

Once per day, when you cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Message.md\|message]] in this way, you may also choose to force your target to succeed a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for the next 24 hours. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, their alignment changes to evil, and any [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]] (Charisma) checks you make to convince them to perform an evil act is rolled at advantage. The charm ends after 24 hours, or if you do anything to directly harm the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature.
