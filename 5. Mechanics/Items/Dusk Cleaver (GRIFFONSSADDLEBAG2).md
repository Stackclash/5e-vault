This dark iron axe head is shaped like a crescent moon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to swing the axe at an area of magical darkness within 5 feet of you, making an attack roll against the darkness (AC 10). If the magical darkness was created by a spell, add the spell's level to its AC. If you're inside the area of magical darkness, you ignore the disadvantage normally imposed on this attack roll as a result of not being able to see. On a hit, the darkness is dispelled. If the darkness fills a space that's larger than 60 feet on a side, the darkness in a 60-foot cube originating from you is dispelled instead. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
