This mithral whip was once used by a powerful monster hunter. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, targets hit by the whip take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) slashing damage from its attacks.

The whip has 7 runes on its handle that correspond to different damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, radiant, or thunder. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this weapon, you can channel 1 or more of the runes to deal an extra `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) damage of the type or types that correspond to the channeled runes. For example, you can channel 2 runes to add `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) acid and `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) fire damage to an attack against a troll, or 1 rune to add `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) thunder damage to an attack against a clay golem. Once you add a damage type to an attack in this way, you can't add that type again until the following dawn.
