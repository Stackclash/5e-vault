# Ironleaf Thicket
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A thick and hardy bush with leaves that display a distinctive metallic lustre. While most local legends around this plant would claim that the plant is touched by some sort of crafting or forging god that turned its leaves to metal, the truth is quite different, but (in my opinion) no less wondrous. What looks like a coating of iron is actually a symbiotic mould that grows only on this bush. This mould has an incredibly dense structure that protects the bush from sharp mountain winds and loose rocks that would threaten itâ€”and in exchange, the mould feeds on the plant and uses it for photosynthesis. While it would be a shame to separate these partnered species, it is possible to gain the mould's protection by rubbing it on oneself and transferring the mould to one's skin. Of course, without the leaf, the mould will soon die, but even temporary protection by this plant should be considered a blessing.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you have a +2 bonus to AC, as well as a shiny metallic grey colouration to your skin.
