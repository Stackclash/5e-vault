# Clockwork Healerbee
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Clockwork-Healerbee.webp#right)  


This pill-shaped magical mechanism is 2 inches long and made of brass and glass. It has a pair of tiny wings that silently keep it aloft. It hovers up to 5 feet above the ground and does its best to stay at your side within your space. The bee can enter and pass through another creature's space and does not provoke opportunity attacks.

The bee has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While the bee is within your space, you can speak its command word as a bonus action and expend up to 3 of its charges to command the bee to heal a creature that you can see within 20 feet of you. The bee flies to the creature's space and touches its stinger to the creature, causing the creature to regain `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) hit points for each expended charge and emitting a bright light that fills the space. After healing the creature, the bee returns to your space.

The bee is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has AC 15, 10 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. If the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mending.md\|mending]] spell is cast on the bee while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) hit points. If the bee drops to 0 hit points, it can't be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.
