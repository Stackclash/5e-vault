# Prepyrus
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A reedy plant long favoured by swamp-dwelling people for its papery stalks that make wonderful stationary. In fact, the plant itself contains magical properties that aid in concentration and have been used by mages in order to refresh their magical arsenals when under pressure.

## Effect:

During a short rest, you may write down a series of magical incantations on this herb to change your list of prepared spells. You still need to spend the same amount of time to prepare each spell as listed in your class feature, however. This herb may only be used once.
