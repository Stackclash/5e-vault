# Haunted Figure
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This figure resembles an infant child of a humanoid race of your choice. Due to the tamed dybbuk spirit possessing it, this figure is incredibly lifelike and seems like a real child to anyone but the most discerning observers.

When first created, this figure is deactivated and only awakens once a chosen command word is spoken within 10 feet of it. This figure is then loyal to whomever spoke the command word and follows its verbal commands; however, it often fulfills vague orders in mischievous ways. If it has fulfilled all of its duties, the haunted figure attempts to entertain itself through a variety of (often dangerous) pranks.

This figure remains active until its command word is spoken again or if it the creature that spoke its command word moves more than 1 mile away from it or is on a different plane of existence. If this figure is reduced to 0 hit points, it is broken beyond repair and the animating spirit within dissipates.

Use the following statblock for your haunted figure when it is animated:
