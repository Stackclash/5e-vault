# Blue Vanguard's Glory
*Major, very rare (requires attunement by a creature with a constitution score of 17 or higher)*

This brilliant deep blue armor is the bulwark for the king's royal front rank. While you have more than half your Hit Dice remaining, you can spend 1 of them as a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

This armor has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d4+3|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 3`) expended charges daily at dawn.

## "At You!"

If you move at least 10 feet straight toward a target while wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to expend up to 5 of its charges to move up to 10 more feet toward the target. If you hit the target with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, it must also succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. For each charge you spend in this way beyond the first, you can move an additional 5 feet toward the target, and on a hit, the save DC is increased by 1.

## "Back, Cur!"

When you hit a Large or smaller target with a melee weapon attack while wearing this armor, you can choose to expend up to 5 of its charges to push the creature 10 feet away from you. For each charge you spend in this way beyond the first, the target is pushed an additional 5 feet away from you. If the pushed target is stopped by a solid surface, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet of movement it had left to move before it was stopped. If the target is pushed into another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage.

## "Nowhere to Run!"

As an action while wearing this armor, you can expend up to 5 of its charges to compel a creature into a duel. One creature within 30 feet of you that can hear and see you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically compelled by your command. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until you attack any other creature. For the duration, the compelled creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and if it attempts to move away from you, it must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. The creature can use an action to try to rid itself of your magical influence. When it does, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on the target. For each charge you spend in this way beyond the first, the save DC is increased by 1.

## Flaw

The Blue Vanguard's glory compels its wearer to be aggressive and overprotective. While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: "I will not tolerate violence towards my friends. I will separate the problem from them with myself." In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your principal charge and you are quick to separate them from acts of aggression, taking on the ire in their stead. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you're already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your principal charge, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell, but not while you are attuned to the armor.
