# Potion of Reflexes
*Potion, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you gain one reaction on every turn in a combat. This effect lasts for 1 minute, after which you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. This potion is completely clear except for one cloudy grey portion that darts around in the liquid towards anything holding the bottle.
