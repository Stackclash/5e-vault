This blade was once used as a dagger by an ogre, but is nevertheless large enough to be a shortsword. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This blade's hilt is hollow and can hold up to 3 cantrip spell scrolls. Cantrip scrolls left within the compartment for 1 minute activate one of the three clear gems adorning its grip. Once activated, you can cast these cantrips at will using your spellcasting modifier. If you don't have a spellcasting modifier, use your Intelligence modifier instead. You have proficiency with these cantrips. Cantrips cast from the blade use the weapon as an arcane focus and allow you to perform any somatic components with the weapon instead of requiring a free hand. Scrolls contained within the sword are not destroyed after using them in this way.

When you cast a cantrip using the sword that deals damage, the sword's damage type changes to match the cantrip's for 1 minute or until you end it early (no action required).

> [!note] Cantrips from Magic Items
> 
> Remember, spells cast from magic items are always cast at their lowest possible level unless otherwise specified. That includes cantrips! Regardless of your character level, cantrips cast from magic items are always cast as if you're 1st level.
