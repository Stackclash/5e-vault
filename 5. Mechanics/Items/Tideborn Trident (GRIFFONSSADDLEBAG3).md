This regal trident has been fought over by merfolk and sahuagin for centuries. Its shaft is made of crystalline glass and filled with a never-ending fount of water. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you're attuned to it, you have a swimming speed of 40 feet and can breathe underwater. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with merfolk and sahuagin.

## Endless Water

The trident functions as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Decanter Of Endless Water.md\|decanter of endless water]]. The water it produces magically pours from one of its tines.

## Pod Tactics

You have advantage on any target you attack with the trident that's also within 5 feet of another friendly creature. While underwater, you can move up to 10 feet immediately before or after making a melee attack with the trident, provided that your speed isn't 0. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

## Returning

Whenever you make a ranged attack with the trident, it flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.

## Tidal Burst

While holding the trident, you can use an action to cause an orb of frigid water to amass at its top. The water remains there for as long as you concentrate on it (as if [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentrating]] on a spell), up to 1 minute. You can amass more water to the top of the trident in this way for the duration using a bonus action on your subsequent turns, up to a combined total of three times. Any target hit with the trident while it's amassed water in this way takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) cold damage from the attack for each time that it's amassed water. You can use a bonus action to magically launch the orb of water at a target that you can see within 60 feet of you, using a spell attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes `dice:4d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d4`) cold damage for each time you amassed water to it. Any other creature within 5 feet of the target must also succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take half as much cold damage. The effect then ends. If the target is underwater, you have advantage on the spell attack roll.
