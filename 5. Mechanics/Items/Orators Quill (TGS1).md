# Orator's Quill
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Orators-Quill.webp#right)  


This red feather quill generates its own mundane ink and acts on its own as you speak to it. While holding the quill, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to activate it. While activated, the quill magically floats upright and writes the words you speak to it on whatever stationary, nonliving surface it's been placed on. When it reaches the edge of that surface, it begins a new line below before continuing. If the quill reaches the end of the surface, such as a piece of parchment, it taps against the surface expectantly until a new one is provided. You must be within 15 feet of the quill in order to speak to it. If the quill is behind total cover, it cannot understand you. If you speak the quill's command word again, even if you're not holding it, the quill deactivates and falls down. If the quill doesn't write anything for 1 minute, it deactivates on its own.
