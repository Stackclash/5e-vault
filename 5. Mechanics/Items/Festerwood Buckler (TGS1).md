# Festerwood Buckler
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Festerwood-Buckler.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This festerwood shield is riddled with amber pustules that glow with a low, yellow light. While holding this magic shield, the pustules emit bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for another 5 feet. In addition, while you're holding the shield, you can use your reaction when a creature that you can see within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack to bash that creature with the shield. When you do, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) acid damage.
