# Jingle Berries
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Little yellow berries that resemble the chimes of a bell, found on arctic shrubs. While they are edible (and actually considered quite flavourful), the seeds within actually burst once exposed to digestive acid. While this is harmless, the seeds release small but surprisingly audible shards that create a jingle noise whenever they are jostledâ€”such as by the movement of the creature that ate them.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) charges. As an action, you may expend a charge to eat one of these berries. For the next 10 minutes, you produce a jingling sound whenever you take a step.

> I once had the surreal experience of eating a handful of these fruits for my afternoon tea, mere moments before I was ambushed by a lurking remorhaz. While naturally I managed to fend it off, the valiance of the effort was very much reduced by the incongruous jingling sound I made while diving out of danger (for more on this story, and other musical anecdotes, pickup a copy of 'Hamund's Heartwarming Harmonies, volIII').
