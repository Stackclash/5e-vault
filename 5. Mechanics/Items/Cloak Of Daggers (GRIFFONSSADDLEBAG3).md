# Cloak of Daggers
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Cloak-of-Daggers.webp#right)  


This asymmetrical cloak has a ring of silver daggers along its bottom hem. While wearing the cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks while in dim light or darkness.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to summon a magic silver dagger to one or both of your hands, provided that they're empty. Each dagger disappears in a puff of smoke after 1 minute or at the end of your turn if you aren't holding it.
