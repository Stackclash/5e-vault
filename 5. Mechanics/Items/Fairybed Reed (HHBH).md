# Fairybed Reed
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

A wonderfully beautiful reed that grows a distinctive pad on top covered with incredibly soft, cotton-like seeds. These pads led native cultures to believe that they were used as resting places by fey folk that were passing through, and that by dwelling there, they in turn imbued the plant with their infamous talents for hiding and stealth. Indeed, the soft seeds of the pad and the oil of the stalk have been used by experienced soldiers to dampen the sound of their equipment when on raids or scouting expeditions.

## Effect:

You may spend 10 minutes applying this herb to yourself, stuffing its seeds into your armour and lubricating the joints with its oil. If you do so, you ignore any disadvantage to Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks that you may have while wearing your armor type.
