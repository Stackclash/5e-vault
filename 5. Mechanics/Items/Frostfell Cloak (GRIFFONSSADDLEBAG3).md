# Frostfell Cloak
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Frostfell-Cloak.webp#right)  


This cloak has an icy, geometric pattern of a snowflake inside its warm lining. While wearing the cloak, you have resistance to cold damage and ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. As you walk, snowflakes drift behind you and vanish upon touching the ground.

The cloak has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Once on each of your turns while wearing the cloak, you can expend 1, 2, or 3 charges from the cloak (no action required) by forfeiting 10, 20, or 30 feet of your walking speed for that turn, respectively, in order to spin in place instead. If your maximum walking speed is 25 feet, you can choose to forfeit 25 feet instead of 30. As you spin in place, a wave of bitter cold spreads out from the cloak, causing the ground in a 5-foot radius around you to become covered in thick snow. The radius increases by 5 feet for each additional charge you expend, up to 15 feet. Each other creature within the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) cold damage.

The snow is difficult terrain and remains for `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) rounds, disappearing at the start of your turn on the round that it would end.
