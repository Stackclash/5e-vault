The typical [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shifters Shine (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|shifter's shine]], a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes your face to appear more glamorous. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, your skin's complexion clears, appears healthier, and grows more taut. Your face, while largely unchanged, is distinctly more attractive and exudes a weak aura of enchantment magic. When you make a Charisma check while under the effects of this potion, you can choose to forgo rolling the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) to get a 10 on the die. Once you use this property, you can't use it again for the remainder of the potion's duration. The potion is a rich honey color and swirls lazily around, regardless of how it's handled. It can be found in any sort of vessel, though it is usually found in glass jars. The eye of a shapeshifter drifts along the potion's bottom, making it a daunting beverage for the average taverngoer to order. It has an extremely strong alcoholic taste with a hint of caramel. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.

The following [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shifters Shine (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|shifter's shine]] is an uncommon variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Alter Self.md\|alter self]] spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action.
