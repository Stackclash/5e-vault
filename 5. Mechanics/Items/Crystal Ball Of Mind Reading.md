This [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]] is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] spell (save DC 17) with it.

You can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]] spell (save DC 17) while you are [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]], targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]] to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] ends.
