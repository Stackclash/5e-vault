# Snakeskin Root
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A root that resembles the shed skin of a desert viper found buried under the desert sands. While the taste is unpleasant, it has a rather terrifying, but ultimately harmless side effect of rapidly increasing the regeneration rate of one's skin. In practice, this causes the consumer to shed their own skin in tiny sand-like grains. While this certainly looks worrisome, the result is actually like a rejuvenating spa treatment that removes dead skin and in fact recently, nobles have taken to a trend of buying these roots in large amounts to add to their foppish beauty regimes.

## Effect:

As an action, you may eat this herb. For the next hour, your skin constantly flakes off, leaving a sand-like trail behind yourself, but you suffer no ill effects. At the end of this hour, your skin becomes extremely smooth as if you had exfoliated your entire body.
