# Kraken Kelp
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

Inky black and with distinctive bulbs along its length that resembles foreboding suckers, these long strands of kelp rise from sea beds looking like the tentacles of its namesake. It is said that they are created when the kraken's infamous inky spray mixes with regular kelp, mutating it into this new form. Coastal societies venerate this kelp as a boon from the powerful creature, using the magical bulbs to hide their warriors during raids.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) charges, corresponding to the amount of intact bulbs along its length. As part of using this herb, you must expend 1 charge by popping the bulb and applying its inky miasma to yourself. For an hour after being used, you emit a 10-foot radius cloud of darkness that only you can see through. Anything within the cloud is considered "heavily obscured" to any creature other than you.
