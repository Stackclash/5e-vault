# Ring of Dagger Ice
*Ring, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Ring-of-Dagger-Ice.webp#right)  


This dark silver ring is always cold to the touch. The gemstone set in it is made of dagger ice: a magical ice fragment from the Everglacier. While wearing the ring, you have resistance to cold damage.

## Rays of Frost

While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Frost.md\|ray of frost]] spell from it, using a spell attack bonus of +8. This version of the spell creates four rays, instead of one. Each ray can target the same or different targets. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray; on a hit, the target suffers the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Frost.md\|ray of frost]] spell as normal. If two rays hit the same target, the target's speed is reduced by half, instead of 10 feet (whichever is greater). If all four rays hit the same target, its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.
