# Curse of Never-Ending Fear
*Wondrous item, curse, cursed item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:

## Curse:

> [!quote]  
> 
> While attuned to this item you become cursed. While cursed, any saving throw you make to resist becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] is done so at disadvantage. Furthermore, if you become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of a creature, that [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition continues indefinitely and only ends if that creature dies, that creature willingly ends the effect on you as a free action, or if the creature remains out of your line of sight for 24 hours.
> 
> This curse ends permanently on both the item and you if the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic is cast on either you or the cursed item.
