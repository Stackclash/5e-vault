# Brooch of Many Sizes
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Brooch-of-Many-Sizes.webp#right)  


This metal brooch features a rotatable dial and can be used to secure a cape or adorn a piece of clothing. While wearing the brooch, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|enlarge/reduce]] spell, targeting only yourself, by turning the dial toward either the larger or smaller figure adorning the sides of the brooch. Once this property of the brooch has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

While under the effects of this spell, you can use a bonus action to overload the brooch by forcibly twisting the dial beyond its normal limits. When you do, your size changes by an additional category: growing either a second size larger if you had cast the *enlarge* spell or a second size smaller if you had cast the *reduce* spell. Your size can't be larger than Huge or smaller than Tiny by overloading the brooch, and your damage and weight are increased or decreased as if you were affected by a second instance of the *enlarge/reduce* spell.

When you return to your original size after overloading the brooch, you can't move or take actions until after your next turn. Once the brooch has been overloaded, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
