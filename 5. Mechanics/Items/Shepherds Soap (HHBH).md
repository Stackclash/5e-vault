# Shepherd's Soap
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

An abundant wild-growing weed with a dull, purple flower on its tip. Its main method of propagation is to exude an enticing fragrance that causes animals to approach and attempt to eat it, at which point its flower bursts a cloud of seeds across the fur of the animal, spreading them wherever they then go. Shepherds have long since learned to harvest this weed and rub it on themselves when they bathe to make their scent more calming to the animals they tend to.

## Effect:

After using this herb, you produce a pleasant smell for the next 4 hours that makes any animal around you trust you instinctively. During this time, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Animal%20Handling\|Animal Handling]]) checks made to communicate with any animal within 30 feet of you that can hear and smell you.
