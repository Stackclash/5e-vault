# Umbra Tongue
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

For obvious reasons, it is extraordinarily difficult to find plants in the dark depths of caves. However, there is one plant that not only manages to survive in an environment devoid of sunlight, it actually manages to thrive down there. The umbra tongue is a variety of liverwort identifiable by its clumps of black leaves that litter the ground. Whereas most plants require sunlight for photosynthesis, this herb actually does the opposite and consumes the darkness itself, creating an eerie purple glow on its leaf edges as a side effect. Cave dwellers have long discovered the medicinal use of this plant, as it can be easily applied to the skin like a patch, whereupon it takes root and transfers the energy it pulls from the shadows into vitality for the creature that wears it.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, you gain 6 temporary hit points whenever you start your turn in darkness.
