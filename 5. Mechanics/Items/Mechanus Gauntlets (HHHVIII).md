# Mechanus Gauntlets
*Wondrous item, legendary*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing these gauntlets, you automatically succeed on any contested [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Shove\|Shove]] attack made against a target that is Huge or smaller. If the target is larger than that, you have advantage on your check instead. You also have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls on melee weapon attacks.
