# Berserker Brew
*Potion, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you become instilled with a maddening thirst for violence for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you deal an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) damage to your target whenever you make a successful weapon attack, and you cannot be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]]. However, if you do not cause damage to a target on your turn, you suffer `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage as your rage burns into your own mind. This damage cannot be reduced in any way. This crimson red potion continuously roils and froths as if constantly agitated by an unseen force.
