# Toad Skin Shrub
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A type of oleander easily identified by its yellow petals dappled with dark spots that resemble the skin of a toad. Like other varieties of oleander, this herb is extremely toxic. In fact, this herb is so toxic, that consuming it will cause one's body to immediately attempt to shed the hazardous chemicals from their body through their skin, and thus becoming rather toxic themselves. Some animals actually take advantage of this by leveraging their natural resistances to poisons to imbibe this plant and thus gaining a protective coat of poison themselves.

## Effect:

As an action, you may eat this herb, forcing you to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for one hour. Regardless of the outcome, you also secrete a toxic slime from your skin for the next hour that forces any creature that touches you or who hits you with a melee weapon attack to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].
