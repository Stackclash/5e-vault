# Pact Card
*Wondrous item, minor*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Pact-Card.webp#right)  


Pact cards are used to temporarily bind the souls of aberrations and demons to your will. When you reduce an aberration or demon to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to hold out a pact card on your person. That creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or instantly disappear, regaining all its hit points and becoming trapped inside the card. A creature with legendary actions automatically succeeds on this saving throw. The card's save DC and the maximum challenge rating creature the card can contain depend on its rarity, as shown on the table below:

| Rarity | Save DC | Max CR |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Uncommon | 13 | 2 |
| Rare | 15 | 6 |
| Very rare | 16 | 13 |
| Legendary | 17 | - |

You can use an action to hold out a pact card with a creature trapped inside it. When you do, the trapped aberration or demon appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. It disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the aberration or demon, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

The GM has the creature's statistics. Once the creature is summoned, the card burns away in a harmless blue flame and is destroyed.
