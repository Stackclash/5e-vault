# Pack of Revisibility Bombs
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Pack-of-Revisibility-Bombs.webp#right)  


A pack of revisibility bombs typically includes 1d3 + 3 fist-sized bombs when found. You can use an action to throw a bomb at a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The bomb explodes at the point where it impacts, destroying the bomb and releasing a dispelling vapor in a cloud around it. When the bomb explodes, each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes visible if it isn't already, and can't become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] for 1 minute. Objects within the area that aren't being worn or carried automatically become visible if they're [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] and can't become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] for 1 minute.
