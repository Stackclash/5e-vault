# Cloak of Invisibility
*Wondrous Item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over your head to cause yourself to become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible|invisible]]. While you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible|invisible]], anything you are carrying or wearing is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible|invisible]] with you. You become visible when you cease wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the cloak's maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the cloak goes unused, it regains 1 hour of duration.
