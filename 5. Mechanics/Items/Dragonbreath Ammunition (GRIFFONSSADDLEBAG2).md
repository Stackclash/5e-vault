# Dragonbreath Ammunition
*Minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Dragonbreath-Ammunition.webp#right)  


This metallic ammunition flies effortlessly on its own when fired. When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action and make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead fire this ammunition at a point you can see within range. The arrow or bolt explodes when it reaches the point, destroying the ammunition and creating either a cone or 5-foot-wide line of dragon's breath in the direction it was fired. The created effect depends on the metal it was cast from. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) damage of the associated type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Use the table below to determine the effect's area of effect and damage type:

| Ammunition Metal | Area | Damage Type |
|------------------|------|-------------|
| Brass | 60-foot line | Fire |
| Bronze | 90-foot line | Lightning |
| Copper | 60-foot line | Acid |
| Gold | 60-foot cone | Fire |
| Silver | 60-foot cone | Cold |
