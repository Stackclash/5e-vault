# Oozo (Uncommon)
*Potion, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Oozo.webp#right)  


The typical oozo, an uncommon potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes you to become slightly gelatinous and translucent. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, creatures that make a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check to search for you while you're hiding must roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from the check. If you haven't moved since the start of your last turn, they must roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) instead. The drink is gelatinous and is more accurately slurped than drunk. Despite its questionable texture, it tastes light and refreshing, with a hint of licorice and orange. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
