As an action, you may speak this weapon's command word to activate its ability for the next minute. While this dagger's ability is active, any damage it deals to a creature that is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you does not count as damaging it or doing anything harmful to it for the sake of potentially ending the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charm effect]]. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
