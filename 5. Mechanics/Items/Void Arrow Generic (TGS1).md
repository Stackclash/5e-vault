# Void Arrow (Generic)
*Minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Void-Arrow.webp#right)  


This pitch-dark piece of ammunition is composed of densely-packed shadows. A creature hit by this magic ammunition takes psychic damage instead of piercing damage. This ammunition makes no sound when it's fired or strikes a surface, leaves no discernible wounds, and vanishes immediately after hitting a creature.
