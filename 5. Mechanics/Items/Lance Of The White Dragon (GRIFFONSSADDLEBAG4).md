# Lance of the White Dragon
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance.md\|lance]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Lance-of-the-White-Dragon.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 piercing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Special%20Weapons\|special]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This magic lance is covered in spines and white dragon fragments. The air around it is always frigid.

## Charges

This weapon has 5 charges for the following properties; it regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If the lance has at least 1 charge, it deals an extra `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) cold damage to any target it hits.

You can use one of the following properties on each of your turns while holding the lance.

## Biting Cold

When you hit a creature with the lance, you can expend 2 of its charges to force that creature to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by ice. The ice remains until the start of your next turn or until the creature takes bludgeoning or fire damage. If it takes bludgeoning damage in this way, that damage is increased by `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`).

## Frigid Wrath

When you roll cold damage, you can expend 2 of the lance's charges to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling. If the cold damage is from the lance, it costs 1 charge to use this property instead.

## Icy Launch

While on the ground, you can expend 1 of the lance's charges using a bonus action to create a spire of ice beneath you. The spire launches you up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice, without provoking opportunity attacks. The ice crumbles and disappears immediately after. When the spire appears, each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed up to 5 feet away from the spire.
