# Circlet of the Huntsman's Third Eye
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Circlet-of-the-Huntsmans-Third-Eye.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This barbed metal circlet features a grotesque yet ornately preserved eye hanging from its center. The eye rests on the forehead of the creature wearing it. While wearing the circlet, its latent cunning guides your hand, giving you advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks.

The circlet has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the circlet, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hunters Mark.md\|hunter's mark]] spell from it. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on this spell. In addition, you can expend a 2nd charge when casting *hunter's mark* in this way, or 1 charge as a bonus action on another turn, to gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Truesight\|truesight]] out to a range of 120 feet for 1 minute.

## Curse

Attuning to the circlet curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the circlet fails to end the curse. While cursed, whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll or ability check, you take `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) psychic damage as the eye's intense frustration and scorn pierce your psyche.
