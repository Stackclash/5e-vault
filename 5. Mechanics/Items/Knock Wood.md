# Knock Wood
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

When a fey creature makes their home inside a tree, occasionally they may pass along some of their unpredictable and capricious nature into the wood itself which can be unlocked with a simple knock. This is referred to as a piece of knock wood, an enchanted chunk of tree identifiable by a faint humming that canbe heard from it at all times. When its power is literally tapped into, it can allow the holder to defy fate in small, but sometimes crucial ways.

## Effect:

While holding this herb in your hand, if you are forced to make a roll at disadvantage, you may use your reaction to knock this herb against something hard. If you do so, you make your roll as normal instead of at disadvantage. Once this herb has been used once, it loses all power and becomes useless.
