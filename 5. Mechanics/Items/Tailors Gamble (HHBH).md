# Tailor's Gamble
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

While most berries of the chromat oak area dull black colour (and unbearably tart at that), when grown under optimal conditions, they may occasionally produce a single berry that shines in every colour of the rainbow. This berry is highly prized as its juice is a potent dye ingredientâ€”capable of colouring an entire article of clothing despite being only the size of a grape. Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine exactly which colour this prismatic fruit will impart until after the dye has set into the fabric, but some people enjoy the random chance and consider it to be a minor spectacle.

## Effect:

As part of preparing this herb, you must soak an article of clothing, a creature's hair, or a length of fabric no larger than 3 square feet in area, into a solution of water and this herb. Once the herb has been applied, the soaked item is permanently dyed a certain colour randomly determined by the table below.
