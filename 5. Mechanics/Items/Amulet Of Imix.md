# Amulet of Imix
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain 5 temporary hit points whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points. In addition, any time you are forced to roll a Constitution saving throw to maintain control of a fire elemental or maintain concentration on a spell that deals fire damage, you do so at advantage.
