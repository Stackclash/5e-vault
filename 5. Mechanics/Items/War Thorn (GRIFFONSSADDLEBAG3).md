# War Thorn
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/War Pick.md\|war pick]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/War-Thorn.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

A large thorn grows from this magic war pick's wooden haft to form the head of the weapon. When you use this weapon to hit a creature with an opportunity attack as the result of that creature's movement, that creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of the turn.

If you are a druid and can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shillelagh.md\|shillelagh]] spell, you can also cast that spell on this weapon. For the duration of the spell, you are considered to be proficient with this weapon.
