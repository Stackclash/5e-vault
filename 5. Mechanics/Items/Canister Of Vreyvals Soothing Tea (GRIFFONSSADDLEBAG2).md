# Canister of Vreyval's Soothing Tea
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Canister-of-Vreyvals-Soothing-Tea.webp#right)  


This small metal canister contains `dice:2d4+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4 + 2`) bags of magical tea when found. You can steep a bag of tea for 1 minute in a cup of boiling water to transform the water into a rich, flavorful tea that calms the nerves and revitalizes the spirit. When you drink a cup of the hot tea, you regain `dice:1d6+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) hit points and gain the same amount as temporary hit points. In addition, any effect causing you to be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] is suppressed for 1 hour, after which any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration hasn't expired in the meantime.

You can drink the tea using an action, although it's most commonly finished over the course of at least 1 minute. If the tea has been left to cool before you drink it, you regain only half the amount of hit points and temporary hit points, and no other effects are suppressed.
