# Gut Rot
*Potion, common, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with the disease [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#gut%20rot\|gut rot]]. While afflicted with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#gut%20rot\|gut rot]], any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer `dice: 4|avg` (`4`) necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#gut%20rot\|gut rot]], a violet fungus sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) days.
