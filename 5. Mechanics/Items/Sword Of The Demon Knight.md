# Sword of the Demon Knight
*Melee Weapon, very rare (requires attunement by an evil creature)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/sword-demon-knight.jpg#right]]  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: Martial, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

If you are a neutral character, this jagged longsword functions as a normal weapon with no bonus or special properties. If you are good, touching Sir Malcoda's blade deals `dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage to you. If you are an evil character, you can use the sword of the demon knight as a magic weapon with the following properties.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Wielding this weapon with two hands causes it to glow with red light, shedding bright light for 20 feet and dim light for an extra 20 feet. Once per day, the wielder can cause the sword to flash a baleful, blinding red light. Lawful good creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] for 1 round.

Whenever you score a critical hit, roll a `dice: d6|avg` (`d6`) on the Demons row of the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Servitors.md\|Servitors]] chart (page 31). Demonic runes appear on the ground and the rolled servitor appears from the shadows. This servitor fights for you and obeys your commands. They return to the Abyss after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points. The demonic eye on the sword's cross-guard focuses intently on any lawful good creature within 30 feet.
