# Candle of Anti-Light
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Candle-of-Anti-Light.webp#right)  


While burning, this dark candle sheds magical darkness in a 10-foot radius. It can be lit for up to 1 hour before it's consumed and can be snuffed or relit like a normal candle. Completely covering the candle with something opaque contains the darkness. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.
