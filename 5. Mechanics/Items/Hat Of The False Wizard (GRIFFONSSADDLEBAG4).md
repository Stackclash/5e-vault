# Hat of the False Wizard
*Wondrous item, cursed item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Hat-of-the-False-Wizard.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Druidcraft.md\|druidcraft]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Thaumaturgy.md\|thaumaturgy]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Prestidigitation.md\|prestidigitation]] spell from it.

## Curse

This curse is only revealed and extended to you when you cast a spell that isn't a cantrip and are wearing the hat. As long as you're cursed, you can't remove the hat unless you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While you're cursed, you must first succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw whenever you cast a spell that isn't a cantrip. On a failed save, the spell fails, and the action is wasted.

Alternatively, once you have succeeded on at least 10 cumulative Intelligence checks or saving throws while wearing the hat, you can choose to forcibly end the curse on yourself after succeeding on an Intelligence check or save. The hat is then reduced to tatters and destroyed.
