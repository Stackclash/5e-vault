# Glowmoss
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A simple and ubiquitous moss, immediately recognisable for the faint blue glow it emits at all times due to a symbiotic bacteria that lives inside it. While this light is fairly unimpressive by itself, once piled together in large quantities, they can provide a decent (and quite haunting) level of illumination.

## Effect:

This herb sheds dim light in a 5 foot radius around it.
