# Oil of the Memory Thief
*Oil, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

As an action, you can coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon with this oil. For the next 10 minutes, any creature struck by this weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/He(AL).md\|heal]] spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. While memory drained, a creature must roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) becomes a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`), the `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) becomes a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`), and so on until the die becomes a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`), at which point the target becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for 1 hour or until it takes damage, whichever comes first.
