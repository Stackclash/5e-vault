- **Damage**: 1d6 S

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The typical [[5. Mechanics/Items/Magentan Sun Saw (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|magentan sun-saw]], an uncommon item, is a falchion with a curved metal guard that protects your hand. The sword has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a target with this magic sword, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack to reach your fingers around the weapon's curved guard and pull it like a trigger. When you do, a line of whirring blades of light springs from the weapon's edge and rips around the length of the sword, rending and tearing into the target to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) radiant damage to it. The light is a vibrant magenta.
