# Staff of Fire
*Staff, weapon, major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/staff-of-fire.webp#right]]  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Burning Hands.md\|burning hands]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] (3 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Fire.md\|wall of fire]] (4 charges).

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
