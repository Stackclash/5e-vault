# Helm of the Predator
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this helm, you have blindsight out to a range of 30 feet and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, if you spend an action holding and focusing on an item that could identify a creature (such as a lock of hair, a well-worn glove, or a much-used weapon), you become tuned to that creature's physical presence for as long as you are wearing this helm. While tuned in this way, you are aware of their direction from you, their distance from you accurate to within 1000 yards, and which plane of existence they are on if it is different your current one.
