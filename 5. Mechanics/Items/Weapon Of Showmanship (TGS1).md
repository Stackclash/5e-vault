# Weapon of Showmanship
*Minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Weapon-of-Showmanship.webp#right)  


When you reduce a Small or larger creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit against a target with this weapon, you can create a harmless sensory effect or illusion, as per the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Prestidigitation.md\|prestidigitation]] spell, as part of that attack. The effect can appear on the target of the attack or in the area immediately surrounding it.
