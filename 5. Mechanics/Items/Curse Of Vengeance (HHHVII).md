# Curse of Vengeance
*Wondrous item, curse, cursed item, uncommon*

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:

## Curse:

> [!quote]  
> 
> While attuned to this item you become cursed. While cursed, any time you take damage in combat, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 hit points or it does, or until you can't reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.
> 
> This curse ends permanently on both the item and you if the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic is cast on either you or the cursed item.
