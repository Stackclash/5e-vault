This magic spear is made of dark, polished granite and has a large ruby set in its head. While made of stone, it weighs no more than a normal spear and is enchanted to prevent it from shattering. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The spear has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding this spear in a space on or next to a surface made of unworked stone or earth, you can use an action and expend 1 of its charges to plunge the spear into that stone or earth surface. The spear vanishes into the surface and emerges as a sharp stone spike that is 1 foot wide and 10 feet long from another stone or earthen surface that you can see within 60 feet of you, such as the ground or a cave wall. The spike erupts from the surface and forces any creature within a line that is 5 feet wide and 10 feet long to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) piercing damage and is pushed up to 5 feet away from the spike. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

While you're within 60 feet of the stone spike and in a space on or next to a surface of unworked stone or earth, you can use a bonus action to speak the spear's command word to recall it. The stone spike crumbles and the spear inside vanishes back into the surface it came from before reemerging from the surface next to you into your open hand. If you don't have an open hand, it falls to the ground at your feet.
