# Potion of Liquid Form
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this clear potion, you transform into a water-like liquid form for 1 hour. In this form, you gain the following benefits:

- You are able to reshape and manipulate your body into whatever form you wish, so long as your overall volume remains the same.  
- You are able to enter an enemy's space and stop there. You can also move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.  
- While you remain motionless, you are indistinguishable from a puddle, unless an observer succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check.  
- While underwater, you have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks made to hide, and you can take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action as a bonus action.  

Once the hour is over, you return to your normal form. If you return to your normal form in a space that would not support your normal form, you take `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) force damage at the start of each of your turns until you are in a space that can support you.
