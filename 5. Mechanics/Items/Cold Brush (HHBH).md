# Cold Brush
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

An extremely hardy shrub covered in tiny, blue, hair-like leaves. Each of these leaves are tipped with an insulating sap that gradually grows colder over the winter and serves to protect the plant from frigid environments. When brushed on a creature, the sap is said to impart an icy feeling, along with a curious reaction of turning their skin blue.

## Effect:

As part of using this herb, you must rub it on your exposed skin while preparing it. For the next 4 hours, your skin turns a pale blue and becomes icy to the touch. This has no impact on your actual body temperature.
