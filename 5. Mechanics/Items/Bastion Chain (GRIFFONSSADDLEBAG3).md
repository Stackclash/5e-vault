# Bastion Chain
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Chain Mail.md\|chain mail]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Bastion-Chain.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 16
- **Strength**: Requires 13 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 55.0 lbs.

The chains of this armor shift naturally with your movements. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor, which doesn't impose disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks you make. In addition, the chains flow around you reflexively when you're surrounded; the armor's bonus to AC increases to +2 when three or more hostile creatures are within 5 feet of you.
