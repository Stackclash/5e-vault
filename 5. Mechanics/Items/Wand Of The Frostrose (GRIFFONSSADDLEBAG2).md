# Wand of the Frostrose
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wand-of-the-Frostrose.webp#right)  


This icy wand has a magical blue rose frozen at its center. The flower is a frostrose: a rare and delicate rose found only in the coldest parts of the Everglacier.

The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend up to 3 of its charges to create 1 or more Medium ice sculptures on the ground within 60 feet of you, creating 1 sculpture for each charge you expend. Each sculpture must appear in an unoccupied space on the ground you can see within range. Each sculpture is a delicate, thorned rose made of ice and is always a Medium object with 1 hit point and AC 12. A sculpture melts after 1 minute, or 8 hours if it's in an area of extreme cold. If a sculpture falls to 0 hit points, it erupts in an icy blast and is destroyed, causing all creatures within 20 feet of it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. An ice sculpture caught in this explosion erupts automatically, intensifying the blast. A creature takes `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) piercing damage and `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) cold damage on a failed save, plus an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) piercing damage for each explosion it's affected by beyond the first. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much piercing damage and cold damage.

The sculptures softly groan and crackle from the pressure they contain within them. A creature can determine the explosive nature of the sculptures with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) or Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check. Spaces occupied by the icy sculptures are difficult terrain.

The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand melts into a puddle of water, and the frostrose at its center crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
