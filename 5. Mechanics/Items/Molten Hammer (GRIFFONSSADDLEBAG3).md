# Molten Hammer
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Maul.md\|maul]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Molten-Hammer.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This hammer is pulled like glass from molten rock and glows with residual heat from within. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) fire damage to any target it hits.

## Overheat

Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with this hammer, you can cause the hammer to magically overheat. When you do, the attack deals an extra `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage. You then take fire damage equal to half this amount, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
