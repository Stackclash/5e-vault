# Barrier Coral
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

A coral found in areas of high magical saturation, such as along the crossing of leylines or in proximity to a planar portal. It is identifiable by the rainbow-like sheen that enchanted brine deposits make on their exterior, causing it to leave behind lines of magical salt with warding abilities when dragged on the ground.

## Effect:

This herb may be dragged behind you on the ground as you move, creating a magical line that is capable of warding against celestial, fey, fiend, and undead type creatures. If any of these creatures attempt to move over a line created by this herb, they must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are prevented from moving across the line for an hour, after which they may make the saving throw again, ending this effect on a success. In addition, creatures of those types are incapable of teleporting into or out of an enclosed area created by a line from this herb. This herb is capable of drawing a line of up to 60 feet in length.
