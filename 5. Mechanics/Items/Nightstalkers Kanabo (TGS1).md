# Nightstalker's Kanabo
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greatclub.md\|greatclub]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Nightstalkers-Kanabo.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This studded greatclub once belonged to a hungering [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Giant/Oni.md\|oni]] who excelled at subterfuge. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the heavy property. When you hit a sleeping creature with this weapon, that creature takes an extra `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) psychic damage from the attack. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, the target of the attack must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or magically fall asleep until the end of your next turn, the sleeper takes damage, or a creature uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. While the target is asleep, it is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]]. Undead and creatures immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] automatically succeed on the saving throw.

The weapon has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges as a bonus action to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md\|invisibility]] (targeting only yourself ) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleep.md\|sleep]] (3rd-level version) spell from it.
