# Talyard the Great's Wand of Power
*Wand, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Talyard-the-Greats-Wand-of-Power.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This normal-looking spruce stick is actually the wand of a famous drunkard. A drunken creature that sees the stick perceives it as a magnificent, colorful wand that radiates with an awesome power.

This wand has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. While you're drunk and are holding the wand, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Heroism.md\|heroism]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] (2 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Thaumaturgy.md\|thaumaturgy]] (no charges). If you don't have a spellcasting ability modifier, Charisma is your spellcasting ability when casting these spells (minimum +1 modifier).
