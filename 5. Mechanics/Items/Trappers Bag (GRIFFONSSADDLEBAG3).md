# Trapper's Bag
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Trappers-Bag.webp#right)  


This bag clatters around when shaken. Around its base is a toothed, metal rim. Inside the bag is a special demiplane that holds a variety of miscellaneous trapping and adventuring equipment. You can use an action to reach into the bag and pull out up to four random items. Roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) for each item you take from the bag and use the table below to determine what each one is.

`dice: [[Trappers Bag (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^item]]`

| dice: d8 | Item |
|----------|------|
| 1 | Bucket |
| 2 | Pole (10-foot) |
| 3 | String (10 feet) |
| 4 | Block and tackle |
| 5 | Oil flask |
| 6 | Ball bearings (bag of 1,000) |
| 7 | Caltrops (bag of 20) |
| 8 | Hunting trap |
^item

Up to four items can be taken from the bag in this way, either all at once or with multiple uses. It regains all expended uses daily at dawn, at which time any item withdrawn from it magically vanishes and returns to the bag. Such an item vanishes early if you or another creature attempts to sell or trade the item. The bag can also be used as a normal backpack.
