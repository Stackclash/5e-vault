This magic axe is a favorite among lumberjacks. The axe is made entirely of the magically hardened festerwood and sharpened to a menacing edge. The weapon's glimmering yellow pustules leech acid with each attack, causing any target hit by it to take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) acid damage. This acid damage is maximized if the target is a plant creature, a nonmagical plant, or an object made of wood.
