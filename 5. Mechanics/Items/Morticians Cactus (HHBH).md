# Mortician's Cactus
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

While many cacti contain juices that can be sweet and tasty, this cactus is a notable exception as it smells strongly of embalming fluid. That said, even a terrible ability like this can be put to good use by nature, as rodents have been observed rubbing themselves on this plant in order to deter predators attempting to swallow them whole.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you taste and smell terrible. Any creature that makes an attack against you involving biting or using their tongue on you, does so at disadvantage. In addition, you have advantage on any ability check or saving throw made to avoid being swallowed or to be spit out of a creature's stomach.
