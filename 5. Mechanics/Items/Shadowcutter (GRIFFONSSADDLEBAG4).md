# Shadowcutter
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greatsword.md\|greatsword]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Shadowcutter.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This long, curved sword is made from a dark metal and has a rippled edge. When you swing it, tufts of raw shadowstuff split and tear along its edge, as if you were slicing through smoke. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse property. If you're proficient with longswords, you are proficient with the shadowcutter.

## Dark Draw

When you draw this weapon and make an attack with it as part of the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action on the same turn, you can replace the first attack you make with it with a special strike. When you do, the sword swings out in a devastating arc, which extends from you in a 15-foot cone of wicked shadow. Make a melee attack with the sword against each creature within the area, with a separate attack roll for each target: on a hit, a target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage from the attack. If any of the sword's `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) damage dice roll a 6, the target must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the start of your next turn. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until 1 minute has passed.
