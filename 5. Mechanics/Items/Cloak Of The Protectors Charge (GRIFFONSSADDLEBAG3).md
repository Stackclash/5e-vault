# Cloak of the Protector's Charge
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Cloak-of-the-Protectors-Charge.webp#right)  


When you finish a long rest while wearing this cloak, choose up to four other creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. You and those creatures then gain 10 temporary hit points. In addition, the cloak has 5 charges and regains `dice:1d3+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the cloak, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to grant a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) temporary hit points.

Alternatively, while wearing the cloak, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to take a special [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action. To do so, choose a friendly creature that you can see within 60 feet of you that has no more than half its hit points remaining. You then move up to your speed in a straight line toward that creature. When you do, the creature immediately gains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) temporary hit points, which remain until the start of your next turn. If you don't move your full speed directly toward the target, any excess movement from the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] is lost.
