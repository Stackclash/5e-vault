# Interrogator's Baton
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

This member of the cordyceps family is known for its pitch black coloration, long shape, and slimy skin. Like other cordyceps, this herb is parasitic in natureâ€”in this case, it infects a victim's mind and induces a feeling of apathy and compliance. The slime from this herb is particularly potent, leading interrogators to use it to coat their tools and add an alchemical edge to their distasteful work.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) charges. As an action, you may spend a charge to rub this herb on either one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition, coating it with a parasitic slime. For the next ten minutes, any damage inflicted by a coated weapon or piece of ammunition is not considered as 'harmful' for the sake of ending a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] condition on an afflicted creature. Once this herb loses all charges, it becomes dried out and is considered worthless.
