# Reversal Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While your feet are wearing these boots, they become extremely dexterous and flexible similar to that of a gorilla's. You are able to hold things comfortably in your feet, and you have a climb speed equal to your walking speed.
