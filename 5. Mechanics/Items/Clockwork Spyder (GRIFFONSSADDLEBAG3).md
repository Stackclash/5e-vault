# Clockwork Spyder
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*

This brass mechanical spider can fold its legs inward, allowing it to be worn as a brooch, hair pin, or similar. While being worn in this way, the spider appears as a normal pin. You can use a bonus action to speak the spider's command word followed by a single word instruction, such as "unlock" or "disarm." The spider then springs to life and carries out the task to the best of its ability, using its numerous legs as [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]]. The spider has a +7 bonus to Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks, as well as any ability check it makes using [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]]. The spider can remain animated for up to 10 minutes. Each time it's given a new spoken command, it uses a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. When you give the spider an instruction, and again on each of your turns as a bonus action while it remains animated, you can mentally command the spider to move up to 20 feet.

Other than using its legs as [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]], the spider can perform two unique tasks:

## Record

The spider can record audio, up to its remaining animation time, for later playback. You can cause previously recorded audio to play from a small speaker on the spider by tapping it twice. Tapping it twice again stops the recording. Any recording the spider has is lost when it's commanded to record again.

## Tripwire

The spider creates a tripwire up to 10 feet in length using a spool of thread from its mechanical abdomen, connecting either end of the tripwire to a solid surface. The tripwire is nearly [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], requiring a passive Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) score of 17 or higher to notice it, and it gives no resistance when broken. While you're within 1,000 feet of a tripwire created in this way, you are magically made aware of it when it's broken, such as if a creature walks through it. When this happens, you only know which wire is broken, but not what caused it to break. You can have up to three tripwires at a time, which remain for up to 8 hours. Creating a fourth tripwire causes the first one to break.

You can mentally deactivate the spider early using a bonus action. The spider regains all its used animation time daily at dawn.

The spider is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has AC 15, 10 hit points, a walking and climbing speed of 20 feet, and has resistance to all damage. If the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mending.md\|mending]] spell is cast on the spider while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) hit points. If the spider drops to 0 hit points, it can't be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.
