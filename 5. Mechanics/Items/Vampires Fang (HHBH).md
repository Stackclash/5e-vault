# Vampire's Fang
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A pernicious and spiky herb found buried into cliffsides and unassuming hiking spots. In order to compensate for poor soil quality, this herb uses its hollow thorns as needles that drain the blood of any hapless creatures that stumble upon them.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) charges. As an action, you may wrap the roots of this herb around your arm while leaving its spiky flower held in a free hand. So long a sthis herb is wrapped around your arm, whenever a creature that has blood in its body dies within 5 feet of you, you may expend a charge in order to use your reaction to drain that creature's blood, granting you temporary hit points equal to their challenge rating (minimum of 1).
