# War Pick of Corrosion
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/War Pick.md\|war pick]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/War-Pick-of-Corrosion.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 piercing
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This weapon resembles the head of an ancient black dragon: its two horns curl behind its head to form the weapon's sharp pick. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) acid damage to any target it hits. This extra acid damage is doubled if the target is made of metal or is wearing metal armor.

The weapon has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the war pick, you can expend 1 of its charges to increase the pick's acid damage by `dice:3d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d4`), to a total of `dice:4d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d4`) extra acid damage, for that attack; this acid damage is still doubled if the target is made of metal or is wearing metal armor. If the target is wearing metal armor, it must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or the armor takes a cumulative -2 penalty to the AC it offers, to a minimum of 10 AC, which lasts until it finishes a short or long rest.
