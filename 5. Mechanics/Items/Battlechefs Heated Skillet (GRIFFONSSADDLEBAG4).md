# Battlechef's Heated Skillet
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]]), rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Battlechefs-Heated-Skillet.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This iron skillet is magically light and wieldy in your grasp, allowing you to swing it as a weapon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you're proficient with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cooks Utensils.md\|cook's utensils]], you're proficient with the battlechef's heated skillet.

The skillet has 3 charges and regains all expended charges whenever you spend at least 1 hour cooking with it, which can be done over the course of a short rest. The first creature to eat a meal that was cooked in the skillet gains 5 temporary hit points.

When you make an attack with the weapon, you can speak one of its three command words to expend 1 or more of its charges: "hot" (1 charge), "hotter" (2 charges), or "hottest" (3 charges). If the attack hits, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage for each expended charge.
