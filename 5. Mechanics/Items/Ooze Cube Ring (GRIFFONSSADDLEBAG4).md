# Ooze Cube Ring
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Ooze-Cube-Ring.webp#right)  


This cubic, platinum ring has a sliver of a gelatinous cube inset at its top instead of a gemstone. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

- Unaligned oozes are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.  
- You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. However, the ring doesn't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.  
- You can use an action to make an unarmed strike with the hand wearing the ring. Your hand turns gelatinous and tendril-like for the duration of the attack. On a hit, the target takes acid damage equal to `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) + your Strength modifier, instead of the normal damage for an unarmed strike. Your hand then returns to normal.
