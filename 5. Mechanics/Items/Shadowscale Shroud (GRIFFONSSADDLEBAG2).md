# Shadowscale Shroud
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Scale Mail.md\|scale mail]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Shadowscale-Shroud.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 45.0 lbs.

Enchanted by powerful drow, this dark and shadowy dragon scale armor protects you from both damage and light. While wearing this armor, you have a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to necrotic damage, and if you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by it.

In addition, this armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks, and when you attempt to hide in areas of dim light or darkness while wearing it, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll.

## Shadow Shift

While in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use an action to turn [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]]. You remain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] for up to 10 minutes or until you use a bonus action to become visible again. You become visible early if you enter an area of bright light or if you attack or cast a spell. While you're [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] in this way, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant, and you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. In addition, while you're [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] in this way, you can't be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors against your will.

Once this property of the armor has been used, it shouldn't be used again until the next dusk. Each time it is used again before then, you must expend either 6 Hit Dice, rolling each one and taking force damage equal to the total rolled, or suffer one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] (your choice). Force damage taken in this way ignores resistance and immunity.
