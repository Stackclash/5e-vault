# Raven Queen's Boon
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This boon takes the form of a necklace strung with the Raven Queen's symbol and several feathers plucked from a freshly slain raven. While wearing and attuned to it, you have advantage on death saving throws. In addition, when you make a successful weapon attack against a target, you may choose to deal an additional `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) necrotic damage. Once this ability has been used once, it may not be used again until you complete a short or long rest.
