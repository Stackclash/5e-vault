# Battlebrew Bomb
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Battlebrew-Bomb.webp#right)  


This fist-sized keg contains 1 ounce of extremely old dwarven liquor which is as strong as it is explosive. A built-in locking mechanism keeps the barrel sealed until it's ready to be used. You can use an action to twist the sides of the keg and throw it at a point that you can see up to 20 feet away from you, splitting the keg open on impact and spraying the area with a fine mist of the liquor. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The next time that a target that was sprayed by the liquor takes fire damage within 1 minute, it takes an extra `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage as the liquor ignites.
