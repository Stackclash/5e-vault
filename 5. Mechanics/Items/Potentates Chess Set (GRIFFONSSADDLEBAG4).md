# Potentate's Chess Set
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Potentates-Chess-Set.webp#right)  


When found, this chess set is missing half its pieces. The set is contained within a case, which often doubles as the board when opened up. The case itself isn't magical, but the pieces within it are. While the set is on your person and within its case, you can use an action to invoke one of its magical pieces. When you do, a spectral, Medium replica of that piece appears at your location before beginning to move.

A spectral piece can move appropriately to how a normal piece would in a game of chess, in increments of 5 feet and up to a maximum range of 60 feet. For instance, a pawn could move up to 5 feet, but a bishop could move up to 60 feet in a straight lineâ€”albeit diagonally. If you're not using a square grid, a piece can move anywhere within its range at the GM's discretion.

When you invoke a piece and move it in this way, it expends that piece's use until the next dawn. The number of each piece you have when found is listed in its description. Use a spell attack bonus of +7 and save DC of 15 for each piece, or +8 and 16 if you have a complete set.

## Pawn (8):

The pawn moves up to 5 feet, or 10 feet if it's the first round of combat, and attacks a target within the space. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. Alternatively, you can invoke the pawn as a reaction when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you.

## Bishop (2):

The bishop moves in a line that's 5 feet wide and up to 60 feet long. Each friendly creature within the line regains `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) hit points.

## Knight (2):

The knight moves 10 feet in a straight line and then turns left or right (your choice) before moving another 5 feet. At the end of the movement, it attacks the target within its space. If the target is Medium or smaller, the attack is made with advantage. On a hit, the target takes `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) force damage. If you roll an 8 on any of the damage dice, the knight's use isn't expended.

## Rook (2):

The rook moves in a line that's 5 feet wide and up to 60 feet long. Each hostile creature within the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) force damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Queen (1):

The queen moves up to 60 feet in a straight line. At the end of the movement, the queen can make up to five attacks divided as you choose between any targets that you can see within 5 feet of it. On a hit, a target takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) force damage. If you roll a 20 on the attack roll for any of the attacks, the queen's use isn't expended.

## King (1):

When you invoke the king, you cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Antilife Shell.md\|antilife shell]] from it. If you haven't expended the use of all your rooks, you can also expend one of their uses as part of the same action to teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you.

A spectral piece disappears immediately after it's used. A piece's movement is blocked by total cover. A complete set has 16 pawns, 4 bishops, 4 knights, 4 rooks, 2 queens, and 2 kings. You add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to play a game with the chess set.
