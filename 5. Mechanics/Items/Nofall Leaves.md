# Nofall Leaves
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

After a snowstorm, all that can be seen is a blanket of whiteâ€”except for the patches of bright green that indicate the presence of the nofall bush and its fuzzy leaves. This herb secretes a hydrophobic oil across its leaves, ostensibly as a method of removing any snow that may prevent it from performing much needed photosynthesis. When this oil is rubbed on the soles of one's shoes, it changes the surface tension of the snow wherever it touches, causing it to be able to support a surprising amount of weight in unexpected distributions.

## Effect:

As part of using this herb, you must rub it on the soles of your shoes, or your feet if you walk barefoot. For 8 hours after using this herb, you do not sink into deep snow.
