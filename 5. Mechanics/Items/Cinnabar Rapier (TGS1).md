# Cinnabar Rapier
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Rapier.md\|rapier]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Cinnabar-Rapier.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magic rapier's blade is alchemically coated in a thin but toxic layer of cinnabar. The weapon has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 or more of its charges. The blade's poison leeches into the blood of the creature you struck to deal an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) poison damage for each charge expended in this way.
