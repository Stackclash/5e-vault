# Gentleman's Saber
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Gentlemans-Saber.webp#right)  


This elegant blade has a gently curved handle and a guard in the shape of a shield. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and if you make an opportunity attack with the weapon and hit, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) slashing damage from the attack.

If you're attuned to the weapon, the weapon's shieldlike guard changes its design to match your family crest. In addition, the sword has 3 charges, which you can use only if you're attuned to it. When you're hit by a ranged attack while holding the sword, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to hold the blade in front of you. Roll a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`). A domed, spectral barrier appears from the blade's tip, granting you a bonus to AC against ranged attacks equal to the number rolled on the `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack. The sword regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
