# Glutton Cutlery
*Wondrous Item, common, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

A set of ivory cutlery consisting of a fork, spoon, and knife. Any food eaten from these cutlery items does not satiate feelings of hunger, although it still provides nutrition, and the capacity of the eater's stomach remains unchanged. This magical effect stops functioning if any of the cutlery pieces are more than 10 feet away from each other.
