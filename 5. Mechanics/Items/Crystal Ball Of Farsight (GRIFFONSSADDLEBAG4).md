# Crystal Ball of Farsight
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Crystal-Ball-of-Farsight.webp#right)  


This [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]] is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Arcane Eye.md\|arcane eye]] spell with it. The spell ends early if a creature touches the magical eye; the creature then knows that it had been observed by divination magic. For the duration of the spell, you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]], and the crystal mimics the appearance of one of your eyes.
