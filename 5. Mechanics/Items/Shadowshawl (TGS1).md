# Shadowshawl
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shadowshawl.webp#right)  


This light gray shawl is made of thick fabric that looks like woven spider webs. While wearing this shawl with its hood up, your face is hidden within a small pocket of magical darkness. You can see through this darkness from beneath the hood as if it were nonmagical. If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait while the hood is up. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
