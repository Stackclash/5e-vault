# Boots of Elvenkind
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/boots-of-elvenkind.webp#right]]  


While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks that rely on moving silently.
