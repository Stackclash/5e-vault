# Ring of Seething
*Ring, cursed item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Seething.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This dark band is cool to the touch and has several cracks throughout its otherwise smooth body. When you attune to the ring, choose a creature type: aberration, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead. While wearing the ring, its normally cool band glows red hot when a creature of the chosen type is within 60 feet of you. In addition, you have advantage on any saving throw you make to resist being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] by a creature of that type. While seemingly radiating heat, the ring feels only faintly warm to you. Small pieces of the metal band hover above the surface of the ring when glowing in this way.

## Curse

Once you attune to the ring and place it on your finger, you can't remove it unless targeted by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell. While cursed, you have disadvantage on any Charisma check or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) check you make that involves a creature of the chosen type. In addition, while you're within 60 feet of one or more creatures of that type, you have disadvantage on attack rolls that target a creature of a different type.
