This wicked dagger can absorb the shadows cast by your enemies. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a Small or larger hostile creature with a melee attack using this dagger, you can choose to absorb that creature's shadow as part of the attack. When you do, that creature no longer casts a shadow, and the dagger becomes shrouded in a dark haze that extends to you while you hold the dagger. While this haze is also surrounding you, you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] in areas of dim light and darkness.

The dark haze surrounds the dagger for 10 minutes or until you end it as a bonus action. The haze ends early after you attack or cast a spell. If a creature is hit by the dagger while it's shrouded in this haze, the creature takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage from the attack. This bonus damage increases to `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) if the creature hit by the dagger is missing its shadow. Once the haze ends, the shadow immediately returns to the creature from whom it was taken.

You can only have 1 shadow absorbed in this way at a time. Once you steal a creature's shadow, you can't steal that same creature's shadow again until the following dusk.

## Curse

You have vulnerability to radiant damage while you're attuned to this weapon.
