# Marshwarden Bow
*Rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Marshwarden-bow.webp#right)  


This bow is made of twisted cypress roots and covered in long, stringy moss. The bowstring is always slick with water. Nonmagical arrows fired from this bow deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) acid or poison damage on a hit (your choice each time). When you're in a forest or swamp and are hidden from a creature, missing with an attack against it doesn't reveal your position.

## Wretched Burst

When you hit a target with an arrow fired from this bow, you can cause it to erupt in a putrid cloud centered on the target, duplicating the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stinking Cloud.md\|stinking cloud]] spell (save DC 15). This version of the spell doesn't require [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]]. Once this property of the bow has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn or until it's spent at least 1 hour submerged in naturally occurring swamp water.
