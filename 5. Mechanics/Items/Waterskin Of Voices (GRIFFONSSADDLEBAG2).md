# Waterskin of Voices
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Waterskin-of-Voices.webp#right)  


This leather waterskin has a magical beverage inside that allows you to briefly alter your voice. When found, the waterskin has `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) servings. You can drink 1 of the servings while holding the waterskin using an action. When you do, choose a voice from a creature you've heard or one from your imagination. The next 25 words you speak within 10 minutes sound virtually indistinguishable from the voice you chose, though a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) check reveals that the voice is magically altered. If the voice you chose belongs to another creature, that creature automatically knows that the voice is altered.
