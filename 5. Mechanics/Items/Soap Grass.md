# Soap Grass
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Growing in patches of soil with a high alkaline content, soap grass is exactly what it sounds like: grass with the cleaning property of soap. It is easily identified among its mundane peers by its milky-white colouration, and frothy coating.

## Effect:

You may spend 10 minutes rubbing this herb on yourself. If you do so, you become clean of all dirt and muck.
