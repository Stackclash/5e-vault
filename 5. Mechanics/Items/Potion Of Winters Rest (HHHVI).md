# Potion of Winter's Rest
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This potion is constantly cool to the touch and appears to have snowflakes floating in the middle of it. If you willingly drink this potion, you enter a comatose state and fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] and then immediately become encased in a block of ice that extends half a foot away from your body in either direction. While inside this ice block, you are considered behind "total cover" in all directions. You also do not age, require food, drink, or sleep, and any physical ailments including diseases and poisons halt their effect. If you were on 0 hit points you are also instantly stabilised. You instantly wake up if the ice block is destroyed, and all of these effects end. The ice block has AC 12, 30 hit points, is immune to psychic and poison damage and is vulnerable to fire damage. The ice block does not melt under nonmagical sources of heat.

If you unwillingly drink this potion, you may make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid being encased in the ice block, taking only `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) cold damage instead.
