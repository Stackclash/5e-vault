# Helm of the Dawn Guardian
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Helm-of-the-Dawn-Guardian.webp#right)  


This golden helmet radiates a gentle warmth, like the light of the sun. While wearing the helmet, your eyes glow with a soft radiance, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC. If you're in sunlight, the bonus increases to +2.

The helmet's warmth extends out from you in a 10-foot radius while you wear it. If you have at least 17 levels in the paladin class, the radius increases to 30 feet. The weapon attacks of friendly creatures within that area deal an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) radiant damage on a hit. This extra damage increases to `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) if the attack is made with a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sun Blade.md\|sun blade]].

While wearing the helmet, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sunburst.md\|sunburst]] spell (save DC 17). This version of the spell affects a 60-foot cone that originates from you, instead of its normal area of effect. Once this spell has been cast from the helmet, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
