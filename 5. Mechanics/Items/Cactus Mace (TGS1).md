![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Cactus-Mace.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magical weapon's head is an enchanted cactus that rapidly regrows its missing needles. The first target hit by this weapon on each of your turns takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) piercing damage from the attack.
