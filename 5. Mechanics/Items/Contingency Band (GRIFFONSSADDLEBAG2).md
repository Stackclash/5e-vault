# Contingency Band
*Ring, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Contingency-Band.webp#right)  


Each of this leather ring's three braided bands bears the design of a dark, winding serpent. You can use an action to submerge the ring in a potion of healing or similar healing draft. If the ring is left to sit in a potion for 1 minute in this way, the ring magically consumes it and any of its healing properties. For each potion the ring has consumed, one of its dark serpents glows with a faint red light. The ring can have up to 3 consumed potions at a time.

Immediately after you take damage while wearing the ring, you can use your reaction to speak its command word and gain the healing effects of one of the ring's consumed potions (your choice). The consumed potion is then lost, and one of the ring's serpents becomes dark once more.
