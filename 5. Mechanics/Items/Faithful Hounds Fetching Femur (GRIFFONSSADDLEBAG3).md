# Faithful Hound's Fetching Femur
*Rod, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Faithful-Hounds-Fetching-Femur.webp#right)  


This rod is actually a large bone from a nondescript beast. A small bell and engraved tag hang from its side by a leather strap. The rod can also be used as a magic club that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The rod has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the faithful hound spell with the following changes:

- The spell ends early if you cast the spell again.  
- The hound has an attack bonus of +10.  
- You can use a bonus action to move the hound to another space that you can see within 30 feet of you.  
- You can use an action to look through the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] hound's eyes until the start of your next turn. The hound has [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to 30 feet, can see [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] creatures, and can see into the Ethereal Plane. During this time, you are blind with regard to your own senses.  
- You can use an action to throw the rod at a target that you can see within 30 feet of you (attack bonus +10). On a hit, the rod deals `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage, plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice), and the hound immediately moves to the target's space and attacks it. Hit or miss, the hound then returns the rod to your hand or drops it at your feet (your choice). It then remains in a space of your choice within 5 feet of you until it's moved again.  

When you expend the last charge from the rod, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the hound wrenches the bone from your hand and runs away with it, ending the spell early and wasting the action to cast it. The bone then reappears in a random location 1,000 feet away from you after 1 hour.
