# Snugglebeast (Owlbear)
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Snugglebeast-Owlbear.webp#right)  


When a creature regains hit points at the end of a short rest by spending one or more of its Hit Dice, that creature can regain extra hit points if it spends that short rest snuggling with one of these enchanted toys. The common [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Owlbear.md\|owlbear]] variant of the snugglebeast restores `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) hit points. Once this property of the snugglebeast has been used by a creature, that creature can't benefit from the same snugglebeast again in this way until it finishes a long rest.
