# Scroll of Comedic Endings
*Scroll, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scroll-of-Comedic-Endings.webp#right)  


This scroll has been carelessly flattened, folded, and scrawled on with childlike scribbles. In doing so, some of its original scripts and diagrams have been covered or replaced, and a large anvil has been proudly drawn at its center. A creature investigating the scroll can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check. On a success, it determines that, while the scroll's original spell is no longer usable, its magic has merely been changed.

Using an action to read the scroll summons a massive anvil 20 to 60 feet in the air centered above a point that you can see within 120 feet of you. The anvil is roughly a 10-foot cube and requires enough space in the air to accommodate it when it appears. If there isn't enough space, the effect fails, and both the scroll and the action to read it are wasted. Once used, the scroll bursts into a small plume of colorful confetti.

Once the anvil appears, it hovers briefly in the air before falling to the ground below. The anvil weighs 500 pounds and has similarly scrawled designs on it to match the contents of the scroll. Each creature below the anvil in a 10-foot square centered on the point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:5d10|noform|avg` (`5d10`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the anvil. On a success, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage, is not knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]], and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space away from the anvil. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success and moving it to the nearest unoccupied space.

The anvil remains on the ground for 1 minute, at which point it vanishes with a comedic pop.
