# Quiver of Seasons
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Quiver-of-Seasons.webp#right)  


This slender quiver is decorated with a forest of silhouetted trees. You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to speak the quiver's command word to change its season, which also changes its color and design: Spring (green, trees with silver leaves), Summer (yellow, rays of silver sunlight), Autumn (orange, silver leaves falling), or Winter (blue, silver veins on trees).

The quiver has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack using a weapon to fire ammunition drawn from this quiver, you can expend 1 of the quiver's charges to infuse that ammunition with the quiver's seasonal magic. That ammunition gains the following benefits depending on the quiver's associated season:

## Spring

The ammunition is wrapped by verdant brambles. On a hit, the brambles wrap around the target and deal an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the brambles until the end of your next turn. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the brambles on a success.

## Summer

The ammunition is scorched by wildfire. On a hit, flames erupt from it that deal an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage to the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage at the start of its next turn.

## Autumn

The ammunition is touched by decaying fungus. On a hit, a cloud of sickening spores bursts from it that deals an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) necrotic damage to the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of your next turn. This has no effect on undead or constructs.

## Winter

The ammunition is covered in biting frost. On a hit, ice splinters outward from it that deals an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) cold damage. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this effect, it can't use reactions, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, but not both. Regardless of the target's abilities, it can't make more than one attack during its turn for the duration.

The ammunition returns to normal after the attack.

Other types of magic ammunition containers of this kind exist, such as a bolt case of seasons meant for crossbows, though quivers are most common.
