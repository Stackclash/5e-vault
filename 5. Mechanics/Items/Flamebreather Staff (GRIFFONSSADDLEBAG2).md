- **Damage**:

  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This red, hollow quarterstaff releases a plume of fire when spun. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) fire damage.

In addition, while holding the quarterstaff, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to release a gout of flame from its end, duplicating the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Burning Hands.md\|burning hands]] spell (save DC 13). This property of the quarterstaff can't be used again until the next dawn.
