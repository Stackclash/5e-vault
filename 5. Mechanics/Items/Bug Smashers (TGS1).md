# Bug Smashers
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bug-Smashers.webp#right)  


This grotesque pair of gloves are made using the barbed exoskeleton and harvested remains of a giant centipede. When you roll a 20 on an unarmed attack roll using these knuckles, the target takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the start of your next turn. Unarmed attacks with these gloves deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice).
