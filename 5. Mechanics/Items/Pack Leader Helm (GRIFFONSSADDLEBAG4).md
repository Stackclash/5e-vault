# Pack Leader Helm
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Pack-Leader-Helm.webp#right)  


This dark silver helm looks like a snarling wolf. While wearing it, dogs and wolves understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them. In addition, lycanthropes have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

You can use a bonus action while wearing the helmet to emit a supernatural howl, which is audible out to a range of 300 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you and up to four other creatures of your choice that you can see and can hear the howl have advantage on attack rolls made against any target that's also within 5 feet of one of their allies, provided that the ally isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]]. For the duration, each creature's speed is also increased by 10 feet. Once this property of the helm has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
