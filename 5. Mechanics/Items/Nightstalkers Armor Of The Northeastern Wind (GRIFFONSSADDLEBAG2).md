# Nightstalker's Armor of the Northeastern Wind
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Nightstalkers-Armor-of-the-Northeastern-Wind.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This unusual armor is composed of blue metal plates with a horned helm, and was tempered by the frigid breath of an oni.

## Retributive Cold

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you while wearing this armor, you can use your reaction to deal `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage to that creature.

## Freezing Fog

While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gaseous Form.md\|gaseous form]] spell from it, targeting only yourself, with the following changes:

- You take the form of a frigid cloud of fog, creating illusory frost on objects you touch.  
- You can take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action while in this form. When you do, your attacks are unarmed strikes that deal `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage, instead of their normal damage.  
- You can use the armor's Retributive Cold property.  
- The spell has a duration of 1 minute.  

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
