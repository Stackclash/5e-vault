# Starmetal Shard Spear
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spear]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Starmetal-Shard-Spear.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 P
  - Two-handed: 1d8 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]

This weapon's otherwise small blade is made larger by 3 sharp fragments of starmetal that remain magically connected to it. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you hit a creature with an attack using the head of this spear, you can choose to leave 1 of the fragments embedded in its body. As a bonus action, you can speak the spear's command word to cause all embedded shards to magically return to the blade of the spear, flying through the air and avoiding creatures and objects to do so. When you do, the target takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) slashing damage for each embedded shard as it leaves the body. If all 3 shards are embedded in the same creature when you speak the command word, the creature's speed is also halved until the end of your next turn. If the spear is ever more than 120 feet away from a shard, the shard magically returns to the spear without harming the creature it was embedded in.

Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the spear, the weapon flies back to your hand.
