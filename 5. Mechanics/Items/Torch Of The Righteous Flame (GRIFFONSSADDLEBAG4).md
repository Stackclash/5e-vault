# Torch of the Righteous Flame
*Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Torch-of-the-Righteous-Flame.webp#right)  


This magic torch functions the same as a normal one, but doesn't burn out after 1 hour. Once the torch is lit, it continues to burn until it's extinguished. While the torch is on your person, you have resistance to fire damage.

The torch has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the torch, you can use an action to use up to two of the following properties. Each property expends 1 charge from the torch when it's used unless it says otherwise.

## Alight Flame

If the torch isn't lit, you can magically light it (without expending a charge) and produce a flame from the brazier.

## Bursting Flame

The flame explodes. Each creature within 20 feet of the flame must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:10d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the flame was [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], the save is made with disadvantage. The flame is then extinguished.

## Invisible Flame

The flame and its light become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] for 10 minutes, although it still casts a warm glow on the inside of the brazier. For the duration, while you're holding the torch, you gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] within a 20-foot radius of the flame.

## Send Flame

You send the flame out from the brazier to a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The flame remains for 10 minutes, until you use this property again (which doesn't expend a charge), or until you move within 5 feet of it, at which time it magically returns to the brazier. For the duration, any creature other than you that moves within 5 feet of the flame for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage.
