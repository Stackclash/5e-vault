# Adventurer's Overcoat
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Adventurers-Overcoat.webp#right)  


This well-traveled and now faded overcoat has been worn by countless other mountaineering adventurers. A thin layer of frost hangs along the coat's hem. While wearing the coat, you and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to cold damage.
