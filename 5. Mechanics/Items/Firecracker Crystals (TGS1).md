# Firecracker Crystals
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Firecracker-Crystals.webp#right)  


These multicolored crystals are usually purchased in small bags at festivals and holiday events. As an action, you can throw 1 of these 1-inch crystals against a solid surface within 20 feet of you to crack it apart. When a crystal breaks, it releases the magic inside. The magic ends at the end of your turn and is entirely sensory.

A bag of the small crystals comes with `dice:1d4+8|noform|avg|text(10)` (`1d4 + 8`) crystals inside. Roll a number of d8s equal to the number of crystals in the bag and record each number rolled. Use these numbers to determine the kinds of crystals found in the bag using the table below:

**Firecracker Crystal Colors**

`dice: [[Firecracker Crystals (TGS1).md#^firecracker-crystal-colors]]`

| dice: d8 | Color | Result |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Red | Releases a harmless 5-foot tall flame. |
| 2 | Orange | Releases a small flash of bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for another 5 feet, followed by the smell of spices and citrus. |
| 3 | Yellow | Releases small spiraling motes of energy that fizz and fly about in a 5-foot radius. |
| 4 | Green | Releases a cloud of bright, verdant smoke that fills a 5-foot sphere and smells both foul and sickly sweet. |
| 5 | Blue | Releases a series of comically large bubbles that float outward from the point of impact in a 5-foot radius. |
| 6 | Purple | Releases the sound of music. The song is random, and plays only enough to make it recognizable as music. |
| 7 | White | Releases a dazzling display of sparkling glitter in a 5-foot radius from the point of impact. |
| 8 | Black | Releases a mystery effect. Roll on the table again when using this crystal to determine its effect. If you roll an 8, roll the d8 again. |
