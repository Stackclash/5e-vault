# Shadow Hunter Bow
*Generic Variant, very rare*  


This ebony black bow is crafted from the dark spine of a yeth hound, and arrows fired from this bow hunt down their prey like the creature it was crafted from. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Arrows fired from this bow are considered magical and ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
