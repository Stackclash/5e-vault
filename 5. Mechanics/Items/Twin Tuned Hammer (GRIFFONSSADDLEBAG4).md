# Twin-Tuned Hammer
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Light Hammer.md\|light hammer]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Twin-Tuned-Hammer.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 bludgeoning
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This two-pronged hammer vibrates with a powerful force whenever it strikes a target. Despite the thunderous nature, the sound it creates can only be heard up to 30 feet away. A target hit with the hammer takes an extra `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) thunder damage from the attack, or `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) thunder damage if the target is made of stone, metal, or glass.

Whenever the hammer deals this bonus thunder damage, it continues to vibrate until the end of your next turn. If you're a bard, you gain the following benefits while holding it for the duration:

- Any target you grant a Bardic Inspiration die to also gains an additional Bardic Inspiration die, which is a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`). This `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) can't be used at the same time as the other Bardic Inspiration die, and lasts until the end of your next turn.  
- You can roll a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) and add it to your bard spell save DC whenever you cast a spell that deals thunder damage. This bonus ends immediately after you cast the spell.
