This septum barbell is made from tempered gold and studded with rubies. While wearing this ring as a nose piercing, your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, and you have advantage on Strength checks. In addition, your carrying capacity doubles, and you can perfectly recall any path you've traveled within the last 24 hours.
