# Cube of Teleportation
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Cube-of-Teleportation.webp#right)  


This hefty, metal cube is about 6 inches on a side and weighs 3 pounds. One of the cube's sides looks like a metallic stamp, and is made of countless interlocking and shifting panels that reconfigure themselves to magically generate a new, unique sigil sequence daily at dawn, as described in the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleportation Circle.md\|teleportation circle]] spell. Its five other sides are flat and blank, or, at the GM's discretion, have up to 5 different sigil sequences recorded onto them.

If you find a permanent [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleportation Circle.md\|teleportation circle]], you can place and hold one of the cube's flat sides against the circle for 1 hour, focusing on it for the duration (as if concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the cube for the full duration, the circle's sigil sequence is recorded onto the cube's face. If a sigil was already on the cube's face, it's replaced by the new one.

The cube has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you hold one of the cube's recorded sigil sequences on the ground face-down and focus on it for 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell), the cube expends 1 of its charges and duplicates the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleportation Circle.md\|teleportation circle]] circle spell, using the sigil sequence from the cube's face to form the spell's [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleportation Circle.md\|teleportation circle]] on the ground below it.

Alternatively, you can hold the stamp side of the cube on the ground and focus on it for 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the cube for the full duration, it magically applies its unique sigil sequence onto the ground in a 10-foot-diameter [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleportation Circle.md\|teleportation circle]], provided that there's enough space to do so. This circle remains for 1 hour, and can only be used as a destination circle for the duration. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, unless you use an action to expend 1 of the cube's charges to generate a new sigil sequence and regain the use of this property. Once you've placed a unique [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleportation Circle.md\|teleportation circle]] in this way, you can use this side of the cube as if it were a normal sigil sequence recording for the generated circle.
