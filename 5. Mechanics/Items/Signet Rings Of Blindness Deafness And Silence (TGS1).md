# Signet Rings of Blindness, Deafness, and Silence
*Ring, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Signet-Rings-of-Blindness-Deafness-and-Silence.webp#right)  


Each of these three signets is decorated with the carving of a skull and a pair of skeletal hands that cover either its eyes (blindness), ears (deafness), or mouth (in an area of silence). Each ring has 1 charge, which it regains each day at dawn. If you are wearing the corresponding signet when you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], or in an area of magical silence, you can expend the ring's charge (no action required) to be cured of the condition or speak a word or phrase (such as a verbal arcane components) that can be heard through magical silence. Wearing the rings together as a set combines their collective charges: potentially allowing you to use one ring's properties multiple times.
