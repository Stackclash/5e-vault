# Demon Bomb
*Wondrous item, explosive, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This bomb is a black iron sphere filled with balor ashes and explosive elements and is roughly the size of an orange. You may spend an action to light and throw this item at a point within 20 feet. At the end of your next turn, this item will explode, forcing all creatures within 20 feet of it to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:15d6|noform|avg` (`15d6`) fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The explosion ignites flammable objects in this area that aren't being worn or carried.
