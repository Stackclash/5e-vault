# Troll's Snot
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

These hanging, pale-green vines grow in along, interconnected formation that resembles the infamous bogeys expelled from a troll's nostrils when it sneezes. The sticky nature of the plant allows it to capture insects like a spider's web. When birds inevitably feed on these insects, they also inadvertently consume the vine's seed pods, causing them to spread them far and wide. This remarkable trait has caused the troll's snot to be found all across the land (as disgusting as that sentence may be). When these seeds are pressed into an oil and rubbed on one's hands, they exude a similar sticky substance to the plant, which some cultures have used to accomplish a variety of feats.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, your hands exude a sticky substance that grants you advantage on Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) checks made to climb or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#grapple\|grapple]] something, and you cannot be disarmed of an object in your hand involuntarily.
