# Sonar Arrow
*Ammunition ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Arrow.md\|arrow]]), minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Sonar-Arrow.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

This long, dark arrow looks as though it's been pierced through a bat. A target hit by this arrow takes an extra `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) thunder damage. Hit or miss, when the arrow first impacts with a creature, object, or other solid surface, it emits a brief, magical frequency, which is audible out to a range of 120 feet. Every creature that isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] within the sound's range magically knows the location of every other physical creature and any obvious, uncovered object within the frequency's area at that moment. The arrow then loses its magic and becomes a normal arrow.

A creature that has the Keen Hearing trait gains a +5 bonus to any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check it makes until the end of its next turn after hearing the frequency. If the arrow hits a creature with this trait, it takes an extra `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) thunder damage from the attack, instead of `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`).

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as sonar bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
