# Metallurgist's Grip
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Metallurgists-Grip.webp#right)  


This plated metal gauntlet extends up your arm. The armored plates are extensively corroded. If you're missing a hand or arm, the item can function as a prosthesis for it. While you're attuned to the gauntlet, it can't be removed from you against your will, and you have resistance to acid damage.

While wearing the gauntlet or using it as a prosthesis, you gain the following properties.

## Absorb Acid

You can use your reaction whenever you take acid damage to reduce the acid damage you take by `dice:2d6+3|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6 + 3`). When you do, the next melee weapon attack you make before the end of your next turn deals extra acid damage equal to the acid damage it reduced.

## Caustic Overdrive

You can use a bonus action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Haste.md\|haste]] spell from the gauntlet. When you do, the spell doesn't require [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]], and you must roll a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) at the end of each of your turns. You take acid damage equal to the result of the `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`), which can't be prevented or reduced in any way. On a 1, the spell ends. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
