# Ice Mint
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Being one of the most invasive species in the world, it is no wonder that mint has managed to find its way into even the most frigid of areas. That said, this mint boasts a magic touch to adapt to its cold environment, housing minor ice power inside that can be imparted to anyone that chews it for long enough.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, your breath is always visible, smells like a refreshing mint, and is cold enough to cause frost to build up on objects you exhale upon.
