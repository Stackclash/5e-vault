# Anathema Device
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This yuan-ti heart is encased in a complicated contraption of copper wires and other mechanical pieces. You may spend your action to activate this contraption, causing it to shock the heart and forcing it to beat. So long as the heart is beating, you emit an aura of fear in a 30-foot radius circle centered on yourself. Any creature of your choice that starts their turn in that circle must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute of any member of your race. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours.

The heart remains beating for 1 minute, or until you drop it from your hand. Once this item has been used once, it cannot be used again for 24 hours.
