^circumstance

When you cast a spell that targets only yourself, you can use a contingency card that you're holding as part of casting it to recreate the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contingency.md\|contingency]] spell from it, using the circumstance that's written on the card as the one required by the spell. The card then ignites and turns to ash, destroying itself. The spell you cast is then only cast once the circumstance comes to pass for the first time within the next 10 days, as per the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contingency.md\|contingency]] spell. This version of contingency doesn't end early as a result of not having a material component.
