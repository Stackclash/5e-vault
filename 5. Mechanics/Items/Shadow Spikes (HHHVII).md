# Shadow Spikes
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

As an action, you can spread this bag of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Caltrops Bag Of 20.md\|caltrops]] to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

When placed in dim light or darkness, these caltrops become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], even to creatures with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]]. This invisibility lasts until they are exposed to bright light, upon which they return to their normal matte black appearance.
