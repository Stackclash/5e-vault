This curved blade was carved from a large viper's fang. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) poison damage. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the start of your next turn. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].
