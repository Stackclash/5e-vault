# Hand Mirror of the Medusa
*Wondrous item, major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Hand-Mirror-of-the-Medusa.webp#right)  


This hand mirror bears the bust of a medusa at its top. Its silver surface is split into thirds by a pair of metal fangs. While holding it, you have advantage on saving throws against becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]], and any creature with the Petrifying Gaze trait that starts its turn within 30 feet of you must also succeed on a saving throw against its own Petrifying Gaze trait. A medusa has disadvantage on the saving throw.

## Petrifying Cone

You can use an action to brandish the mirror in front of you and speak its command word. When you do, you expose it to each creature in a 30-foot cone that originates from you, provided that the creature can see you. Each creature in the area is immediately affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Flesh To Stone.md\|flesh to stone]] spell (save DC 16); you must concentrate on the spell as normal. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the mirror has been used to petrify a creature with its own Petrifying Gaze trait.
