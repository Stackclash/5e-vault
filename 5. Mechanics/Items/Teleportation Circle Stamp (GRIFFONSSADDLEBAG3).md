# Teleportation Circle Stamp
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Teleportation-Circle-Stamp.webp#right)  


This handheld stamp is covered in arcane glyphs. When found, there is a 20 percent chance that it has a sigil sequence for a permanent teleportation circle carved into its wooden base, which has a diameter of 4 inches.

You can carve a miniaturized sigil sequence that you know into the base of the stamp, provided it doesn't have one already. If it does, you can sand it flat and carve a new one instead. Either option takes 1 hour of careful work using a set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Woodcarvers Tools.md\|woodcarver's tools]]. If you're proficient with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Woodcarvers Tools.md\|woodcarver's tools]], it takes 10 minutes of work instead.

While holding the carved stamp, you can use an action to apply a wash of fine inks worth no less than 10 gp onto its carved base. You can then use an action on a following turn within 1 minute to press the inked stamp onto a flat surface within your reach, creating a special teleportation circle at that point that's 4 inches across. The circle remains until the end of your next turn, at which point it flashes with arcane power and disappears.

Any object that's fully within the circle's area is magically teleported to the linked teleportation circle when it disappears. Creatures can't be teleported using this special circle, and any item that creates an extradimensional space, such as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Portable Hole.md\|portable hole]], fails to teleport through the circle when it disappears.
