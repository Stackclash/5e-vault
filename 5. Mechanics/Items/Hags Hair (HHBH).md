# Hag's Hair
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

This long, wispy vine hangs from trees and grows grey, stringy leaves that resemble the hair of an elderly woman. In many societies built near where hag's hair is found, a common belief is that the plant is grown from actual hair left by hags in trees as a means of corrupting the forests and extending their influence. In actual fact, this vine grows on trees that are already blighted and works symbiotically with it to draw out parasites and other diseases which grants it several anti-microbial properties once boiled and drunk.

## Effect:

When you use this herb, you become immune to diseases for the next 24 hours and any disease effects that you are currently subjected to have their progression and symptoms halted.
