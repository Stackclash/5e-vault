# Weirdwater Poison
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Weirdwater-Poison.webp#right)  


This poison rumbles around, sloshing softly within its bottle. It looks, smells, and tastes like water: only a detect poison and disease or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell can determine the nature of the liquid. A creature that drinks this poison in its entirety begins to suffocate, as if by drowning, unless it can breathe underwater. If the creature drops to 0 hit points while drowning in this way, it becomes stable and is no longer drowning; when this happens, a hostile water elemental appears in the nearest unoccupied space. A lesser restoration or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Poison.md\|protection from poison]] spell ends the effect early, allowing the creature to breathe normally once more and preventing the water elemental from appearing.

Alternatively, you can pour the entire vial of poison onto the ground using an action. When you do, a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Water Element(AL).md\|water elemental]] appears in the nearest unoccupied space, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]] spell. The elemental ceases to obey your commands if you fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] or die.

The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Water Element(AL).md\|water elemental]] disappears after 1 hour.
