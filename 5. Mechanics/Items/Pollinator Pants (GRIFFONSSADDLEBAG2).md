# Pollinator Pants
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Pollinator-Pants.webp#right)  


While wearing this pair of black-and-yellow striped pants, any flower you move within 5 feet of magically blossoms, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Druidcraft.md\|druidcraft]] spell.

The pants have 3 charges and regain `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the pants, you can use an action to expend 1 of their charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Plants.md\|speak with plants]] spell from them. This version of the spell only affects plants within the spell's range that have at least one flower on them. When you speak with a plant in this way, you do so by making a combination of somatic gestures and dance-like steps, rather than using your voice. These movements come naturally to you for the duration of the spell and magically convey your message.

## Beekeeper's Commitment

While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the pants regain all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`), and gain the following benefit:

## Sting

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action on each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to make a special unarmed strike against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) piercing damage from the attack. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this unarmed strike, the target takes an extra 10 poison damage from the attack and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of your next turn.
