# Sundersludge Net
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Net.md\|net]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Sundersludge-Net.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Special%20Weapons\|special]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This gelatinous net is made with the enchanted remains of a gray ooze. A creature takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) acid damage when it's [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the net and again at the end of each of its turns while it remains restrained by it. If the creature is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative âˆ’1 penalty to the AC it offers whenever it takes acid damage at the end of one of its turns. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. A creature other than you who touches the net takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) acid damage.

The torn net is harmless. If more than half of the net can be salvaged and stored within a container large enough to hold 1 gallon of liquid for 12 hours, the net is repaired and can be used once more. Your attunement to the net ends if the net remains destroyed for longer than 2 days.

You're immune to damage from the net while you're attuned to it. Picking up the net after throwing it renders it harmless until the next time you throw it. The net deals no acid damage if no creature is attuned to it.

## Special

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. The net's sticky composition makes it more difficult to escape than a mundane one. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has resistance to all damage types. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and tearing the net apart. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
