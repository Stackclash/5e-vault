# Gulthias Staff
*Staff, rare (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/gulthias-staff.webp#right]]  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Twig Blight.md\|blights]] entry of the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 4`) of its expended charges daily at dusk.

If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.

## Vampiric Strike

The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Short Term Madness.md\|short term madness]] (see "[[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Variant Rules/Madness.md\|Madness]]" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

## Blight Bane

While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them.
