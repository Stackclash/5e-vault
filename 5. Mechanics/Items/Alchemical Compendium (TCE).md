# Alchemical Compendium
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

Acrid odors cling to this stained, heavy volume. The book's metal fittings are copper, iron, lead, silver, and gold, some frozen mid-transition from one metal to another. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|enlarge/reduce]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Flesh To Stone.md\|flesh to stone]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gaseous Form.md\|gaseous form]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Weapon.md\|magic weapon]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Polymorph.md\|polymorph]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school.  
- As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original.
