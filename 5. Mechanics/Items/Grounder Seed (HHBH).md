# Grounder Seed
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

Found inside pods of a hardy bush, these seeds contain an oil that dries into a rubbery material shortly after being exposed to air. Its similarity to rubber actually extends to its insulation abilities, and the seed is sought-after as a natural protection against creatures that wield the deadly power of lightning.

## Effect:

You gain resistance to lightning damage for 4 hours after using this herb.
