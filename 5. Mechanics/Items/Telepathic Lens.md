# Telepathic Lens
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This bizarre contraption has a hollowed out mindwitness eye secured by brass wires to a magically imbued lens about the size of a human's head. While looking through this lens, you may telepathically communicate simultaneously to as many creatures as you can see within 120 feet of you.
