# Dead Ringer
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Dead-Ringer.webp#right)  


This bronze mask lets out a deep, sonorous ring when struck. When you're reduced to 0 hit points or fail a death saving throw while wearing the mask, the 3 enemy creatures nearest to you within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:2d12|noform|avg` (`2d12`) necrotic damage. This property has no effect on creatures who aren't missing any hit points or are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]]. If you're healed or stabilized after falling to 0 hit points, the mask can't be used again in this way until the following dusk.
