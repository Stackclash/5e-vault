# Gloom Shield
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Gloom-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This tall shield is made from the sculpted lid of a coffin. A skeletal figure rests embossed on its surface, reminding would-be attackers of their own mortality.

The shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the fear spell from the shield (save DC 15). A creature that fails the saving throw also takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage. Alternatively, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack while you're holding the shield, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield's charges to force that creature to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it immediately takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for until the end of its next turn.
