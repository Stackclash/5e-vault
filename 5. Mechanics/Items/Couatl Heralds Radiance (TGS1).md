# Couatl Herald's Radiance
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster of good alignment)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Couatl-Heralds-Radiance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic wooden staff was enchanted by a powerful [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Couatl.md\|couatl]]. The staff has 5 charges. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spellcasting ability modifier and spell save DC: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Food And Water.md\|create food and water]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cure Wounds.md\|cure wounds]] (2nd-level version), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Poison.md\|protection from poison]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sanctuary.md\|sanctuary]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shield.md\|shield]].

The staff regains `dice:1d3+2|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.

## Flight of the Couatls

While you're attuned to 3 items with this property, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, your flying speed increases by 30 feet instead.
