# Cloak of the Midwinter Solsticekeeper
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Cloak-of-the-Midwinter-Solsticekeeper.webp#right)  


This warm red coat carries a feeling of good tidings and midwinter cheer, even in the most bitter of cold. While wearing it, you have resistance to cold damage, and any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) check you make is made with advantage. The cloak also has the following properties.

## Spells

While wearing the cloak, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it on yourself (save DC 17): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|enlarge/reduce]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Freedom Of Movement.md\|freedom of movement]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md\|invisibility]]. Once a spell has been cast from the cloak, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

## Nimble

While wearing the cloak, you gain a climbing speed of 30 feet, you can move through spaces as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing, and you have advantage on saving throws against traps and other environmental hazards.

## Present

As an action while wearing the cloak, you can flourish the cloak and draw an object from it using a free hand. The object can be any mundane item of your choice from the Adventuring Gear section of the Basic Rules worth no more than 5 gp. If the item is in any way sold or traded for a good or service, it immediately turns to a lump of sulfurous coal. The object remains for 24 hours or until you use this property again. When you remove an object from the cloak in this way, you can choose for it to be plain or wrapped in decorative tissue paper, which magically disappears in a plume of glittering snow after unwrapping. Alternatively, you can use an action to magically wrap an object you're holding with the decorative tissue paper.

## Spirit of Giving

When you give a wrapped item to another creature that suggests an understanding of the other creature's needs, the GM can grant you a special die, called a Giving Die, which is a `dice:d12|noform|avg` (`d12`). You can roll this `dice:d12|noform|avg` (`d12`) and add it to the total of any ability check or saving throw you make (before the GM determines if the roll succeeds or fails), at which point the die is lost. The Giving Die remains until you finish a long rest or until it's lost in this way. Once you gain a Giving Die, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. If the given item was created by the Present property, it remains indefinitely or until it's sold or traded, at which point it turns into a lump of coal.
