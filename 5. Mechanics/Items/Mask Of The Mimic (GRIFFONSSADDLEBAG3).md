# Mask of the Mimic
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mask-of-the-Mimic.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This mask is designed in the likeness of a mimic: the bane (and untimely end) of many adventurers. The mask effortlessly sticks to your face when you put it on. While wearing this mask, mimics are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. Touching or otherwise interacting with a mimic harmlessly reveals its nature to you. In addition, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Disguise Self.md\|disguise self]] spell from the mask at will. The spell ends if the mask is removed.

## Curse

Once you place this mask on your face, you can't remove it unless you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While wearing the mask, you gain the following flaw: "If I see something of value that I think I can steal, it only makes sense to try."
