# Cap of Aggression
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this cap, you may spend your bonus action to designate a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see and that has blood in their body as your quarry. As part of your [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, you may choose to move up to your speed in the direction of your quarry. In addition, the first successful melee weapon attack you make against your quarry on your turn deals an extra damage dice of damage, and the same applies to your quarry's first successful melee weapon attack against you on their turn.

You may only have one quarry at a time and any attempt at designating a new target as your quarry while you already have a quarry automatically fails. A target remains your quarry until you bathe this cap in fresh blood from their corpse for at least 1 minute or if 24 hours pass since you last designated a quarry.
