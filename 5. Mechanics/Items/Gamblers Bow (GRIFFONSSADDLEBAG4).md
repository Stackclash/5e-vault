# Gambler's Bow
*Rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Gamblers-Bow.webp#right)  


A red gaming die sits at each end of this bow's string. When you make a ranged attack roll with the bow, you can use a bonus action to magically give yourself advantage on the roll. If you roll the same number on both d20s, the attack is a critical hit. If you roll a 1 on any of the dice or if the attack misses, the next attack you make before the end of your next turn is made with disadvantage.
