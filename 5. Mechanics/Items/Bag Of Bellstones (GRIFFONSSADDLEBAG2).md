# Bag of Bellstones
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bag-of-Bellstones.webp#right)  


This cloth bag shines like brass and can hold up to 20 small stones. When found, the bag has `dice:1d12+8|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d12 + 8`) stones inside. When you remove a stone that's been in the bag for at least 1 minute, it becomes magical until the end of the turn, if it isn't already. While a stone is magical in this way, it emits a clear, bell-like ringing that's audible out to a range of 60 feet whenever it hits a target or touches an object or surface.
