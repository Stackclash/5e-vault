# Floating Tablecloth
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Floating-Tablecloth.webp#right)  


This silk tablecloth flutters dramatically when held aloft. You can use an action to shake the cloth open with a flourish and set it on an imaginary table. When you do, you cast the floating disk spell from the cloth, which hangs suspended on the disk. This version of the spell can hold up to 100 pounds. The disk remains until too much weight is placed on it or until a creature uses an action to remove the tablecloth. When the spell ends, the cloth crumples to the ground.
