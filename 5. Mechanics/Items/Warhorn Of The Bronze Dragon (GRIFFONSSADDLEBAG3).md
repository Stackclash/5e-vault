# Warhorn of the Bronze Dragon
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Warhorn-of-the-Bronze-Dragon.webp#right)  


This warhorn is made from the tip of a bronze dragon's horn and decorated with an elaborate, draconic maw at its end. You can use an action to blow the horn and release an ear-splitting roar that is audible 600 feet away. When this happens, you can choose to cause the horn to release one of the draconic breaths from the options below:

## Lightning Breath

The horn releases a wave of electrified power in a 30-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Repulsion Breath

The horn releases a wave of repelling force in a 30-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed up to 30 feet away from you.

Once a breath has been used, that breath can't be used again until the next dawn.
