![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Frozen-Dagger.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 cold
- **Range**: 40/80
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]

Attacks made with this dagger deal cold damage instead of piercing. If you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn, frozen in place and unable to move. If it succeeds, its movement speed is halved until the end of its next turn instead.
