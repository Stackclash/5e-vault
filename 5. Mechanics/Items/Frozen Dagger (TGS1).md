- **Damage**: 1d4 C
- **Range**: 40/80

Attacks made with this dagger deal cold damage instead of piercing. If you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn, frozen in place and unable to move. If it succeeds, its movement speed is halved until the end of its next turn instead.
