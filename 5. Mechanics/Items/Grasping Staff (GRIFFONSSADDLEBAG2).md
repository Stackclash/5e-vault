# Grasping Staff
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), spellcasting focus, major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Grasping-Staff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This grotesquely carved stone staff is miraculously light but deathly cold and clammy to the touch. You have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bigbys Hand.md\|arcane hand]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|inflict wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mage Hand.md\|mage hand]] (no charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] (3 charges).

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff turns to ash and summons `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) hostile tiny undead [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Crawling Claw.md\|crawling hands]] within 10 feet of you.
