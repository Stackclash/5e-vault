# Harpy Ink
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This bright pink pot of ink is imbued with magical properties that charm those that read messages written in it. Once this ink is used to write a message, the ink changes to an ordinary black colour. The first creature that reads the message must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] for 24 hours. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, that creature wholeheartedly believes everything they read in that message, so long as the message is within the realm of plausibility. At the end of this 24 hours, the charm effect ends, and the creature realises it has been [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]]. This pot contains enough ink to write 400 words.
