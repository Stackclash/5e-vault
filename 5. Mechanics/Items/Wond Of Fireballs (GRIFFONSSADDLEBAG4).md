# Wond of Fireballs
*Wand, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Wond-of-Fireballs.webp#right)  


This wand functions as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of Fireballs.md\|wand of fireballs]]. However, during the wand's creation, the spell's transcription was riddled with arcane mistakes. As a result, using an action to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] from the wand can lead to unpredictable outcomes.

Whenever you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] spell from the wand, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) and use the table below to determine the spell's effect. Regardless of the outcome, the spell's effect is centered on the point you target with the wand and uses a save DC of 15. If the wand casts a different spell, any extra charges spent as part of using the wand increase the spell slot level of the new spell as well.

`dice: [[Wond Of Fireballs (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG4).md#^effect]]`

| dice: d20 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1–4 | Wireball. You cast the flaming sphere spell. This version of the spell creates a tightly-wound sphere of ragged, spinning wire. On a hit, the sphere deals piercing damage instead of fire damage. When cast in this way, the spell doesn't immediately require your concentration; if you don't choose to begin concentrating on the spell at the end of the turn you cast it, the spell ends early. |
| 5–8 | Firebull. You summon a Large bull in the nearest unoccupied space to the targeted point. Use the giant boar's statistics for the bull, except that the bull is made of pure fire and is an elemental instead of a beast. The bull takes its turn on initiative count 20, and it always attacks the creature closest to it on each of its turns. On a hit, the bull deals fire damage, instead of its normal type. A creature that touches the bull or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. The bull remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. You summon two bulls at the location when you cast the spell with 4 or 5 charges, or three bulls when you cast it with 6 or 7. The additional bulls appear in the nearest unoccupied spaces to the first bull. |
| 9–12 | Firefall. You cast the ice storm spell instead. This version of the spell creates falling, flaming rocks instead of hail, and deals fire damage instead of cold damage. |
| 13–16 | Fiveball. You cast five smaller fireballs, which detonate at five different points of your choice within 20 feet of the original one. Each smaller fireball has an explosion radius of 5 feet. A creature in the area of more than one of these fireballs is affected only once. |
| 17–20 | You cast the fireball spell as normal. |
^effect

The wand has 7 charges. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand casts [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]], centered on you, and is destroyed.
