Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Nature\|Nature]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Religion\|Religion]], and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]] skills if you were not proficient in them before. This effect lasts for 24 hours, after which you suffer 2 levels of [[/5.

This potion is a dull grey color with chunks of partly solidified matter floating in it.
