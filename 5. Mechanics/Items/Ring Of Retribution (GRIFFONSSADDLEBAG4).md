*Ring, rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Ring-of-Retribution.webp#right)  


This tarnished iron ring bears a dark pearl at its center. One side of the ring depicts a hellish knight, while the other an angelic priest. While wearing the ring, any armor you wear glimmers with a slight pearlescence. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this ring, and whenever you would deal fire or radiant damage, you can change the damage type to radiant or fire, respectively. In addition, you gain the following option for your Channel Divinity feature:

## Wrathful Ward

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to present the ring of retribution and cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Evil And Good.md\|protection from evil and good]] spell from it, targeting yourself only. For the duration, when a creature affected by the spell hits you with an attack, it automatically takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage.
