# Serpent Dart
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Dart.md\|dart]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Serpent-Dart.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]

You can use an action to cause thick, emerald green poison to coat this magic dart. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take an extra `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage from the attack and become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
