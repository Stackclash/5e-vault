# Helm of the Horned King
*Wondrous Item, artifact, Crafted Artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20Artifact\|Crafted Artifact]]

The Helm of the Horned King is an item often seen in the deranged paintings made by demonic cultists. Formed from the head of the Horned King, [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Baphomet.md\|Baphomet]], this helm is said to be worn during the end of all things; an apocalyptic badge of office awarded to the being who will unite the disparate factions of the Abyss, defeat the armies of the Nine Hells, and tear down the heavens themselves to allow chaos to reign.

The helm itself is composed of a magically imbued steel that is virtually unbreakable and is covered with dark, shaggy fur. Two antlers with three prongs each grow from the top; each one is supernaturally sharp and capable of puncturing even the hardest bedrock.

In order to attune to the helm, a creature must wear it while stalking and hunting a large beast such as a stag or bear under a moonless night. Upon killing their quarry, the wearer must then remove the head of their prey and drip the blood onto their own head. This finalizes the attunement which causes the helm to fuse to the skull of the wearer, transforming their head into one that resembles that of a black minotaur. As part of this, the wearer gains the ability to use the horns as natural weapons to make unarmed strikes. If it hits, this attack deals piercing damage equal to `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) + your Strength modifier. If you moved at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before attacking with your horns, you deal an additional `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) damage to your target.

## Random Properties

The Helm of the Horned King has the following random properties:

- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial]] properties  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] property  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Detrimental Properties.md\|major detrimental]] property  

## Demonic Protection

You gain a +2 bonus to your AC and have resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage. In addition, you are immune to poisons and disease.

## Spellcasting

Using this helm, you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Beast.md\|dominate beast]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hunters Mark.md\|hunter's mark]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Maze.md\|maze]] spells once a day. All casting of these spells are done at their lowest level. If you are attuned to the the weapon [[5. Mechanics/Items/Heartcleaver.md\|Heartcleaver]], you may cast these spells one level higher than their lowest and you also gain the ability to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Teleport.md\|teleport]] spell once. All uses of spells are recovered upon the next dawn.

## Apex Predator

Creatures, and especially beasts, naturally revere you as the dominant hunter and predator in the vicinity. As part of this, you gain the following abilities:

- You have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) checks against all other creatures.  
- You have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks made to track other creatures, and magical illusions cannot obfuscate your senses when attempting to follow a creature's trail.  
- Whenever you kill a creature, you may designate all creatures of that creature's type as your prey for the next hour. Anytime a creature of that type that you can see attempts to move in a direction away from you, you may use your reaction to move up to your speed towards them and make a melee weapon attack against them if they are within your reach.  

## Territorial Ruler

If you spend 1 hour focusing while standing in one spot, you may declare a 5-mile area around you your lair so long as it is not already the lair of another living creature. Over the course of `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) days the following effects begin to take place in your lair:

- Plant life within your lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes. You are innately aware of the layout of this maze and cannot be lost in it.  
- All beasts within your lair become frightened and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within your lair, that humanoid must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Baphomet.md\|Madness of Baphomet table]]* ^[See the info tab]. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

## Pack Leader

All allied creatures within 150 feet of you that are aware of you are considered part of your pack. Any creature that is part of your pack has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls against any creature that is adjacent to another member of the pack. In addition, whenever a member of your pack reduces a creature's HP to 0, you may use your reaction to allow them to move up to their speed towards a hostile creature.

## Curse:

When you become attuned to the helm, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Baphomet.md\|Madness of Baphomet table]]* ^[See the info tab] and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Helm

This helm can only be destroyed if the creature wearing and attuned to it is killed by the weapon The [[5. Mechanics/Items/Butcher.md\|Butcher]]. At this point, the helm will crumble to dust and become useless.
