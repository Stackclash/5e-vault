- **Damage**: 1d10 P
- **Range**: 150/600
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magic ivory bow is sculpted to look like a pair of curved unicorn horns and is strung with the finely braided hair of a pegasus' mane. This bow's damage die is a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) instead of a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`).

The bow has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

## Flight

While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cause small wings to appear on your feet that last until the end of your turn. For the duration, you have a flying speed of 90 feet. While the wings remain, you can choose to expend another charge from the bow at the end of each of your turns (no action required) to extend the wings' duration until the end of your next turn.

## Healing Horn

While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to fire a magical arrow of pure light at a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you, causing that creature to regain `dice:2d6+2|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 2`) hit points.

## Trampling Arrow

When you make a ranged attack with the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the fired arrow to transform into a spectral, charging pegasus. On a hit, the target takes an extra `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) force damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. If the target of the attack is already [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]], you ignore the normal disadvantage imposed on ranged attack rolls against [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] creatures and make the roll with advantage instead.
