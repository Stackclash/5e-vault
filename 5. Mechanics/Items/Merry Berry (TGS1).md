# Merry Berry
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Merry-Berry.webp#right)  


This small fruit is highly sought after by cooks and sweet-lovers everywhere, both for its flavor as well as its unique sensory-enhancing properties. Eating a berry raw yields a taste and texture like that of a rich shortbread: the perfect way to end a day of adventure or travel.

Cooking the berry, whether it be in a cuisine or simply roasted over a campfire, brings out more uncommon effects. When properly cooked, a creature that eats the fruit gains advantage on all Wisdom and Intelligence checks based on smell or taste for the next 24 hours, as well as advantage on ability checks using [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cooks Utensils.md\|cook's utensils]].

Overcooking the fruit not only cooks out the berry's benefits, but also results in a soggy and overall bland dish.
