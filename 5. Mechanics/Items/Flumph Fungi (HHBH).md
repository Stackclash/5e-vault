# Flumph Fungi
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

Featuring two small bulbs growing from the top of its flat, wide cap, this mushroom resembles the creatures of its namesake. Adding onto the fact that when ingested they enhance a creature's ability to empathise with those around them, a popular theory among herbalists is that these fungi are formed when the ephemeral flumph dissipates and its essence coalesces in areas of great emotional significance.

## Effect:

After using this herb, you gain a greater awareness and empathy for the people around you for the next 4 hours. During this time, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) checks to ascertain the emotional state of humanoids you interact with.
