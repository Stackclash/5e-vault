# Squirtwort
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

Squirtwort is a series of bud-like plants connected by a stringy stem. Although it grows beneath the sands of a beach, they can be found easily by looking for the telltale jets of water that they squirt a few inches above the surface whenever the tide washes over them. This herb is quite ubiquitous, and during low tide, it is mesmerising to see the coast erupt with miniature geysers, almost as if the beach itself is breathing. Incidentally, the internal mechanism they use to squirt the water out also mixes it with an oily discharge that has been harvested by coastal cultures as both a lubricant, and mild intoxicant.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) buds. As an action, you may throw one of these buds at a point on the ground within 30 feet of you, bursting the bud upon contact. After bursting, a bud releases a fountain of slippery fluid that covers a 5-foot square area around it. Any creature that enters the covered area must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].
