# Staff of Charming
*Staff, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Requires%20Attunement|Requires Attunement]], [[5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast [[/5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Person.md|charm person]], [[/5. Mechanics/Spells/Command.md|command]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Spells/Comprehend Languages.md|comprehend languages]] from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.

If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

The staff regains `dice: 1d8 + 2` (`1d8 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
