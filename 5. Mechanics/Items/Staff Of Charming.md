# Staff of Charming
*Staff, weapon, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/staff-of-charming.webp#right]]  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Person.md\|charm person]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Command.md\|command]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Comprehend Languages.md\|comprehend languages]] from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.

If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

The staff regains `dice:1d8+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
