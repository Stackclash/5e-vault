![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Knights-Standard-of-Virtue.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While wielding this decorated glaive, you radiate righteousness. You and other friendly creatures within 10 feet of you are considered proficient in saving throws made to resist becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]]. In addition, when a friendly creature you can see within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically reduce the damage they take by up to 5. When you do, you take force damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced in this way.

You can concentrate on the weapon's flag over the course of a short rest to change its design and color.
