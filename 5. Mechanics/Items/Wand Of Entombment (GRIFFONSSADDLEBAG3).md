# Wand of Entombment
*Wand, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wand-of-Entombment.webp#right)  


This wand's bone handle is connected to a large coffin nail by a rigid chain. The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

## Detect Undead

You can use an action to hold the wand out in front of you and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, the wand's chain goes slack, and remains slack for 1 hour or until you end the effect using a bonus action. For the duration, the nail magically levitates and points in the direction of the nearest undead creature within 120 feet of you. If you use any of the wand's other properties while its chain is slack, it snaps back to normal for as long as it takes to use that property.

## Disintegrate

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 4 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Disintegrate.md\|disintegrate]] spell from it (save DC 15).

## Entombing Nail

While holding the wand, you can use an action to send out two nails of pure necrotic energy, targeting a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each nail against the target, using a spell attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage, and its speed is reduced by 5 feet for 1 minute. If this attack reduces a creature's speed to 0 feet, it can't speak for the duration. An affected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the effects of any nail on it ends. You can send out additional nails by expending 1 or more charges as part of using this property, sending out one additional nail for each charge you expend. This penalty to speed is cumulative.
