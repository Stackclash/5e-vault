# Quake Hammer
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Light Hammer.md\|light hammer]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Quake-Hammer.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 B
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

As an action, you can smash this hammer into the ground to send out intense tremors. Other creatures within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or suffer `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. Creatures who succeed on the throw take half as much damage and do not fall prone. You can cause this effect while you hold the hammer or when you throw it, creating the tremors at the point on the ground that the hammer lands.

The save DC for this effect is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
