# Snap Tongue Attachment
*Generic Variant, very rare*  


This attachment takes the form of a 1-inch diameter filament; one end is designed to attach to the handle of a weapon, while the other has a leather hoop designed to be wrapped around a hand. This attachment allows the holder of the leather hoop to exercise an extreme amount of control over their weapon through the filament. A weapon that has had this item attached to it gains the reach property so long as you have the leather hoop in your hand. This item may not be attached to a weapon that has the range, two-handed, or special properties. It takes 1 minute to attach this filament to a weapon and takes 1 action to remove it. Wrapping the leather hoop around your hand requires an action.
