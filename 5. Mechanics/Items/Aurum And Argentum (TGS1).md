This gold and silver set of daggers seem ordinary when used on their own, but become magical when used together. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these daggers while you hold one of them in each hand. When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these daggers, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

In addition, if you hit the same target with both daggers in the same round, it takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) piercing damage from the second attack and can't use its reaction until the end of your turn.
