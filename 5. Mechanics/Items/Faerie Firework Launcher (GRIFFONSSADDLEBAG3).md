# Faerie Firework Launcher
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Faerie-Firework-Launcher.webp#right)  


This crossbow's wood shifts from golden yellows to vibrant reds and has a dimly lit fuse at its top. It has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon's charges once on each of your turns when you make a ranged attack roll with it. When you do, the bolt sizzles and sparks with festive colors, and whistles loudly as it flies through the air. On a hit, the target takes an extra `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage. Hit or miss, the bolt then explodes in an eruption of magical fireworks. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) fire damage and be under the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Faerie Fire.md\|faerie fire]] spell until the start of your next turn (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] required). The whistling bolt and firework's explosion can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. The bolt is then destroyed, provided it wasn't magical.
