# Dragon Turtle Gumbo
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Dragon-Turtle-Gumbo.webp#right)  


This spicy dish is made with dragon turtle meat and an assortment of flavorful herbs and vegetables that enrich its savory broth. It takes 1 minute to eat. Once you've eaten the gumbo, you can breathe underwater for 8 hours.

For the same duration, you can use an action to summon forth the heat and power of a dragon turtle, exhaling a scalding wave of steam and spice in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage. Once you exhale in this way three times, you can't do so again for the rest of the duration.
