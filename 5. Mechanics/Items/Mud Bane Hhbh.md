# Mud Bane
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

A rather ordinary looking plant of scraggly leaves and thin stalks jutting out from the mud. While the leaves themselves actually make for a decent piece of forage, the buried roots of the plant are highly toxic and should be avoided at all costs. While the root may resemble a rather enticingly plump radish, a single bite of it can result in seizures and convulsions and possibly even death. Unfortunately, many animals and inexperienced adventurers fall prey to this plant every year, resulting in the ominous visuals of corpses piling up in the mud wherever this plant spreads.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d3|avg` (`1d3`) charges. To use this herb, you must expend one charge to cover one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition in a toxic sap. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit by this weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw failed by 5 or more, the creature is also incapacitated as they become consumed by violent seizures. At the start of each of their turns and anytime they take damage, the creature may make the saving throw again. On a success, they are no longerincapacitated.
