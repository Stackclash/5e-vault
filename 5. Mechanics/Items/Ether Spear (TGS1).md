# Ether Spear
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spear]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ether-Spear.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 force
  - Two-handed: 1d8 force
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This spear can slip through the Ethereal Plane to reach its destination. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals force damage instead of piercing. When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action with the spear, you can choose a point you can see within 20 feet of you. The tip of the spear vanishes and reappears at that point, allowing you to make melee attacks with the spear against a creature in or adjacent to that space until the end of your turn. You ignore half cover with these attacks and treat three-quarters cover as if it were half cover.

You can use a bonus action to see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. Once this property of the spear has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
