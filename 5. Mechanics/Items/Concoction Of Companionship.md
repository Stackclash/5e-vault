# Concoction of Companionship
*Potion, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This gray potion is divided into two layers that never mix: a cloudy top half, and a clear bottom half. As an action, you may drink the cloudy half, allowing another creature to drink the clear half. For the next 7 days, whoever drank the cloudy half is considered the "guardian" and the drinker of the clear half is considered the "charge" as both of you gain a psychic connection with one another. If one creature drinks both halves or if no creature drinks the second half within 1 minute of the first, the magic of this potion fades and it becomes useless.

Guardians and charges may communicate telepathically over any distance and are always aware of each other's location, direction, and distance from each other, so long as they are on the same plane of existence as each other. If a creature within the guardian's reach damages their charge, they may spend their reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the damaging creature. This attack is made with advantage. In addition, if a charge starts their turn with 0 hit points while within 60 feet of their guardian, they instantly stabilize.
