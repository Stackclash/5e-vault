*Potion, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you become comfortable even if you are in extreme weather. For the next 24 hours, you automatically succeed any saving throw against [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] triggered by being in an extremely cold or an extremely hot environment. This potion is constantly bubbling as if boiling and also has a small shard of ice in it that never melts despite the ambient temperature.
