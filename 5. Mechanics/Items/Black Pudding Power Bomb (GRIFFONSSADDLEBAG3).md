# Black Pudding Power Bomb
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Black-Pudding-Power-Bomb.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This magic iron bomb is the size of a large fist and weighs 6 pounds. A black, sticky ooze has partially leaked from the bomb's top. Holding the bomb and touching the ooze for longer than a few seconds begins to numb your hand.

You can use an action to throw the bomb at a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. Its cap splits open upon impact, releasing a blast of electricity from it in a 20-foot-radius sphere and allowing its contents to spill out. The bomb is then destroyed. Each creature within the area of the electric blast must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after the blast, two Medium [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Black Pudding.md\|black pudding]]s appear in the nearest unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the point of impact. Each Medium pudding's hit point maximum is half of a normal Large one's (rounded down). The puddings are hostile to all creatures except each other, and they remain until reduced to 0 hit points.
