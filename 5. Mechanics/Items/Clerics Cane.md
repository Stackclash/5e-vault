# Cleric's Cane
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A variety of citrullus, cleric's staff is a dull, green-brown in colour with a woody texture on the curled, cane-like vines that give the plant its name. These vines have strong medicinal properties when chewed, and act as a natural boost to the body's recovery process. Do not eat the gourds that the vines are connected to however, they are incredibly bitter and have been known to lead to respiratory problems for many people.

## Effect:

As part of using this herb, you may roll any number of hit die you have available to regain hit points as you would normally during a short rest. If you roll a 1 or 2 on any of those die, you may reroll the result and must take the new number, even if it is a 1 or a 2.
