# Second Fiddle
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Second-Fiddle.webp#right)  


A hand-me-down fiddle that's been enchanted over time by the sheer number of bards to have played it. You have a +3 bonus to Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) checks made with this fiddle. In addition, if you're a bard and are holding the fiddle when a creature other than you who can see and hear you rolls a Bardic Inspiration die, you can use your reaction to play a magical note on the fiddle. When you do, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again and choose either result. You can use this reaction before or after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
