# Peony of Power
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

This highly-sought after flower is not actually a distinct species of flower, but rather a regular peony that has absorbed latent magical energy from its environment. As such, this peony is unbreedable since its existence relies entirely upon the random whims of fateâ€”a fact that is highly disappointing to mages due to the flower's ability to grant them a temporary, but powerful, surge in arcane abilities.

## Effect:

As an action, you may crush this herb in your hand. For the next 10 minutes, anytime you [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Cast%20a%20Spell\|cast a spell]] that expends a spell slot, it is considered to be cast using a spell slot that is 1 level higher than the one you actually used.
