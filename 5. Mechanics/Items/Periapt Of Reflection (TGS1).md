# Periapt of Reflection
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Periapt-of-Reflection.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This perfectly reflective charm magically helps you meditate and focus your mind. While wearing the necklace, you can use your reaction to reroll any Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw that you fail. You must use the new result.

## Curse

This curse is only revealed and extended to you when you roll a 1 on a saving throw after using the periapt to reroll it. While you're cursed, the mirrored surface of the necklace dulls into an ugly, flat gray while you wear it. The curse persists even if you are not wearing the necklace, and you remain cursed until targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic.

While you're cursed, your reflection in any mirrored surface within 10 feet of you turns into an ugly, horrifying visage of your deepest insecurities. In addition, when you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw (including the roll that reveals this curse), you take `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) psychic damage.
