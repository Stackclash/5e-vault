# Mummy Lord Staff
*Staff, weapon, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mummy-Lord-Staff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff is wrapped in old mummy wrappings salvaged from an unknown burial ground. Its sinewy haft is made from a flesh-colored wood. It can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

## Charges

The staff has 10 charges. It regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff is destroyed and turns to dust.

## Spells

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blight.md\|blight]] (4 charges) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Enfeeblement.md\|ray of enfeeblement]] (2 charges) from it, using your spell attack bonus and spell save DC. Alternatively, you can expend 3 or more of the staff's charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]] spell from it, using your spell save DC. For 3 charges, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend, up to 7th level.

## Rotting Touch

Once per turn when you hit a creature with the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) necrotic damage to the target. Until it finishes a long rest, that target's hit point maximum is reduced by the amount of necrotic damage dealt by this property. If the target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 in this way, it dies, and its body is turned to dust.

## Curse

This staff is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. You remain cursed until you're targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While cursed, your hit point maximum is reduced by `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) each time you drop to 0 hit points. If your hit point maximum is reduced to 0 in this way, you die, and your body is turned to dust. Your hit point maximum remains reduced in this way until you're targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell, even if the curse on you ends.
