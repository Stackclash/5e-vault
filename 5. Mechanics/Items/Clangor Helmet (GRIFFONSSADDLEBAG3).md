- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This helmet was made from a temple bell and weighs 10 pounds. While wearing it, you have resistance to thunder damage and can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]]. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you deals bludgeoning damage to you with a melee attack, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 5 or 6, the attacking creature takes 5 or 6 thunder damage, respectively.
