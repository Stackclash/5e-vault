# Staff of the Iron Cauldron
*Staff, weapon, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Staff-of-the-Iron-Cauldron.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This iron staff has a thorny cauldron mounted at its head, which belches a noxious fume from its mouth. Grass and similarly Tiny mundane plants wither when its twisted end is planted on them. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it is always under the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shillelagh.md\|shillelagh]] spell.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: acid arrow (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Antilife Shell.md\|antilife shell]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blight.md\|blight]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Grease.md\|grease]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Poison Spray.md\|poison spray]] (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stinking Cloud.md\|stinking cloud]] (3 charges).

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff explodes into smoke and all plant life within 500 feet flourishes.
