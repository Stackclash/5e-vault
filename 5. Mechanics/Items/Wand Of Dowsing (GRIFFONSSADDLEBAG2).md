# Wand of Dowsing
*Wand, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wand-of-Dowsing.webp#right)  


This hazel wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Locate Object.md\|locate object]] spell from it. When the wand is used to detect water, its range increases to 10 miles.

The wand regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand bursts into a small cloud of harmless steam.
