This dagger continually radiates a wave of cold that intensifies when sunk into exposed flesh. You have a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and when you deal damage with it, you may choose to convert the piercing damage into frost ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: cold] damage instead.
