# Grave Root
*Herb, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHbH/GraveRoot.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A dry, grey root that grows only on dark sites of death and misery. While it may seem like these conditions would make for a wicked plant, the opposite actually holds true: they are in fact omens of good luck and wards against malicious forces that would attempt to disturb the dead upon which they grow. That should not stop you from picking some of them yourself however, as a powder made from these roots makes for a fine defence against necrotic magics.

## Effect:

You gain resistance to necrotic damage for 4 hours after using this herb.
