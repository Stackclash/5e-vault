# Crystal Ball of Telepathy
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]] is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] spell (save DC 17) with it.

While [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]], you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Suggestion.md\|suggestion]] spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]] can't be used again until the next dawn.
