# Bardic Leathers
*Light armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Studded Leather Armor.md\|studded leather armor]]), very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Bardic-Leathers.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + Dex modifier
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

This armor has strands of spun mithral strung between its various studs, adding extra protection and allowing you to play it like a worn instrument. Even if you're not attuned to the armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC while wearing it, and if you're proficient with lutes or lyres, you add your proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve playing the bardic leathers as an instrument.

If you're attuned to the armor and have a free hand, you can use your reaction when you're hit by an attack to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, using your hand to pluck one of the armor's strings. When you do, you can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the result to your AC, potentially causing the triggering attack to miss.
