This staff has 6 charges, one for each of the white snake heads on its top. While holding this staff, if you target a creature with a spell that would result in them being charmed, you may spend a charge to target an additional creature within 10 feet of the original creature, subjecting them to the same spell. You may spend additional charges to repeat this effect, so long as each additional creature is within 10 feet of another targeted creature.

This staff regains all lost charges at dawn.
