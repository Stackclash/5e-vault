This large axe has felled thousands of trees since its creation, giving it a ring-like pattern on its blade and a unique enchantment. As an action, you can speak the axe's command word and swing it to cause a large, spectral tree to fall down in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. The spectral tree vanishes immediately after the effect. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the axe can still be used as a magic weapon.

In addition, you have advantage on any ability check you make to cut down a tree when you're using the axe to chop it down.
