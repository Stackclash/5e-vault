# Bottled Yawn
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Bottled-Yawn.webp#right)  


A yawn has been magically captured within this bottle. Opening or shattering the bottle (such as by throwing it) releases the yawn, forcing any creature within 5 feet of the bottle to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes drowsy. A drowsy creature takes a -2 penalty to AC, and its speed is halved. At the end of a drowsy creature's turn, it must make another DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls asleep and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]]. On a success, the creature is no longer drowsy.

A sleeping creature is no longer drowsy. It remains asleep for 10 minutes, until the sleeper takes damage, or until someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Once the yawn is released, the bottle itself becomes nonmagical, and the yawn is lost.
