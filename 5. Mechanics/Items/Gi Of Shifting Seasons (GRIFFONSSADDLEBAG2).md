# Gi of Shifting Seasons
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a monk)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Gi-of-Shifting-Seasons.webp#right)  


When found, this gi is gray with a large tree design at its bottom hem. When you attune to the gi, its color and tree design changes to resemble the current season: Winter (blue, leafless), Spring (green, pink blossoms), Summer (red, green leaves), or Autumn (Yellow, red leaves along the bottom hem). While the gi resembles a season, it gains the following respective benefits:

## Winter

You are immune to the effects of extreme cold, and whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, that creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum speed of 15 feet) until the start of your next turn.

## Spring

When the gi changes to this season, you gain `dice:1d4+4|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 4`) temporary hit points. In addition, when you use your Step of the Wind, your jump distance is tripled, instead of doubled, and you ignore the effects of difficult terrain until the end of your turn.

## Summer

You are immune to the effects of extreme heat, and whenever you hit a target with an unarmed strike, the target takes an additional 2 fire damage. If you are outside during the day, the target takes an additional 3 fire damage, instead.

## Autumn

You have advantage on Constitution saving throws. When you use your Patient Defense, creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move within 5 feet of you until the start of your next turn.

You can change the gi's season to another one of your choice by spending 1 minute in silent meditation. Alternatively, whenever you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to spend 1 or more ki points, you can choose to shift the gi's season by one, moving in chronological order. When you do, you choose whether to gain the season's benefits before or after the action. For example, if the gi is in Autumn and you spend 1 ki point to use Flurry of Blows, the gi can immediately change to represent Winter and grant the season's benefits to your Flurry of Blows.
