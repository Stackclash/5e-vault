This [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Sword Wraith Warrior (MPMM).md\|sword wraith warrior]] takes its turn immediately after you on the same initiative count. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Sword Wraith Warrior (MPMM).md\|sword wraith warrior]] follows your commands to the best of its ability or attempts to fight the nearest creature hostile to you if no command is given. A [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Sword Wraith Warrior (MPMM).md\|sword wraith warrior]] summoned in this way disappears completely once your next turn ends, or if it drops to 0 hit points. A [[5.
