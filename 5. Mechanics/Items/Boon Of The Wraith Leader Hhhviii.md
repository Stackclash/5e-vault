# Boon of the Wraith Leader
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

Whenever you score a critical hit on a weapon attack against a creature, you may use your reaction to summon a sword wraith warrior [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (your DM has the statblock)] in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This sword wraith warrior takes its turn immediately after you on the same initiative count. The sword wraith warrior follows your commands to the best of its ability or attempts to fight the nearest creature hostile to you if no command is given. A sword wraith warrior summoned in this way disappears completely once your next turn ends, or if it drops to 0 hit points. A sword wraith warrior summoned in this way cannot be harvested.
