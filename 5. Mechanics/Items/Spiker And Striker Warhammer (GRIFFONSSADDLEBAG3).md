This warhammer and nail-like dagger share a magical bond. Despite being a pair of weapons, they are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons. While wielding only the warhammer or both it and the dagger in either hand, the warhammer also has the light property.

When you hit a target with Spiker (the dagger), you can choose to leave the weapon embedded in the target. The first time you hit that target using Striker (the warhammer) while the dagger is embedded in it, the target takes an extra `dice:1d12|noform|noparens|avg` (`d12`) piercing damage from the attack. The dagger then magically returns to your hand. It returns early if you don't deal this extra damage before the end of your next turn or if a creature uses an action to remove it from the target. If you don't have a free hand when Spiker returns to you, it lands at your feet instead.
