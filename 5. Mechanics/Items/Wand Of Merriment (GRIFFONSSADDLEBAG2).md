# Wand of Merriment
*Wand, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wand-of-Merriment.webp#right)  


This wand is made from a sprig of holly and exudes an unmistakable aura of cheer from it. It has 10 holly berries that each contain 1 charge and are used to fuel the wand's properties. When you expend a charge from a berry, it wilts away and disappears. The wand regrows `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) missing berries daily at dawn. While you're attuned to the wand, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma checks and saving throws.

## Spells

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16) from it: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Food And Water.md\|create food and water]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Goodberry.md\|goodberry]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Tashas Hideous Laughter.md\|hideous laughter]] (1 charge), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ottos Irresistible Dance.md\|irresistible dance]] (6 charges).

## Dashing through the Snow

While holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 of its charges to take the Dash action. When you do, you ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

## Festive

As an action, you can wave this wand over up to 1 gallon of water and expend 1 charge to transform the liquid into a weak, but pleasant-tasting, alcoholic beverage.

If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, all but one of the wand's leaves and berry stems wither away and die. When this happens, the wand becomes a common wand that does not require attunement, but has only 1 charge. This common version of the wand retains only the festive property of its original form and regains the expended charge daily at dawn.
