# Kraken Paint
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

A pot of this black paint is enough to cover up to 100 square feet of material. An enclosed space that has had its interior surface covered entirely in kraken paint acts as it were permanently under the effect of the darkness spell.

You may also spill the entire pot of paint into a body of water as an action to create a 60-foot radius cloud that spreads around corners. This area is considered heavily obscured and each creature that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d10|avg` (`3d10`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of your next turn.
