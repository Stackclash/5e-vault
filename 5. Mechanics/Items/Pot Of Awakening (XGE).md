# Pot of Awakening
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  


If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Awakened Shrub.md\|awakened shrub]] at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.

The awakened shrub is friendly toward you. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.
