# Essence of Rage
*Potion, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Essence-of-Rage.webp#right)  


This swirling potion tastes like iron and bitter raisins. When you drink this potion, you enter a [rage](compendium/classes/barbarian.md#Rage%20(Level%201)) that lasts for 1 minute or until you're knocked unconscious. This rage grants you the same effects as the barbarian's class feature at 1st level with the following additional properties:

- If you end your turn without having attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn, your rage does not end, but you take `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) psychic damage instead.  
- You can enter this rage even if you're wearing heavy armor.  

In addition, when you use your action to drink this potion, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
