# Whisper Puff
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

From a distance, the fluffy, white heads of the whisper puff may make them seem like cotton. However, upon closer inspection, one can find a faint glow of magic radiating from each fibre, giving it the appearance of a small halo. The magic inherent in the whisper puff gives it a strange property that allows it to channel the flow of magic, but only when in close proximity to the source. Functionally, this has led to mages to stuff wads of this plant's fibres into their mouths in order to cast verbal-based spells without having to actually speak in anything but an inaudible whisper, an ability perfectly suited for secret sorcery. Incidentally, this usage is the origin of the term "fluff-tongue" to describe a mage that has been deemed untrustworthy.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) charges. As a bonus action, you may use a charge to stuff one of the bulbs of this herb in your mouth. If you do so, you make no audible noise the next time you [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Cast%20a%20Spell\|cast a spell]] that has a verbal component.
