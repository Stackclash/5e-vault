# Wishing Well Token
*Wondrous item, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Wishing-Well-Token.webp#right)  


A wishing well token is a coin that has sat at the bottom of a well for a prolonged period of time. For every ten consecutive years that a mundane coin sits in a well, there is a 1 percent chance that at the end of that time, it transforms into a wishing well token.

While holding the token, you can use an action to make a wish; you must then immediately throw the coin into a well. When you do, the well erupts in an instantaneous column of brilliant light, and your wish comes true (as if by the wish spell). This version of the spell is less potent: any number listed in the spell is reduced by half, and it can't undo a recent event or otherwise adjust the flow of time. Further, this version of the spell can't be used to achieve something beyond the scope of the supplied options. For example, a wishing well token can allow up to ten creatures to regain all their hit points, create an object up to 12,500 gp in value, or duplicate any spell of 4th level or lower.

The well in which the token was thrown then magically produces pure, potable water. It always remains full, regardless of drought or overuse. This benefit lasts for 10 years.

Once the coin has been used to make a wish, it becomes a mundane coin without any magical properties again.
