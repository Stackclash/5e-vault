# Purse Piglet
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This ceramic piglet figurine is glazed with a friendly pink coating that's soft to the touch and has a hole in the top that's stoppered with a cork. When you drop a coin in the piglet and stopper it, the figurine springs to life. When it does, it imprints on you and considers you its owner. The owner can hold and gently shake the piglet, causing it to oink happily, and magically know how much money is inside of it.

Once alive, the piglet happily eats any coin handed to it: storing it inside. The piglet will spit out exact change when you or an ally asks for it, even converting them into larger or smaller denominations. The figurine can only hold coins and will spit or sneeze out anything else you place inside of it. The piglet squeals with glee and prances about excitedly when you deposit or feed it coins. The pig can eat up to 1000 coins of any denomination every hour it spends eating them. It will eat electrum pieces with less enthusiasm. It remains the same size regardless of how many coins are inside of it. The piglet is exceptionally loyal and will listen to commands given by its owner and other allied creatures of the owner's choosing. It walks beside you or its nearest ally as best it can, but vanishes into a pocket dimension if it is ever more than 30 feet away from one of you. The figurine can be summoned to you or another allied creature's location as a bonus action by saying the command phrase "Come home, little piggy". You can tell the figurine to return to its pocket dimension using another bonus action to say the command phrase "Go to market, little piggy."

When asking for 10% or more of its total stockpile, the piglet looks disappointed before carrying out the request. The piglet can eject its own stopper and roll over on its back to empty itself of coins when it's asked for a large amount, but will always retain at least one copper coin unless you physically remove it. The figurine returns to its inanimate form when there are no more coins inside of it.

The piglet has 5 hit points, an AC of 10, and a walking speed of 30 feet. It does not need air to breathe. If the piglet is reduced to 0 hit points, it cries out and shatters into hundreds of ceramic pieces. While your coins are not lost, it takes the piglet `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) days to rematerialize again before you.

If the pig's owner dies, the distraught pig empties itself of all its coins: returning to its inanimate ceramic form atop of whatever coins were inside of it.

Placing the piglet inside an extradimensional space created by a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Holding.md\|bag of holding]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Portable Hole.md\|portable hole]], or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. When this happens, the piglet is permanently destroyed, and its contents are lost. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and cannot be reopened again.
