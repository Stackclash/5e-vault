# Warding Armor
*Major*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Warding-Armor.webp#right)  


While wearing this armor, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you take from nonmagical attacks is reduced by 1 (uncommon), 3 (rare), or 4 (very rare). The very rare version of this armor can also reduce damage in this way from magical attacks, in addition to nonmagical ones.
