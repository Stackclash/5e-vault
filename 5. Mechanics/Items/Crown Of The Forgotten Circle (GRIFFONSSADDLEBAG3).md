# Crown of the Forgotten Circle
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Crown-of-the-Forgotten-Circle.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This flower crown is forever dried and wilted, and is filled with nettles and briars. While wearing it, you have resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and you always have the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blight.md\|blight]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spike Growth.md\|spike growth]] spells prepared. These spells don't count against the total number of spells you can prepare each day.

As an action while wearing the crown, you can choose a point on the ground that you can see within 120 feet of you to cause a dense cluster of nettles to spring forth. The nettles grow in a 30-foot-radius circle, centered on that point, which last for 10 minutes before withering and turning to dust. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration for all creatures other than you. An affected creature that starts its turn in the nettles or enters them for the first time on its turn immediately takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) poison damage. If a creature takes 10 or more poison damage from the briars before the effect ends, that creature becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 hour. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Curse

This crown is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling and unable to remove the crown. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the number of hit points is reduced by 5 + the spell's level, as the crown's flowers try and fail to rejuvenate themselves with your magic.
