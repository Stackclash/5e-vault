This soft cloak was once a child's beloved blanket and has been miraculously enchanted by their hopes and dreams. While worn as a cloak, you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and magic can't put you to sleep. When unclasped, it can still be used as a warm blanket. When used as a blanket while sleeping or over the course of a short or long rest, you can't be unwillingly targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dream.md\|dream]] spell, you gain a +3 bonus to your passive Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) score, and you can't be surprised as a result of being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]]. Regardless of how the cloak is used, you can tolerate temperatures as low as âˆ’50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.
