# Snuff
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Sickle.md\|sickle]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Snuff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This dark metal sickle was forged with an unusually harsh angle and has a unique power over light and shadow. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can speak the sickle's command word as an action to dispel magical lights and extinguish nonmagical flames within 60 feet of you. Magical lights dispelled in this way are affected as if they were targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] spell. Once this property of the sickle has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

As an action, you can draw your hand over the sickle's handle to magically extend it downward: turning the sickle into the form of a scythe wreathed in shadow. While in this form, the sickle has the two-handed and reach properties. While holding the weapon, you can return the sickle to its one-handed form using a bonus action.

This weapon is particularly lethal to creatures. Creatures hit by this weapon take an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage. This bonus increases to `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) if the weapon is transformed into the scythe.
