# Lightning Pylons
*Rod, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Lightning-Pylons.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

These 3-foot-long rods are made using a blend of magic and science and normally come in sets of three. The pylons are tipped with a fragment of a blue dragon's horn. A lightning pylon can extend electricity to any neighboring pylons to create an electrical barrier between them. Each pylon has an electrical charge. Once a charge has been lost, it takes 12 hours to recharge.

You can place a pylon upright in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you using an action. If a pylon has an electrical charge, you can speak its command word as a bonus action if you're within 5 feet of it. When you do, that pylon is electrified for 1 minute and loses its electrical charge at the end of that minute. Any other pylon with an electrical charge placed within 20 feet of an electrified pylon also becomes electrified, creating a wall of lightning between them that is 10 feet tall and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and casts bright light out to 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can have up to 6 pylons connected in this way at one time. Electrified pylons are magically bound to the ground until they lose their charge.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `dice:5d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d8`) lightning damage and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much lightning damage and its speed is halved instead. Creatures made of metal or wearing metal armor have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature that enters the wall for the first time on its turn or ends its turn within 5 feet of it must also make the saving throw.

Each magic pylon has AC 15 and 20 hit points. A creature that touches an electrified pylon or hits it with a metal melee weapon takes `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) lightning damage for each pylon connected to it, including itself. When a pylon is reduced to 0 hit points, it falls over and loses its electrical charge, ending any connection it has to other pylons. A pylon reduced to 0 hit points can't be used again until 2 days have passed, at which point it regains all its hit points.
