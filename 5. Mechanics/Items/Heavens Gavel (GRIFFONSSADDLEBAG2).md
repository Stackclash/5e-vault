- **Damage**: 2d6 B

This platinum weapon was a gift from a divine dragon to one of her loyal knights and has been passed down for generations. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an evil-aligned creature with the weapon, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) radiant damage.

The maul has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with the maul, you can expend up to 3 of its charges as part of the attack. When you do, the target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is launched 10 feet away from you for each expended charge, or half as far on a successful one. If the target hits a solid object by being launched in this way, it takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it had left to travel from the impact. If the solid object is a creature, that creature takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage from the impact as the target of the attack.
