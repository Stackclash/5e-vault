# Ring of Rituals
*Ring, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Ring-of-Rituals.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word to cause a small, illusory flame to appear above it. The flame emits light like a normal candle but doesn't require oxygen or give off heat. Speaking the command word again snuffs out the light.

In addition, when you cast the ritual version of a spell, you can use the ring as a material component of the spell in addition to its normal requirements. When you do, the ritual version of the spell's total casting time is reduced by 5 minutes. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
