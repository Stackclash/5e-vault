# Blighted Pollen
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

A breed of amaranth with a sickly, pale-purple colouration. Unlike the more widespread varieties cultivated for their nutritional purposes, this plant is viewed as a pest due to its pollen which causes allergic reactions in virtually every creature that inhales it. Although the effect varies from creature to creature, they are universally considered extreme and dangerous. As such, it is customary for farmers to burn this plant whenever they find it in order to avoid its spread at any cost.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) charges. As an action, you may use a charge to toss a pinch of this herb's pollen ata creature you can see within 5 feet of you, forcing them to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 10 minutes. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the creature also suffers an additional random effect determined by rolling on the table below. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] creature may attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.
