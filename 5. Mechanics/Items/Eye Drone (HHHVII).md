# Eye Drone
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This small drone consists of a froghemoth's prehensile eye stalk along with a number of brass mobility components and electrical nodes. If you speak this item's command word while holding it, it becomes animate and will obey any order you give it to the best of its ability. The drone is not capable of making attacks, but it can move around independently and is capable of vision, including [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. The drone has a walking speed and a swim speed of 30 feet and has a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]] bonus of `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)`. While holding the drone, you may spend an action focusing on it to learn anything it has seen since becoming animate. The drone becomes inanimate after 1 hour, if you speak its command word again while holding it, or if it drops to 0 hit points. The drone has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, is immune to psychic and poison damage, and has resistance to lightning damage. If it suffers lightning damage, its speed is doubled until the end of its next turn.
