This slingshot requires two hands to attack and is adorned with coin-like designs. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you make a ranged attack with this weapon and use a coin as its ammunition, it deals extra damage on a hit based on the value of the coin you use:
