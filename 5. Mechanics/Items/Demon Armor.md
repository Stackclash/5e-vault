While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal.

## Curse

Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
