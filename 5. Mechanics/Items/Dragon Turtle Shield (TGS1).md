# Dragon Turtle Shield
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Dragon-Turtle-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This shield is made from a piece of reclaimed dragon turtle shell. The brass dragon turtle head sculpture adorning its front magically creates and heats a small reservoir of water that replenishes daily at dawn. When you take fire damage while holding this shield, you can use a reaction to speak the shield's command word. When you do, the water inside it is superheated, reducing the fire damage you take by half. The superheated water is released as a dense cloud of steam that's centered on your space, heavily obscuring the area in a 45-foot sphere that spreads around corners. The cloud does not move with you and lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

Once this property has been used, the shield's reservoir is empty and can't be used again in this way until the next dawn when it replenishes or until it's submerged in nonmagical salt water for 1 hour.
