# Wand of Confusion
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This wand has 4 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 4th-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you spend.

The wand regains `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
