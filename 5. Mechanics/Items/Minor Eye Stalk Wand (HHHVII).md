# Minor Eye Stalk Wand
*Wand, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While holding this wand, you may spend an action to shoot a magical ray of energy at a target creature within 60 feet of you. The type of ray depends on the type of gazer eye stalk that the wand was crafted from. Consult the list below to find out what your wand does.

- **1. Dazing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] until the start of your next turn. While the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls.  
- **2. Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] until the start of your next turn.  
- **3. Frost Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) cold damage.  
- If the target is a creature that is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 30 feet directly away from you. If the target is an object weighing 10 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, you move it up to 30 feet in any direction. You can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a container.  

Once this item has been used once, it crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
