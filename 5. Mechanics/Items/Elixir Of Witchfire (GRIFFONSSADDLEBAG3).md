# Elixir of Witchfire
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


FOR [HEDGE MAGE](compendium/classes/wizard-hedge-mage-griffonssaddlebag3.md#Hedge%20Mage%20(Level%202)) USE ONLY

Ingredients: A piece of charcoal, frog stomach, and thistle leaf.

Command: "Burn in mine fire, for evil most dire."

When a creature drinks this elixir, it takes 3d6 acid damage. The damage increases to 5d6 when you reach 14th level in this class. The poison is nearly tasteless and odorless, but a creature can detect its presence, such as in a food or drink, with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your wizard spell save DC.
