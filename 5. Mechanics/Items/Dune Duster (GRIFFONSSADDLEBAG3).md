While wearing this rugged cloak, you can withstand temperatures as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit and are unaffected by difficult terrain created by sand. You also can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Surprised\|surprised]], and when you roll initiative, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll as long as you aren't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]].

On your first turn of each combat, your speed is increased by 10 feet, and you can use a bonus action to make a single weapon attack against a creature that hasn't taken its turn yet. If you're first in the initiative order, your speed is increased by 20 feet instead, and the bonus weapon attack is made with advantage.
