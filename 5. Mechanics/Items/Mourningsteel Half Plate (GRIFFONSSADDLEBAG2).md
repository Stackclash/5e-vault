![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mourningsteel-Half-Plate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 15 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

This dark armor has been made from mourningsteel, a metal refined from ore found beneath the battlefields of particularly vicious wars. Steeped in the blood from relentless battles, this metal carries with it a magical aversion to all things holy. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to radiant damage. While you wear it, you gain the following benefits:

## Death Transference

Whenever you are subjected to necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage and instead gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dusk.

## Spells

You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from the armor: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Divine Word.md\|divine word]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Nondetection.md\|nondetection]]. Once the armor has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dusk.

## The Battlefield Remembers

You can use an action to touch a weapon, piece of armor, or similar object that's seen blood and battle to recreate the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Legend Lore.md\|legend lore]] spell, using the touched object as the subject of the effect. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

## Unholy Aura

As a bonus action, you can speak the armor's command word to surround yourself with an aura of grim blasphemy. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] or die. For the duration, celestials have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and the first time that a celestial moves within 5 feet of you on its turn or starts its turn there, that creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) necrotic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. In addition, once before the aura ends, if you fail a saving throw against an effect from a celestial (such as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Solar.md\|solar]]'s Slaying Longbow), you can choose to succeed instead. Once the aura ends, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
