# Shunflower
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A curious flower that is said to have been created in fields in which the influence of the Shadowfell has been felt, corrupting the otherwise mundane sunflowers. Indeed, this herb can be considered the inverse of a sunflower: purple in colour instead of a bright yellow-orange, following the moon instead of the sun, and being covered in an aura that subconsciously causes creatures to avoid them. Indeed, this herb has been used in the past to mark the houses and clothes of outcasts and pariahs, warning passersby to not interact with them and avoid them at all costs.

## Effect:

A creature that has this herb on their person has disadvantage on Charisma ability checks.
