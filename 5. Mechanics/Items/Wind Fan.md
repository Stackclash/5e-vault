# Wind Fan
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/wind-fan.webp#right]]  


While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gust Of Wind.md\|gust of wind]] spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
