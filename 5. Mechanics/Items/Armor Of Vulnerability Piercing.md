# Armor of Vulnerability (Piercing)
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to piercing damage.

## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to bludgeoning and slashing damage.
