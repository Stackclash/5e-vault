# Lucidity Lavender
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A wonderfully fragrant strain of lavender with sprigs in the distinctive shape of an arrowhead. It has been used for millennia as a natural stimulant by anyone wandering the wilderness, as its invigorating scent when burned clears the mind and allows one to maintain their senses in even the most dire circumstances.

## Effect:

After using this herb, you gain a heightened sense of clarity for the next 4 hours. During this time, you are automatically aware of an illusion's true nature when you look at it, and you have advantage on any ability check or saving throw to identify if a sound you are hearing is a mimicry or artificially produced.

> Lucidity Lavender is a wonderful plant that I keep all year round in my personal garden and pack with me in my smoking satchel whenever I am on my travels. The remarkable clarity it grants has saved me from a number of potentially dangerous situations including, but not limited to: being tricked by a desert oasis, identifying a devil among his many mirror images, and marrying a swamp hag that had disguised herself as a beautiful maiden (which you can read about in 'Hamund's Hook-Ups, Volume XIII')
