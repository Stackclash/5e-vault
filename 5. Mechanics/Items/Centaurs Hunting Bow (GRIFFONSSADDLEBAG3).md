This hefty wooden hunting bow was fashioned in the likeness of a centaur deity of wisdom. The bow has 4 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to magically mark that target for 1 minute (no action required). For the duration, the first time you make an attack with the bow on your turn, a single magic missile dart streaks out from the bow toward each marked creature within 80 feet of you. A target can't have more than one mark on it at a time.
