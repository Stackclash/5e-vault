# Reactive Piston
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This piston may be attached to heavy armor. Doing so takes 1 hour and it takes 10 minutes to remove. While wearing armor that has this piston attached, if you are struck by a critical hit by a creature within 5 feet of you, you may spend your reaction to force that creature to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, that creature is struck by this piston and suffers `dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage, and if they are size Large or smaller, are also pushed back 5 feet.
