# Bewildering Bagpipes
*Instrument, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This set of bagpipes creates a sound similar to that of a grung's chirr when used. If a bard uses this instrument as a spellcasting focus while attempting to cast a spell that would impose the charm condition on a target, the range of that spell is doubled.
