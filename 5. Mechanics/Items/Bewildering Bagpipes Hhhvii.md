# Bewildering Bagpipes
*Instrument, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bagpipes.md\|bagpipes]] creates a sound similar to that of a grung's chirr when used. If a bard uses this instrument as a spellcasting focus while attempting to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#cast%20a%20spell\|cast a spell]] that would impose the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charm]] condition on a target, the range of that spell is doubled.
