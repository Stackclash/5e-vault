# Explosive Flail
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Flail.md\|flail]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Explosive-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The head of this magic flail floats softly on its own, as if by a gentle current, and is covered in blunt metal prongs. The weapon's head releases a controlled explosion when it impacts a target. The first target you hit with this flail on each of your turns takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) fire damage. If you roll a 4 on the fire damage die in this way, any creature within 5 feet of the target (other than you) also takes 4 fire damage.
