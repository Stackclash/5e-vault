# Turtle Pack
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Turtle-Pack.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

This backpack is armored with the shell of a mighty turtle. Wearing or removing the backpack requires an action. It functions as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hewards Handy Haversack.md\|Heward's Handy Haversack]] with the following changes and additional benefits:

The backpack has only the central pouch of the haversack.

The backpack always weighs 20 pounds, regardless of its contents.

The backpack can't be destroyed by being torn or pierced.

While wearing the backpack, you can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.

While wearing the backpack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn whenever you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dodge\|Dodge]] action.

While useful, the bag is a little unwieldy. A creature wearing the backpack can only stand up from being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] by using an action unless another friendly creature is within 5 feet of it.
