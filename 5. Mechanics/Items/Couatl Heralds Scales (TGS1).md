# Couatl Herald's Scales
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Scale Mail.md\|scale mail]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Couatl-Heralds-Scales.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 45.0 lbs.

This enchanted armor is made from [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Couatl.md\|couatl]] scales that were collected by a generous celestial. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. This armor does not impose disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks.

## Tooth and Scale

When you take damage from a creature within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to channel the good spirit within the armor and cause a bright, spectral couatl to appear above you. The spectral form strikes at the creature who damaged you, forcing it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) radiant damage, or half as much damage on a success. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Flight of the Couatls

While you're attuned to 3 items with this property, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, your flying speed increases by 30 feet instead.
