This magic shield offers a degree of control over the seas. You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wielding this shield in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. While attuned to the shield, you're proficient with water vehicles.

This shield has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the shield, you can expend 3 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Control Water.md\|control water]] spell (save DC 15) from it. Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to magically take control of a water vehicle you can see within 300 feet of you that has a rudder. When you do, if that water vehicle has a creature currently controlling its rudder, you must make a Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) check contested by the other creature's Strength (Athletics) check. If you win the contest, you wrestle control away from the creature and can alter the direction of the vehicle by up to 90 degrees. If there is no creature controlling the direction of the water vehicle, you automatically succeed on this contest. You maintain control of this vehicle until the start of your next turn.
