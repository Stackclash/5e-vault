# Starmetal Ring
*Ring, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Starmetal-Ring.webp#right)  


This roughly crafted metal ring seems to have an otherworldly pull on other metallic items.

While wearing the ring, you can spend 1 hour holding onto an object weighing no more than 25 pounds that is at least 50% metal. If the ring and metallic item are in contact for the full hour, they form a powerful and magically controllable magnetic bond. You can only have one item bound to the ring in this way at a time.

While the bound item is within 40 feet from you and unobstructed, you can use a bonus action on your turn to magically pull it up to 20 feet toward you. The returning item bounces harmlessly against creatures and objects as it passes by.
