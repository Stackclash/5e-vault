# Fumbleweed
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A rather hardy type of grass that has adapted to the harsh desert winds by being particularly springy and flexible, as well as by having an internal, fluid-based gyroscopic system that helps it remain upright even when uprooted. It is so adept at this ability in fact, that creatures traversing the desert have taken to attaching it to themselves or stuffing it in their clothes in order to avoid being knocked over or stumbling in the loose desert sands.

## Effect:

The next time you are knocked prone involuntarily after using this herb, you may use your reaction to not be knocked prone instead. After this occurs, this herb breaks and becomes useless.
