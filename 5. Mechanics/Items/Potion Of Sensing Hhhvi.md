# Potion of Sensing
*Potion, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you gain the ability to sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of you that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. You can pinpoint such a creature that is moving. This incredibly fishy smelling potion is a sickly purple colour with cloudy segments that take a more distinct shape when you hold it and imagine things.
