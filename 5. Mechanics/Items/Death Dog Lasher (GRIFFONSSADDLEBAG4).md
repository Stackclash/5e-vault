# Death Dog Lasher
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Whip.md\|whip]]), uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Death-Dog-Lasher.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This twin-lashed whip was made from the fur and hide of a death dog. A target hit with the whip takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) slashing damage from the attack.

When two of the whip's slashing damage dice roll a 4, the target of the attack must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of your next turn. For the duration, this property of the whip ceases to function.
