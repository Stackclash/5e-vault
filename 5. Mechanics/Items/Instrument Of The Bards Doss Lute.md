# Instrument of the Bards, Doss Lute
*Wondrous item, instrument, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/instrument-of-the-bards-doss-lute.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fly.md\|fly]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md\|invisibility]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Levitate.md\|levitate]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Evil And Good.md\|protection from evil and good]].

In addition, the Doss lute can be used to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animal Friendship.md\|animal friendship]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Energy.md\|protection from energy]] (fire only), and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Poison.md\|protection from poison]].
