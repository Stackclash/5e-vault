# Hedgewitch's Gardening Gloves
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Hedgewitchs-Gardening-Gloves.webp#right)  


These leafy, long gardening gloves are adorned with enchanted vines that cinch its sides together. While wearing the gloves, you gain a +3 bonus to Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Nature\|Nature]]) and Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks made to interact with plants.

In addition, the gloves have 2 magical bunches of herbs, one on each glove, that regrow daily at dawn. When you cast a spell that requires [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]], you can speak the gloves' command word to consume 1 bunch of herbs. When you do, the herbs dry and crumble, duplicating the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Barkskin.md\|barkskin]] spell on yourself. This effect lasts for as long as you concentrate on the original spell, up to a maximum of 1 hour. It ends early if you remove either of the gloves.
