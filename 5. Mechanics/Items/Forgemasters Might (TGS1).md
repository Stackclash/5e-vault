# Forgemaster's Might
*Major, legendary (requires attunement by a creature with a Strength score of 17 or higher)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Forgemasters-Might.webp#right)  


This monumental weapon requires a Strength of 17 or higher to wield. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use a bonus action to speak the hammer's command phrase, "light the forge" and cause flames to curl up and heat the hammer's anvil head. These flames shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the hammer is lit, it deals an additional `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) fire damage to any target it hits and ignores resistance to fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word "quench," or until you drop or stow the hammer.

## Smith's Blessing

You can use the hammer to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Creation.md\|creation]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fabricate.md\|fabricate]] spell using an action instead of its usual casting time. *Creation* is cast as a 6th level spell when cast in this way, and its conjured materials can be used as materials for the *fabricate* spell, although the materials still have a limited duration. Once the hammer has been used to cast a spell in this way, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the following dawn.

In addition, you know the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mending.md\|mending]] cantrip if you don't already know it while you're attuned to the hammer. Mending's usual size restriction is increased to 5 feet in any dimension for you when you use it to repair metal. Ability checks you make using [[5. Mechanics/Items/Smiths Tools.md\|smith's tools]] to make or repair an item are made with advantage when you use the hammer's head as the anvil.

## Iron Raze

The hammer deals an additional `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage to constructs and structures hit by it.
