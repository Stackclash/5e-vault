# Sailor's Omen
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

This algae takes the ominous form of small red clumps that resemble splotches of blood when they gather on the surface of the ocean. Due to this, they have entered one of the many tall tales told by sailors who believe that these "blood splotches" are omens of past seamen that died a violent death and will curse any voyage that comes near. Funnily enough, this legend actually has some merit as this algae actually does grow from blood spilled in the water, but it is usually from feeding shark frenzies rather than anything phantasmic. Incidentally, its bloody base works as a circulatory cleanser and can act as a prophylactic against poisons and other toxins.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, you are immune to poison damage and the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] condition.
