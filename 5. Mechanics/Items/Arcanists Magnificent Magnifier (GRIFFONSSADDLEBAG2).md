# Arcanist's Magnificent Magnifier
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*

This magical magnifying glass helps deduce the arcane nature of items. While looking through the glass at an object within 1 foot of you, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) or Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check you make regarding that object's magical properties. In addition, you can speak the glass's command word as an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell from it, targeting an object with the spell that you can see through the glass within 1 foot of you. Each time you do, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance that the glass shatters and is destroyed after casting the spell.
