# Serpent Shield
*Shield, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: Crafted by
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This shield is plated with scales taken from a yuan-ti abomination and pulses with the residual divine magic of the serpent gods. While wearing this shield, you may spend a bonus action to transform the shield and the arm holding it into a single serpent attached to your shoulder for the next 10 minutes.

This shield does not provide any bonus to AC while it is in serpent form. You may make melee weapon attacks with your serpent appendage by having it bite your targets. When used for melee weapon attacks, your serpent appendage is considered to have the finesse, reach, and light properties and deals `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) piercing damage plus `dice: 1d6|avg|noform` (`1d6`) poison damage on a successful hit. You may at any point, spend a bonus action to transform your serpent appendage back into your arm and shield.

Once this ability has been used, you may not use it again until the end of your next long rest.
