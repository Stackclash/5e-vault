# Altar of Unyielding Faith
*Wondrous item, requires installation, very rare*

Install this altar in your temple and choose a row on the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Servitors (SAF).md\|Servitors]] chart (page 31). Whenever you roll on this chart, you may choose the chart entry one higher than the result you rolled.
