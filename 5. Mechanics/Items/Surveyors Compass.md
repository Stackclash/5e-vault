# Surveyor's Compass
*Wondrous Item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/surveyor-compass.jpg#right)  


A compass of dwarven origin. Above the north marking of the compass is a small receptacle. Once per season, placing a piece of ore or precious stone into it causes the needle on the compass to point toward the nearest seam containing that material within 12 miles. This seam holds ore and gems worth `4d4 Ã— 100` gp, and mining the seam takes three weeks.
