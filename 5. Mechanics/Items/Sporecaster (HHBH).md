# Sporecaster
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A brown fungus easily identified by the many small pores that dot its conical shape. This mushroom's name is incredibly appropriate, as each of its pores are capable of launching large clouds of noxious spore clouds once agitated. This activity allows it to spread its spores onto nearby foraging creatures, using them to disseminate itself long distances in the absence of winds in its cavernous home. Some cave moles have actually been seen taking advantage of the fungus by attaching it to themselves, thereby launching the toxic spores at any creature that would attempt to devour them.

## Effect:

As part of using this herb, you tuck segments of this herb into specific segments of your clothes and armour. Whenever you are successfully hit by a melee weapon attack, you release a burst of spores in a 5-foot radius around you. Any creature other than you in this burst must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute on a failure. Once you have released 4 bursts of spores, the fungi segments in your clothes and armour becomes empty and this effect ends.
