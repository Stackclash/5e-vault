# Barge Helm
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Barge-Helm.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This flat, rugged helmet lets you run headlong into targets and bowl them over with abandon. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Shove\|shove]] them on the same turn, the target takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage from being barreled into by the helmet.
