# Starmetal Constellation Scepter
*Rod, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Starmetal-Constellation-Scepter.webp#right)  


This metal scepter has a pair of floating astrolabe rings rotating around its head. Small stars connected by silver lines decorate its surface.

You can use a bonus action while holding this scepter to create a floating, 5-foot-diameter sphere of light in an unoccupied space that you can see within 60 feet of you. The sphere sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The light is sunlight. You can move one or more of the spheres up to 20 feet as part of this bonus action. You can have up to four spheres at a time. Each sphere remains for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). If you make a fifth sphere, the first one winks out.

A creature that starts its turn within the bright light or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage.

You can use an action on your turn while holding this scepter to cause two or more of the spheres to emit a beam of light between them, provided that the spheres are no more than 60 feet away from one another. Each beam connects any two spheres, creating a line of light between them that's 1 inch thick. Any creature caught in one or more of the lines must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) radiant damage. The beams then vanish.
