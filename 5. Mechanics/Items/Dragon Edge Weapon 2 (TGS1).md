# Dragon Edge Weapon +2
*Major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Dragon-Edge-Weapon.webp#right)  


This weapon is made from the harvested remains of a fallen dragon. With a properly reclaimed claw or tooth, the resource can be forged into a simple piercing or slashing weapon whose latent draconic powers can appear in battle.

The first time you hit a creature on your turn with this weapon with an attack that you had advantage on, its draconic magic comes forth to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage of the original dragon's elemental type.

Weapons made from the claws or teeth of dragons change in rarity and power depending on the original dragon's age. Ancient dragons can create very rare weapons that have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with them.
