# Mindwipe Lenses
*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

These lenses have 10 charges. While wearing and attuned to these lenses, you may expend those charges to do any of the following.

## Devil's Sight

You may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to enhance your vision with fiendish energy. For the next hour, you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and magical darkness doesn't impede your vision.

## Spellcasting

You may spend your action and a number of charges to cast any of the following spells: charm person (1 charge), command (1 charge), dominate person (5 charges), dominate monster (8 charges), feeblemind (9 charges). These spells are cast using your spell save DC. If you do not have one, the DC is set to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.

## Poison Mind

You may use an action to expend 3 charges to target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you or expend 5 charges to target two creatures instead. Targeted creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 4d12|avg` (`4d12`) necrotic damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn.

## Forgetfulness

You may use an action to expend 4 charges to target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is stunned for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours.

These lenses recover all expended charges daily at dawn.
