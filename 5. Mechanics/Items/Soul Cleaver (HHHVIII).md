You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, if you successfully hit a creature with this weapon, you may force them to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature has their connection to their lifeforce disrupted until the end of your next turn. During this time, they cannot regain hit points, they lose any damage resistances they may have had, and they have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws. Undead and constructs are immune to this ability. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until you kill a creature that is not undead or a construct.
