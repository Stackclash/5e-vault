![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Fanfare-Blowgun.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1 P
- **Range**: 25/100
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Loading\|Loading]]
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This weapon appears like a normal fanfare trumpet with a royal flag hanging from its center. You can use the weapon and its properties even if you're not attuned to it. While holding it, you can use an action to magically change the design, cut, and colors of the flag; the flag can't be longer than 3 feet in any direction, and regardless of its appearance, it can't be anything but a flag. If you're proficient with horns, you're proficient with the fanfare blowgun. It can also be used as a normal trumpet.

When you make a ranged weapon attack using this trumpet, it emits a powerful blast of sonic force however, only the target of the attack can hear it. Hit or miss, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) thunder damage, or `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) thunder damage if it was hit by the blowgun dart. If you're attuned to the weapon, this property uses your bard spell save DC instead.
