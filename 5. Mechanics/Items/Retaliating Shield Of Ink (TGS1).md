# Retaliating Shield of Ink
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Retaliating-Shield-of-Ink.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This shield has a hidden compartment inside that can spray thick squid ink at attacking creatures. When a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to press a button on the shield's handle. When you do, ink sprays from the front of the shield at the face of the attacking creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the beginning of its next turn.

The shield can hold up to 3 uses of the ink before needing to be refilled. It takes 1 minute to refill the shield using a vial of squid ink worth at least 20 gp. Alternatively, you can use a vial of thinner writing ink worth 5 gp. If you do. the save DC becomes 10 instead.

This is a mechanical item whose purpose and functionality can be understood following a successful Intelligence check (DC 12). On a success, you can interpret what the shield does, how to use it, and how to take care of it. You also understand that filling the shield with other volatile or sticky liquids such as acid, poison, grog, oil, or any other solid material such as sand, will damage the machinery inside and take 8 hours of work to repair.
