# Amulet of the Usurper
*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This amulet has 20 charges. While wearing it, you may use your action to spend a number of charges for any of the following properties.

## Spellcasting


You may use the amulet to cast any of the following spells using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animate Dead.md\|animate dead]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Burning Hands.md\|burning hands]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Flame Strike.md\|flame strike]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fly.md\|fly]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Geas.md\|geas]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Major Image.md\|major image]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stinking Cloud.md\|stinking cloud]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Suggestion.md\|suggestion]] (2 charges), and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Fire.md\|wall of fire]] (4 charges).

## Teleport

As an action, you may expend 3 charges to teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

## Corruptive Influence

As an action, you may expend 3 charges to release a 20-foot radius burst of corruption centered on yourself. Any creature other than you inside this burst must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you until the start of your next turn. While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you in this way, you may determine who they consider to be friends and who they consider to be enemies (no action required by you). This may result in them attacking creatures they once thought allies, or aiding creatures they once thought enemies. Once a creature has saved against this ability once, they are immune to its effects for the next 24 hours.

This amulet regains all expended charges upon the next dawn.
