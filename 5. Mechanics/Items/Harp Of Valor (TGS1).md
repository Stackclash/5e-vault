# Harp of Valor
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shortbow.md\|shortbow]]), major, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Harp-of-Valor.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 T
- **Range**: 80/320
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This elegant bow has 10 strings and can also be used as both a harp and spellcasting focus. You are proficient with this harp while attuned to the weapon, and Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) checks made using the harp are made with advantage. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, arrows fired from the bow deal thunder damage instead of piercing.

The bow has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the bow, you can expend 1 to 5 of its charges as an action to cast either the thunderwave or magic missile spell from it at a spell level equal to the number of expended charges, using your spellcasting modifier and spell save DC.
