# Cloak of Elvenkind
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/cloak-of-elvenkind.webp#right]]  


While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
