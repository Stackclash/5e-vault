# Platinum Star
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A rather striking flower in the shape of a star, covered in tiny, reflective hairs that grant it the lustre of polished platinum. Found only on dangerous mountain ledges, this flower is revered as a symbol of prowess and honour, as only the most skilled climbers are capable of harvesting them successfully. That said, its inspirational properties extend beyond just the symbolic: the smoke from this herb also boosts endorphins and raises confidence in those that inhale it.

## Effect:

Once prepared, this herb may be used by up to 6 creatures simultaneously. All creatures that used this herb gain inspiration|PHB from Player's Handbook that lasts for the next 8 hours.
