# Infernal Wings
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVI/InfernalWings.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

A repurposed pair of wings harvested from a devil and inlaid with enchantments to make them suitable for mortal use. While they normally take the appearance of a black cloak with a crimson tinge, you speak their command word as an action to transform them into replicas of the wings of the devil they were harvested from and attach them to your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. In this form, they give you a flying speed of 60 feet. In addition, if you are subject to an effect that would cause you to suffer fire damage, you may instead spend your reaction to wrap your wings around yourself and become immune to fire damage and lose the flying speed granted by this item until the start of your next turn.

Once the wings have disappeared, they may not be activated again until the next dawn.
