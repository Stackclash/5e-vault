# Vigilante's Mantle
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Vigilantes-Mantle.webp#right)  


This midnight purple cloak has a hood which covers the top of your face; you can see through a pair of stylized eyes in the hood, which are opaque white. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action. While the hood is pulled up, you're immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and you gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks.

While the hood is pulled up, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and gain one of the following random benefits.

`dice: [[Vigilantes Mantle (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG4).md#^name-benefit]]`

| dice: d4 | Name | Benefit |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Acrobatic | Until the end of your turn, you can jump twice the normal distance, though you can't jump farther than your remaining movement would allow. For the duration, you have advantage on any Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks you make. |
| 2 | Evasive | You take the Dash action as part of the bonus action to use this property. Until the end of your turn, opportunity attacks are made against you with disadvantage. |
| 3 | Tricky | You can immediately move up to 10 feet (without provoking opportunity attacks) and then make two unarmed strikes against a target within 5 feet of you, or vice versa. |
| 4 | Choose | You choose which benefit to gain. |
