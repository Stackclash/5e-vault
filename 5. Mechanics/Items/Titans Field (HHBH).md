# Titan's Field
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

Cave-dwelling cultures across the land all share a similar mythâ€”that of a slumbering or deceased creature of unfathomable size, buried deep beneath the ground. As its blood rises to the surface, it waters patches of soil which in turn sprout a magical, glowing blue grass that contains a portion of the titan's power. What is even more amazing is that this myth is not far off from the truth. In fact, what these cultures thought was grass is actually a sprouting mycelium network, and the buried titan is a massive fungus that spreads underground across continental distances. By covering oneself in this mycelium, it is possible to connect oneself to this network and thus share in some of the power and knowledge of this ancient and omnipresent organism.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, you are connected to the mycelium network, granting you the following abilities:

- You have a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Tremorsense\|tremorsense]] out to 60 feet.  
- You have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) and Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) checks  
- You may use your action to teleport you and up to 6 willing creatures within 10 feet of you, to a cave location you have visited before. Once you have used this ability once, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.  
- Whenever you take damage, you may use your reaction to reduce the damage taken by `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) by redirecting some of it into the mycelium network itself. Once you have used this ability 6 times, your connection to the mycelium network breaks, and the effect of this herb ends immediately.
