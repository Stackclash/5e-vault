# Criir's Blade
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Longsword.md\|longsword]]), major, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Criirs-Blade.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]

This mighty blade belongs to the Astral Griffon Criir, a patron deity of artisans and craftsmen. Only a creature chosen by Criir can attune to this weapon, which is shared by those deemed worthy across the multiverse. Heroes selected to wield the blade are often set on great adventures across the planes of existence, and typically share at least some of the astral griffon's passion for creation.

While attuned to the sword, you can use a bonus action to summon it to your empty hand from a special demiplane. You are proficient with this weapon while you're attuned to it, which has the finesse property and is seemingly weightless in your grasp. The blade returns to its demiplane if it is more than 30 feet away from you for 1 minute or more or if you dismiss it (no action required).

## Magic Weapon

Criir's Blade is a magic weapon that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It also functions as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dancing Sword.md\|dancing sword]].

## Charges

The sword has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

## Spells

While holding the sword, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Creation.md\|creation]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fabricate.md\|fabricate]] spell from it.

## Starlight Crash

While holding the sword, you can use an action to cause it to teleport up to 40 feet in the air above a point that you can see within 120 feet of you. As part of this action, you can expend up to 3 of the sword's charges to cause it to then release an incinerating pillar of light from it in a 40-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder toward the ground. Each creature within the pillar must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) radiant damage for each expended charge on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Regardless of whether or not you expended any charges, the sword then plummets to the ground at the point below it, creating a blast upon impact in a 10-foot radius. Each creature within that radius must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The sword then returns to your hand. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Warping Strike

While holding the sword, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of making an attack with it. When you do, you can teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you either before or after making the attack. If the attack hits, the target also takes an extra `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) force damage.

## Destroying the Blade

Only Criir can destroy the weapon, which requires it to be unmade while within the extradimensional space of a Griffon's Saddlebag.
