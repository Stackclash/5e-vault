# Dragon Tamer Lance
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance.md\|lance]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Dragon-Tamer-Lance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 P
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Special%20Weapons\|special]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This slender, iridescent lance is covered in an enchanted finish that resembles the hardened scales of many dragons. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to the weapon, you can, understand and speak Draconic.

This lance has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d4+4|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 4`) expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a target with the lance, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice) to the target. If you expend a charge in this way when you hit a dragon, it must also succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the beginning of your next turn. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.

Whenever you expend a charge in this way to deal extra damage, you can choose to expend a 2nd charge and deal an additional `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage of the same type to the target and prevent it from using its reaction until the start of its next turn.

## Wyrmling Steed

In addition, while holding the lance, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Steed.md\|find steed]] spell from it. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. When you use the lance to cast this spell, you can choose to summon a dragon wyrmling instead of a normal mount by expending a number of charges equal to its challenge rating (maximum 2). You determine the kind of dragon summoned, although its alignment towards good or evil must be the same as your own. If your alignment is neutral, you can summon a wyrmling of either alignment. The wyrmling counts as one size larger when used as a mount and cannot use its breath weapons.

## Forceful Impact

If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a Medium or smaller target and then make a melee attack with the lance against it while within 5 feet of the target, you make the attack with advantage instead of disadvantage. If you hit, you can immediately roll to attack another target 5 feet directly behind the first, without advantage, as part of the initial attack.

## Special

You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
