This powerful longbow originally served a solar, one of the mighty celestials that guard the heavens from evil. Normally unwieldy in the hands of mortals, this bow was bestowed upon a heroic human centuries ago and has been carefully passed down ever since. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic weapon, it takes an extra `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) radiant damage.

In addition, when you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with this bow against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. On a success, a creature takes an extra `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) radiant damage from the hit instead. A creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it is good-aligned or has legendary actions.
