# Enzymatic Gastrostaff
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), spellcasting focus, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Enzymatic-Gastrostaff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff was found in the regurgitated remains of a mighty tarrasque's meal and is covered in a strange, magical mucus. You have resistance to acid damage while you hold this staff. The staff can be used as a magic [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]] and deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) acid damage to any target it hits.

In addition, you can use an action to touch a Medium or smaller willing creature with the staff to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|enlarge/reduce]] spell from it without requiring concentration, targeting the creature with the spell's Enlarge option. While a creature is enlarged in this way, it deals double damage to objects and structures and gains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns, in addition to the spell's normal effects. The effect ends early if the enlarged creature falls to 0 hit points. When the effect ends, the creature gains 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
