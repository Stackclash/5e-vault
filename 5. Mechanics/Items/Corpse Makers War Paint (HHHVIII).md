# Corpse Maker's War Paint
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This jar of magical paint is a swirl of red and yellow, like the skin of a bloated cadaver. You may spend 1 minute smearing this paint over your body, after which you enter a trance for 1 hour in which you are driven by a lust for death and violence. During this hour, you gain the following benefits:

- You cannot be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]].  
- You may use your bonus action to move up to your speed towards a hostile creature you can see.  
- You have advantage on weapon attacks against creatures as long as at least one of your allies are within 5 feet of the creature and your ally isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]].  

While in this trance, whenever a creature you can see hits you with a weapon attack, you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or enter a frenzied state (you may choose to fail this saving throw willingly). While in this state, attacks made against you are made at advantage and you must spend your action to attack the creature that hit you, using as much of your movement speed as possible to reach them if necessary. In addition, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attacks]] you make against the creature that hit you are made at advantage and also reduce their speed to 0 upon a successful hit.

You remain in this frenzied state until either the creature that hit you is dead, you are no longer aware of the location of the creature that hit you, you fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]], or the effects of this paint wear off. If a different creature hits you while in this frenzied state, you must make the saving throw as normal, switching your focus to that different creature upon a failed save.
