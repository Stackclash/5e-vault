# Infernal Engine
*Wondrous item, legendary*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This dark metal box measures 1 foot on all sides and is engraved with ancient runes taken from the manuals of Mechanus. As an action, you may place this item on the ground while speaking its command word. If you do so, the engine attempts to form the shape of a wagon around itself using any solid inorganic material within a 30-foot radius around it that is not worn, carried, or firmly attached to a structure. This open-topped wagon measures 10 feet wide, 20 feet long, and 10 feet high. This process takes 1 minute and fails if there is less than 15 cubic feet of material to use.

Once completed, the wagon can be piloted as an action by the creature that spoke its command so long as that creature is inside the wagon. Piloting the wagon is done through mental commands and requires no manual input. The wagon has a move speed of 60 feet and can hold up to 2,000 lb., but its speed is reduced to half if it carries more than 1,000 lb. The wagon has 18 AC (regardless of material used), 100 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

The wagon may be used for up to 4 hours in one day which may be used all at once or in shorter intervals. The time it takes to form the wagon is not subtracted from this total. The wagon transforms back into the infernal engine instantly if the time elapses, the wagon is reduced to 0 hit points, or the original user speaks the command word again while within 10 feet of it. Once the wagon reverts back into the engine, all used material drops to the ground, inert.
