![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Astral-Sea-Piercer.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This golden war pick was forged in the depths of the Astral Plane and leaves a faint trail of extraplanar energy behind it when swung. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and targets hit by it take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) force damage from the attack. In addition, while you're in the Astral Plane, you always know the direction of the nearest portal to another plane of existence.

## Portal

This weapon has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) expended charges each day at dawn. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of its charges to slam the war pick into any flat, solid surface at least 5 feet across in any direction. When you do, you create a small planar rift. The rift fades after 1 minute. If you expend another charge in this way while there's a rift within 300 feet of you, the two rifts tear open to form a portal between them. The portal lasts until the end of your next turn or until you close it early (no action required). When the portal closes, the rifts fade. Medium and smaller creatures and objects can travel or interact freely through the portal while it's open, carrying with them any momentum they had through to the other side.

Both rifts must be placed on the same plane of existence, and if you create a second rift more than 300 feet away from the first, the first one fades. Rifts can be entered from any direction to travel through a portal. When you enter a rift in this way, you reappear 5 feet in front of the other rift.

In addition, you can expend 1 of the war pick's charges when you hit a Small or larger creature with it. When you do, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) force damage as a rift appears on its body. Rifts that appear on a creature in this way are attached to the creature and move with it until a portal is opened. When a portal opens between two rifts and at least one of the rifts is attached to a creature, the attached creature or creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be immediately shunted through the portal to the other rift's location. Large and larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.
