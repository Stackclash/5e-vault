This sharpened bident is covered in swirling water motifs. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Immediately before you make a melee attack with the weapon while underwater, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

The bident has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn.

## Part Water

While holding the bident, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to make a dry path through a nearby body of water. Choose a point within 60 feet of you that is within a body of water you can see. The path extends in a direction you choose from that point in a straight line that is up to 120 feet long and up to 20 feet wide. The path also extends vertically, up to 30 feet high. The path remains for 1 minute or until you end the effect using another action, at which point it slowly refills with water over the next 6 seconds. For each charge you expend after the first, you can cause the path to extend 120 feet longer and 30 feet higher, and its duration increases by 1 minute. Alternatively, you can expend 1 of the bident's charges to use this property to target a creature within 60 feet of you that's made of water, such as a water elemental. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:8d8|noform|avg` (`8d8`) force damage as the bident's magic attempts to split it apart.
