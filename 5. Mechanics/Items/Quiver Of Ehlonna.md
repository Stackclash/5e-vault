# Quiver of Ehlonna
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/quiver-of-ehlonna.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty [[5. Mechanics/Items/Arrow.md\|arrows]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crossbow Bolt.md\|bolts]], or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen [[5. Mechanics/Items/Javelin.md\|javelins]] or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaffs]], or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spear.md\|spears]].

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
