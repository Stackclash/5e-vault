# Fire Flash Armor
*Generic Variant, very rare*  


This piece of armor is fitted with intricate fire giant technology that imbues its wearer with supercharged movement when activated. While wearing this armor, you may spend an action to activate this armor's heat coils. While the heat coils are activated, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and gain an additional action on each of your turns which may only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. While active, you also suffer `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) fire damage at the end of each of your turns. This item remains active for 1 minute, until you spend your action to deactivate this item, or if you are doused with more than 10 gallons of water in a single round. Once this item has been deactivated, it cannot be used again for 24 hours.
