# Bow of the Cobra
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bow-of-the-Cobra.webp#right)  


This metallic bow resembles the shape of a mighty cobra and is covered in spots of patina. When you fire an arrow from the bow, you can choose to coat the arrow in a thin layer of acid. A target hit with the acid-coated arrow takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) acid damage. Hit or miss, a nonmagical coated arrow is destroyed after the attack.

In addition, the bow has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action using this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to replace one of your weapon attacks with a special attack. This special attack duplicates the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Melfs Acid Arrow.md\|acid arrow]] spell and uses the same attack bonus as your normal weapon attacks with the bow.
