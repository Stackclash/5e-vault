# Aboleth Amulet
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This pale turquoise amulet seems to have a faint flicker of something moving in it, like seeing a creature in murky waters. While wearing this amulet, you gain [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Telepathy.md\|telepathy]] out to a range of 120 ft., can understand and speak Deep Speech, and become proficient in Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#History\|History]]) checks if you weren't proficient already.

You may also spend an action to target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you. This charm persists until either you or the target dies, or if you are on different planes of existence. You and the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] target may communicate with each other telepathically over any distance so long as you are wearing and attuned to this item.

You may only have up to 3 targets [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] in this way at a time. If you successfully charm another target while you already have 3 targets [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]], the charm effect ends on the creature that you [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] first. Whenever the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] target takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from you. If a creature succeeds on either resisting the charm effect or if the charm effect on them ends, they become immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.
