# Banshee Vine
*Herb, rare, Herb*

- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

This pale-blue vine grows in areas with high concentrations of saltwater and is usually found wrapped around mangrove trees. While they are relatively mundane plants, they do have one curious trait in which they quickly shed all of their water once picked, turning them into dry, stringy ropes filled with tiny air pockets. If the dehydrated vine is broken afterwards, the air pockets release a high pitched, debilitating screech that resembles a banshee's wail.

## Effect:

As an action, you may break this herb in half, causing all of the air inside to be released in a high-pitched wail. All creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear, must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn.
