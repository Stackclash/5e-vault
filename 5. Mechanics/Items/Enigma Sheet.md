# Enigma Sheet
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This sheet of vellum constantly swirls with random text, runes, and symbols that form vaguely coherent thoughts before they disappear again into the chaos of the ink. As part of a wizard's long rest, they may place this item into their spellbook, placing an enchantment over all of their spells and knowledge. So long as a wizard has this sheet in their spellbook, they may choose to invoke it whenever they cast a spell of level 1 or higher (no action required). If they do so, they must roll a `dice: d6|avg|noform` (`d6`) and use the table below to determine what random effect occurs.

**Enigma**

`dice: [[Enigma Sheet.md#^enigma]]`

| dice: d6 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Your spell fails without any effect and you waste the spell slot used to cast it. |
| 2 | Targets that are affected by your spell make any associated saving throws at advantage. If your spell involved an attack roll, that attack roll is made at disadvantage. |
| 3 | If your spell damages a creature, you take damage equal to the amount that creature took. If your spell damages multiple creatures, you take damage equal to the most amount of damage inflicted on one creature. This damage is unmitigable in any way. |
| 4 | You cast the spell as if it were done using a spell slot one level higher than the one you used, even if that is not a spell slot level that you would normally have access to. |
| 5 | Targets that are affected by your spell make any associated saving throws at disadvantage. If your spell involved an attack roll, that attack roll is made at advantage. |
| 6 | You instantly regain use of the spell slot you used to cast that spell. |
