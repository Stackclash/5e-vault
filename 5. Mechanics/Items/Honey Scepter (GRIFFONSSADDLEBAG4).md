# Honey Scepter
*Rod, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Honey-Scepter.webp#right)  


A quiet buzzing follows this golden scepter, and a honey magically drips from its numerous crevices.

The scepter has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn.

## Spells

While holding the scepter, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell attack bonus and spell save DC: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Melfs Acid Arrow.md\|acid arrow]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Giant Insect.md\|giant insect]] (4 charges; bees or wasps only), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Insect Plague.md\|insect plague]] (5 charges; the insects are bees), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Levitate.md\|levitate]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Web.md\|web]] (2 charges; the webs are actually sticky honey), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Plants.md\|speak with plants]] (3 charges).

## Stinger

The scepter has a sharpened point on its end, allowing you to use it as an improvised dagger, except that it doesn't have the thrown property. The first time on each of your turns that you hit a creature in this way, that creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of your next turn. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way is unable to speak. When you hit a creature with the scepter in this way, you can choose to expend up to 4 of its charges. For each expended charge, the poison damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`), and the save DC increases by 2.
