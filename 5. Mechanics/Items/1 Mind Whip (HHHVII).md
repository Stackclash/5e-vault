> [!note]
> This item is in improved version of the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mind Whip (HHHVI).md\|Mind Whip]].

When you make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check, you may choose to do so with this whip instead of using your free hand. If you do so and if you succeed on the grapple check, you may force the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] creature to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, this whip may not be used to attack another target. Once this ability has been used 4 times in a day, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

You also have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
