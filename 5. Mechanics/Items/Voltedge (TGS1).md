# Voltedge
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Voltedge.webp#right)  


This split metal sword arcs with electricity between its two halves. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage. While holding this sword, you can use an action to unleash a concentrated beam of lightning from the blade in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature within that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
