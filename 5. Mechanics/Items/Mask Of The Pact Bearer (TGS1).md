# Mask of the Pact Bearer
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a warlock)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Mask-of-the-Pact-Bearer.webp#right)  


This mask looks like a normal wooden mask before it's attuned to. When you attune to this mask, your otherworldly patron's lingering presence over you magically reshapes it to represent the visage of your patron. While you wear this mask, you can cast one spell from your patron's expanded spell list without expending a spell slot. The spell must be of a level equal to or less than your warlock spell slot level. A spell cast in this way is always cast at its lowest level, regardless of your normal warlock spell slot level. Once the mask has been used in this way, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
