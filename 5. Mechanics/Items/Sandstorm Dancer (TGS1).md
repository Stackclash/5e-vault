This golden cloak billows illusory sand around you when you walk or cast a spell. The cloak has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the cloak, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it (save DC 15): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blur.md\|blur]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Call Lightning.md\|call lightning]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Or Destroy Water.md\|create or destroy water]] (1 charge), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hallucinatory Terrain.md\|hallucinatory terrain]] (4 charges).
