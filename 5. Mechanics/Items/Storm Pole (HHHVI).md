# Storm Pole
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

This 10-foot-long, 40-pound pole constantly crackles with energy and has an innate connection to the storms and clouds. As long as this pole is planted in the ground and under an open sky, a lightning bolt will strike it from the skies every `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) hours. Any creature within 5 feet of the pole when this happens suffers `dice:12d8|noform|avg` (`12d8`) lightning damage, or half that on a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

A switch on the base of the pole may also be flipped, which causes lightning to strike this pole once every 6 seconds (on initiative count 20 if done during combat) for the next minute, after which the switch flips to the off position. A creature may also spend their action to flip the switch back prematurely. Once the switch has been flipped off, it cannot be flipped back on for another 24 hours.
