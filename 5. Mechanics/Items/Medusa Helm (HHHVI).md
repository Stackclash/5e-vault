# Medusa Helm
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This full helmet is magically fused with the head of a medusa to recreate its petrifying gaze. While wearing this helmet, you may spend your action to open or close the visor; closing the visor causes the medusas visage to be complete and activates this item's ability. While this item's ability is active, any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see and who can see you, must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]]. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]]. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]] on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell or other magic.

The medusa's visage only possesses enough magic to allow its petrifying gaze ability to function for 1 minute. Anytime this item is used, subtract the amount of time it is used from this minute. Once this time has been expended, this item loses its magical property. This item regains all expended time upon the next dawn.
