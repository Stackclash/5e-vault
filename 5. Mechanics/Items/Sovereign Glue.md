# Sovereign Glue
*Wondrous Item, minor, legendary*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/sovereign-glue.webp#right]]  


This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Oil Of Slipperiness.md\|oil of slipperiness]]. When found, a container contains `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Universal Solvent.md\|universal solvent]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Oil Of Etherealness.md\|oil of etherealness]], or with a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell.
