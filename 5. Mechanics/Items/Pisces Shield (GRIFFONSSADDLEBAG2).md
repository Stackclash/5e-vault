- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This round iron shield is emblazoned with two spiraling golden koi. If the shield is submerged in water for at least 1 minute, the koi begin to animate and swim across the surface of the shield for up to 24 hours. While the koi are swimming in this way, the next time you roll a 1 on the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw while holding the shield, you can treat the roll as if it were a 20 instead. When you do, the koi stop swimming, and they can't swim again until 24 hours have passed.
