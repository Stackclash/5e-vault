# Pipes of the Deceiver
*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This pipe has 10 charges. If you are proficient in a wind instrument, you may expend charges and use your action to play this pipe and use one of the following abilities of your choice:

## Spellcasting

You use the pipe to cast one of the following spells of your choice: alter self (2 charges), animate dead (3 charges), bestow curse (3 charges), confusion (4 chargeS), major image (3 charges), modify memory (5 charges), mislead (5 charges), nondetection (3 charges), or sending (3 charges).

## Frightful Word

You expend 2 charges and target one creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Twisting Words

You expend 3 charges and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by you for 1 minute. The charmed target can repeat the saving throw if you deal any damage to it. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If you use this ability on a creature already charmed by you in this way, that creature must make the saving throw again. On a failure, you decide how that target acts on its next turn.

This pipe regains all expended charges at dawn.
