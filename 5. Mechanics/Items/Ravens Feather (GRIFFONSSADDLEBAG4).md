# Raven's Feather
*Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Ravens-Feather.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This dark scythe is lightly iridescent, like a raven. Its blade looks like a large feather. If you're proficient with martial weapons, you are proficient with the raven's feather. The weapon has the two-handed and heavy properties and uses a damage die of `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`); it deals slashing damage on a hit. When you hit a creature with this weapon, a raven feather appears and floats to the ground below it. The feather is illusory, and it remains in the space for up to 1 minute.

You can use a bonus action to magically summon a swarm of ravens while holding the scythe. The swarm appears in your space, and it has a number of hit points equal to 4 times the number of feathers dropped from the scythe within 60 feet of you. The feathers then disappear. The swarm remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points; it regains 4 hit points whenever another feather appears. The swarm can't have more than 24 hit points. If the swarm hits a target, the damage is magical.

You can only have one swarm of ravens at a time. The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your companions. It shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any mental commands that you issue it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.
