# Plate of the Black Rider
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

These thick, pitch-black armor plates are infused with the lingering soul of a narzugon, granting you some of their fiendish abilities. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, while adjacent to a horse that is friendly to you, you may spend 10 minutes bonding with it, transforming it into your steed. At your DM's discretion, this ability may also be used on other riding creatures such as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Mastiff.md\|mastiffs]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/E(LK).md\|elks]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Camel.md\|camels]], etc.

While a creature is your steed, it is completely loyal to your commands and you may use your action to summon your steed to an unoccupied spot within 5 feet of you, so long as both of you are on the same plane of existence. While mounted on your steed, all creatures allied with 30 feet of you that can see you are immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] conditions, and whenever you score a critical hit on a melee weapon attack you may deal an additional `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage.

You may only have one steed at a time; using this ability on another creature while you already have a steed transfers all the benefits from this ability to your new target.
