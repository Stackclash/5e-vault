# Amulet of Radiant Protection
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Amulet-of-Radiant-Protection.webp#right)  


This amulet is decorated with polished platinum, gold, and stained temple glass. While wearing it, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet. You can also use the amulet as a holy symbol.

The amulet has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d4+3|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the amulet, you can use a bonus action to expend up to 4 of its charges. Roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) for each charge you expend and choose up to 4 creatures within the aura. Each of those creatures then gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the total of the roll plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
