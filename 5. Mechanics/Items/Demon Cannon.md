This unique crossbow has replaced its string firing mechanism with a single tube inscribed with Abyssal runes that makes this weapon seem more like a handheld cannon with a trigger. When you make a critical hit with this magical weapon against a target, you may choose for your ammunition to burst, creating a 5-foot wide, 60-foot long line of dark energy behind your target that forces all creatures caught in it to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes `dice: 4d10|avg|noform` (`4d10`) force damage, or half that on a success.
