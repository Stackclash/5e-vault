# Basin of Water Control
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This stone basin measures 1 foot in diameter. If you fill this basin with a sample of water from a source of water that has a radius of less than half a mile, this basin gains a connection to that source of water for 1 hour. A source of water may include a river, a pond, or even a barrel or pitcher. If the source of water is larger than half a mile in radius, this basin has a connection only to the water in a half-mile radius of the point from which you gathered the water.

So long as you hold the basin, you may use your action to exert your influence over the connected area of water as if you had cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Control Water.md\|control water]] spell over it. If an action you use in this way would force a target to make a saving throw, the DC is considered 17.

This basin loses its connection to the water after the 1-hour duration has passed, if you drop the basin, or if the water inside the basin spills out. After this, all effects created by the basin cease immediately. Once used, the basin cannot be used again until the next dawn.
