# Pair of Tiny Violin Rings
*Ring, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Pair-of-Tiny-Violin-Rings.webp#right)  


This pair of golden rings play a sad, sad melody when you rub the two fingers wearing them together. Creatures that know the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vicious Mockery.md\|vicious mockery]] cantrip can use this set of rings as a somatic component instead of the normal verbal component required by the spell.
