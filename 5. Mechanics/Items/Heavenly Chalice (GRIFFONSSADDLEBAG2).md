# Heavenly Chalice
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Heavenly-Chalice.webp#right)  


This golden goblet is ornamented with 4 glimmering gems and stripes of jet and ivory. It weighs 2 pounds and can hold the contents of one potion. When a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing Gv (DMG).md\|potion of healing]] (of any rarity) is poured into the cup, a cleric, paladin, or other creature with a magical connection to a celestial can spend 1 minute reciting a prayer over it. At the end of the prayer, the potion becomes sanctified and begins to glow with a calming blue light. When a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing Gv (DMG).md\|potion of healing]] becomes sanctified, it creates a pool of hit points equal to the maximum number of potential regained hit points possible for that potion.

When a creature drinks from a sanctified [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing Gv (DMG).md\|potion of healing]], that creature can restore a number of hit points of its choice, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool. When the pool is reduced to 0 hit points, the potion is gone.

A potion remains sanctified for 24 hours or until it's spilled or poured into another vessel. Once this property of the goblet has been used, it can't be used again for 24 hours.
