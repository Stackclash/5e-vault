# Toadstool Veil
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Toadstool-Veil.webp#right)  


To wear this wide-brimmed cap, you must use an action to secure it in place with a veil, which is tied around your chin. While wearing it, glimmering spores drift down from the cap and linger around you. The top of the cap is plushly made and flops from side to side. You can use an action to magically change the appearance of the mushroom cap while wearing it. Regardless of its new appearance, it must still resemble a mushroom.

While wearing the cap, fungal plant creatures with a challenge rating of 1 or lower (such as a violet fungus) are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. In addition, when you're hit with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to cause a plume of spores to waft into the attacker's face. The attacker must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) to determine which of the following effects occur.

`dice: [[Toadstool Veil (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^effect]]`

| dice: d4 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The attacker is incapacitated until the end of its next turn or until it takes any damage. It hallucinates for the duration. |
| 2 | The attacker is violently ill and must use its next action retching and reeling. If the attacker would normally be able to make additional attacks on this turn, it can't. |
| 3 | The attacker is confused until the end of its next turn or until it takes any damage. For the duration, its speed is reduced to 0, and it makes as many attacks as possible on its turn. It makes each attack against a random target within its reach, including itself. |
| 4 | The attacker begins to laugh uncontrollably until the end of its next turn. It falls prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. |
^effect

Once an effect's number has been rolled, the next time that number is rolled before the next dawn, nothing happens.
