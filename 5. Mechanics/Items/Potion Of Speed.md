# Potion of Speed
*Potion, minor, very rare*  


When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Haste.md\|haste]] spell for 1 minute (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] required). The potion's yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
