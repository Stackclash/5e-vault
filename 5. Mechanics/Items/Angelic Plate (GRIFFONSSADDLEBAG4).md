# Angelic Plate
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Angelic-Plate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This shimmering silver armor seems to resist even the shadows cast on it. While wearing it, you have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.

The armor produces a faint halo above your head while you wear it, which sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. The light is sunlight.

You can use a bonus action to move the halo to the head of another willing creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. The halo remains there until it's moved more than 120 feet from you or until you use another bonus action to return it to your head.

While the halo is over a creature's head, the creature gains the following benefits:

- It gains a +1 bonus to AC.  
- Any fiend or undead within the halo's light makes attack rolls against the creature with disadvantage.  

## Angelic Avatar

While wearing the armor, you can use an action to transform into a hulking, metal angel for 1 minute. Your size becomes Large, gaining the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell when you do (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] required). You also grow a pair of metal wings, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet. For the duration, your melee weapon attacks deal an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) radiant damage, in addition to the extra damage from enlarge/reduce, and you can roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and add it to the total of any saving throw you make. The effect ends early if you're reduced to 0 hit points or if you use a bonus action to end it early. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, you can use a bonus action to transform into the metal angel, instead of an action. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
