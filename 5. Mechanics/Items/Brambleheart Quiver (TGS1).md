# Brambleheart Quiver
*Wondrous item, adventuring gear, major, very rare (requires attunement by a ranger)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Brambleheart-Quiver.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This wooden quiver can carry your arrows as well as provide some of its own. The quiver has 4 grown arrows and regrows `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) picked arrows daily at dawn. The grown arrows are thorned and remain attached to the quiver until picked for use (no action required). While you're attuned to the quiver, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic arrows. A grown arrow is no longer magical after 1 minute has passed since it was first picked from the quiver.

When you fire and hit a target or point with one of these magic arrows, you can use a bonus action on that same turn to speak the quiver's command word. When you do, that arrow transforms into a thick field of thorns to recreate the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spike Growth.md\|spike growth]] spell, centered on its location. This effect does not require concentration and lasts until the start of your next turn. If the arrow was lodged in a target when you use this property, that target also takes `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) piercing damage.
