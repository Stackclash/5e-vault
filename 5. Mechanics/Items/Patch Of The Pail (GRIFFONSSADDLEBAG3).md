# Patch of the Pail
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Patch-of-the-Pail.webp#right)  


This canvas patch can be magically attached to a piece of clothing by pressing it against the clothing for 1 minute. The patch remains on the clothing until you remove it. While it's attached to a piece of clothing, the patch's water design magically reshapes itself to always remain level.

You can remove this patch as an action. When you do, choose one of the following effects:

## Bail

You magically move up to 30 gallons of water that you can see within 30 feet of you. The water must come from open containers. The affected water vanishes from its container and reappears 10 feet above a space that you can see within 30 feet of you, as if poured from an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] bucket.

## Douse

You extinguish all exposed, nonmagical flames of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.

Once a patch has been removed from a piece of clothing it's attached to, the patch loses its magic and becomes a mundane patch. If the magic patch is removed from a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Robe Of Useful Items.md\|robe of useful items]], the patch has a 50 percent chance to keep its magical properties and can be reattached to a piece of clothing again.
