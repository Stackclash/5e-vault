# Shadow Dye
*Potion, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

You may spend your action to pour this dye on yourself. If you do so, you take on a semi-corporeal shadowy form for the next hour. During this time, you gain a vulnerability to radiant damage and resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. In addition, so long as you are within dim light or darkness, you may take the Hide action as a bonus action, and you make Dexterity (Stealth) checks at advantage.
