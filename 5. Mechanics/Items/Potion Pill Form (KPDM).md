# Potion, Pill Form


> [!note]
> Rarity varies by potion type

Alkemancers have mastered the craft of condensing potions into pills. Potions in pill form have the same effect as regular potions and have the same color as the potions they're derived from, but an individual pill has effectively no weight and can be concealed very easily in a boot, pouch, hatband, or secret pocket. A pill can be swallowed as a bonus action. A potion in pill form costs five times as much as the regular version of the potion.
