This dagger once belonged to an infamous lamian assassin and features a sculpted metal face at the base of the blade. When you attune to this weapon, the metal face magically changes to match your appearance. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The dagger has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. When you hit a humanoid with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to immediately recreate the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Disguise Self.md\|disguise self]] spell (save DC 15), taking on the appearance of the target. When you do, the dagger's metal face changes to match the appearance. This version of the spell allows you to seem up to 3 feet shorter or taller when taking on the target's appearance.

When you take on a creature's appearance in this way, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and all ability checks as long as it can see you while you share its appearance in this way.
