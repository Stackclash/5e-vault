This heavy, dark wood is incredibly strong and forms part of the symbiotic relationship it shares with destructive beetles that live inside. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, some of the sword's beetles leave the weapon and latch onto the target. The beetles bite and hinder the creature for its next `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) turns. While affected by the beetles in this way, the creature takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns and its movement speed is halved. A creature can use an action to swat away and remove the beetles to end the effect early. If the target is a plant creature or magical plant, this property deals the maximum damage to it on each of its turns and lasts for 4 turns unless ended early by a creature.
