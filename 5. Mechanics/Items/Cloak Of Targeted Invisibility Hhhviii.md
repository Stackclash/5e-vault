# Cloak of Targeted Invisibility
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this cloak, you may spend your bonus action to force one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, magic clouds its senses and you become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible\|invisible]] to that creature for the next minute. This invisibility ends if you damage that creature in any way or you target another creature with this ability.
