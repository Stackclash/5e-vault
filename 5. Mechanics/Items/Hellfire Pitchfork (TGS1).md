- **Range**: 15/45
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]

This menacing, black iron trident is warm to the touch, weighs 10 pounds, and has the heavy property. As a result of its weight, this trident has a normal throwing range of 15 feet and a long range of 45 feet. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage to any target it hits. While the trident is within 60 feet of you, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to disappear in a puff of smoke and reappear in one of your open hands. If you speak the trident's command word immediately after making a ranged attack with it, it erupts in a 5-foot-high pillar of flame, instead of smoke, before it reappears in your hand. Any creature within the same space as the trident when it erupts in this way must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage.
