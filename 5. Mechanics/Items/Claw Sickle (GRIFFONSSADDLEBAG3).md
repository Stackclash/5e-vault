# Claw Sickle
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Sickle.md\|sickle]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement by a creature cursed with lycanthropy)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Claw-Sickle.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can benefit from this magic weapon's following properties even if you aren't attuned to it. The sickle deals `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) slashing damage on a hit, instead of `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`), and if you're wielding a claw sickle in either hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

If you're attuned to a claw sickle, you also gain a +1 bonus to any attack or damage rolls you make with any claw sickles you're holding.
