# Wild Dice
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wild-Dice.webp#right)  


This set of two chipped and weathered wood six-sided dice are infused with unpredictable magic. They come in a small velvet bag whose pattern changes based on the dice's last roll. Otherwise, the dice appear completely unassuming.

The dice have a total of 6 charges and regain `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 of their charges to roll them, tossing them at a point you can see within 30 feet of you when you do. The dice's effect is determined by the total of the roll as listed in the table and described below. Unless the effect says otherwise, the dice disappear at the end of the effect and reappear in the pouch at the start of the following turn. Rolling the dice again while an effect is still active does nothing. An effect that requires a saving throw has a DC of 15.

`dice: [[Wild Dice (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^2-effect]]`

| dice: 2d6 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 2 | Slither. The dice elongate and their dots become a sinister yellow. Each die turns into a poisonous snake, which remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. A snake attacks the closest target to it other than you and the other snake. |
| 3 | Nullify. The sound of clattering chimes follow the dice as they roll before sounding like shattering glass when they come to a stop. A magic-nullifying field bursts forth from the dice in a 30-foot sphere, centered on the point where they landed. The field lasts until the start of your next turn. For the duration, all spells and magical effects of 3rd level and lower within the sphere are dispelled or fail, and any rare, uncommon, or common magic items in the area cease to function for the duration. The dice are then lost until the next dawn, at which point they reappear in the velvet bag. |
| 4 | Slick. Slippery oil begins to seep out of the cracks in the dice, casting the grease spell from them centered on the point where they landed. |
| 5 | Misty. The dice begin to spew a dense mist, casting the fog cloud spell from them (no concentration required) centered on the point where they landed. |
| 6 | Jelly. The dice ripple and jiggle, then dissolve into a pale slime. At the start of your next turn, the slime grows into a gelatinous cube with half its normal hit points in an unoccupied space nearest to the point where the dice landed. This cube remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it melts away. The dice are then lost until the next dawn, at which point they reappear in the velvet bag. |
| 7 | Lucky. Seven shiny gold coins materialize and clatter loudly to the ground around the dice. In addition, the next attack roll or ability check you make before the end of your next turn is made with advantage. |
| 8 | Bramble. The dice crack open like seeds and grow into gnarled brambles, casting the entangle spell from them (no concentration required) centered on the point where they landed. The dice are then lost until the next dawn, at which point they reappear in the velvet bag. |
| 9 | Alarm. As the dice come to a halt, an ear-piercing alarm rings out from them for 1 minute, audible out to a range of 300 feet. Any sleeping creatures within that range are immediately awakened, and every creature that can hear the alarm is immune to any effect that would put it to sleep for the duration. |
| 10 | Revelry. The silence spell is cast from the dice (no concentration required) centered on the point where they landed. This version of the spell functions the same as a normal silence spell, but creates a sphere wherein the only sound that can be heard in the area is loud tavern music and the sounds of cheering patrons for the duration. Other sounds made within the sphere are seemingly drowned out by the revelry. |
| 11 | Zap. The dice pop and crackle with electricity. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the point where the dice landed are struck by lightning, which originates from the dice. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 12 | Explode. The dice glow red hot and smoke before detonating into a fiery blaze, as if by the fireball spell centered on the point where they landed. The dice are then lost until the next dawn, at which point they reappear in the velvet bag. |
