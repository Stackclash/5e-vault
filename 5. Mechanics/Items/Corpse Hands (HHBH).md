# Corpse Hands
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

As can be gleaned from this herb's morbid name, corpse hands resemble a rotting hand rising from the swamp waters like it was raised in some poor soul's final act of desperation. In actuality, corpse hands are mangrove-like roots and are even more macabre than they look. They are actually a carnivorous plant that produces an oil on the "palm" of its hand. This oil is incredibly necrotic, and any insect that touches it begins to rot immediately as the hand closes around it for the plant to digest. Good harvesters know how to extract and treat this oil however, and use it for more nefarious means.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A weapon that has had this herb applied to it is considered magical and deals an additional `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage upon its first successful hit in a turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
