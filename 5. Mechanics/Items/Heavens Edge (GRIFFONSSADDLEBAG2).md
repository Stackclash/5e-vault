# Heaven's Edge
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Dagger.md\|dagger]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Heavens-Edge.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This ornate dagger is made of multiple pieces that magically hover together, but move as if they were solidly connected. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) radiant damage to any creature it hits. This extra damage increases to `dice:4d4|noform|avg` (`4d4`) radiant damage if the creature is a fiend or undead.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a fiend, the target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is banished, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Banishment.md\|banishment]] spell. This version of the spell doesn't require concentration but ends early if you become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] or die within the next minute. On a successful save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the start of your next turn and isn't banished.
