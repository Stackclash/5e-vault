# Crackle Bark
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

When a tree saturated in a magical environment is struck by lightning, there is a chance for its bark to react by absorbing the raw electrical energy and thus saving the tree from destruction. As part of this, the bark becomes pitch black, but radiates a blue glow. It can be scraped off in sizable sheets and used to wrap one's weapon, imparting it with the power of lightning itself.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A weapon that has had this herb applied to it is considered magical and deals an additional `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) lightning damage upon its first successful hit in a turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
