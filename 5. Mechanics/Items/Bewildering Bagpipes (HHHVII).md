# Bewildering Bagpipes
*Wondrous item, instrument, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bagpipes.md\|bagpipes]] creates a sound similar to that of a grung's chirr when used. If a bard uses this instrument as a spellcasting focus while attempting to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Cast%20a%20Spell\|cast a spell]] that would impose the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charm]] condition on a target, the range of that spell is doubled.
