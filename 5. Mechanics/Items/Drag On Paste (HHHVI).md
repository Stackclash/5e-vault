You may spend 1 minute applying a dose of this paste to yourself. For the next 24 hours, or until the paste is washed off, you have advantage on any Charisma checks made when interacting with creatures with the dragon subtype, as well as disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks made to hide from creatures with the dragon subtype. This item has enough paste for 5 doses.
