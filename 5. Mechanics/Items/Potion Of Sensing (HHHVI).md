# Potion of Sensing
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you gain the ability to sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of you that is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] or on the Ethereal Plane. You can pinpoint such a creature that is moving. This incredibly fishy smelling potion is a sickly purple colour with cloudy segments that take a more distinct shape when you hold it and imagine things.
