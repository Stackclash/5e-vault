# Gem of Teleportation
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This gem has 5 charges. While holding this gem, you may spend your action and 1 charge in order to teleport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. This gem regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) charges at dawn.

Alternatively, you may use 5 charges to cast the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md\|plane shift]] through the gem with the plane of Gehenna as your destination. If used in this way, the gem dissolves into a useless black ichor and is destroyed.
