# Codex Dryadalis
*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/codex-dryadalis.jpg#right)  


A human adopted as an infant by elves, Irllyn Ffwllyg en Orrell ce Yth went on to become the Ganarajyan Empire's greatest authority on the fae, their magic, and their casual association with cause and effect.

Because she was a mortal wizard, she understood the rules that constrained the use of magic. Because she was raised as an elf, she had the mind of a fae. Because she was the greatest wizard of her time, she was able to synthesize these two antithetical philosophies into one coherent masterwork and thereby change the world forever. The elves never allowed this again.

## The Word for World Is Wode

After spending 1 year in a tower while in a forest, the forest transforms into a wode ^[Wodes are elf-haunted forests where the Law of Time has not yet encroached. You don't have to use wodes, you can just imagine there are a handful of spooky elf forests in your setting where weird Rip Van Winkle / Epimenides / Peter Klaus stuff is known to happen.]. This transformation is gradual, and if you leave the forest during this period the forest reverts to its original state. Once the transformation is complete, you can attract elven units as though you were an elf, and the wode begins to disobey cause and effect.

Whenever you exit your wode, you can choose to emerge from any other wode. Likewise, you can access your tower's wode from any wode.

Furthermore, when exiting your wode, you can choose to emerge in any *age* in the past or future ^[Yeah. You can travel in time. I know this is crazy, but this is what the book does. I don't make the rules!]. Returning to your own time is tricky and usually requires entering another wode.

## To Serve Us

After spending 1 year in study in a tower in a wode, you choose a pack of seven mundane beasts of the same species, raising their Intelligence score to 11 and all other attribute scores to 10 or more. They become Medium bipedal creatures and gain the Sylvan language.

The wode is their home, but they are under no compulsion to remain in it, though they do prefer it. They are your followers, and like all followers they are independent creatures with their own will.

## The Inconsequent

You cease aging and no longer need to sleep. You cannot be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], and magic cannot put you to sleep. You are immune to the effects of [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Slow.md\|slow]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Time Stop.md\|time stop]]. You are immune to the effects of [[5. Mechanics/Items/The Chronos Codex (SAF).md\|the chronos codex]].

## Motivate Trees

Once per month as an action, you can transform a copse of trees into a unit of [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Treants (SAF).md\|treants]]. The treants serve you for 1 hour or two battles, whichever happens first, after which they root back into the ground and become normal trees again.
