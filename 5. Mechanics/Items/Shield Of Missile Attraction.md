# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/shield-of-missile-attraction.webp#right]]  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

## Curse

This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
