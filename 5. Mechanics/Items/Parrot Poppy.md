# Parrot Poppy
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A bright flower that comes in a wide variety of red, blue, yellow, and green shades, much like its namesake animal. Regardless of its actual colour, the stem boasts a number of hollow seed pods that when shaken or blown in the wind, produces a perfect mimicry of a certain sound usually found on a coast. How these seed pods manage to find these sounds is unknown, but it is widely believed that they are used to attract animals and other pollinators to themselves.

## Effect:

As an action, you may shake this herb, causing it to emit a sound that is audible up to 100 feet away. This sound is randomly determined by rolling a `dice: d6|avg|noform` (`d6`) each dawn as shown in the table below. A creature hearing this sound may make a DC 12 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) check to determine if it is a mimicry or not.
