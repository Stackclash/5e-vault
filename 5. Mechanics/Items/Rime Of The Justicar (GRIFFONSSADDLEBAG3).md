# Rime of the Justicar
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Glaive.md\|glaive]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Rime-of-the-Justicar.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

The icy blade of this glaive has been formed atop a ruined spear haft. A tattered emblem hangs at its side.

The weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take cold or fire damage while holding this magic weapon, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges and gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn, including against the triggering damage. For the duration, the first target you hit with the glaive takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold damage from the attack.

## Hateful Storm

While holding the glaive, you can use a bonus action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleet Storm.md\|sleet storm]] spell (save DC 15) with the following changes:

- The spell remains centered on you and swirls around you in a sphere. It affects all other creatures within 10 feet of you, instead of its normal area.  
- You are immune to the spell's effects.  
- A creature only makes the saving throw against the storm's effects on its turn, even if the storm enters its space on your turn.  
- For the duration, the first time you hit a creature on each of your turns with the glaive, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold damage.  
- The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the glaive. When you take damage while [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentrating]] on the spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the weapon's charges and roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`), adding the number rolled to the Constitution saving throw you make to maintain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] on the spell.  

This property of the weapon can't be used again until the next dawn.
