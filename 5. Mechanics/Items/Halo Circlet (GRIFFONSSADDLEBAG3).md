# Halo Circlet
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Halo-Circlet.webp#right)  


This lustrous, gilded circlet hovers just above your head while worn. The inside of the circlet radiates with a golden glow, like a halo. While wearing it, you can speak, read, and write Celestial. In addition, you can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn. When you do, a pair of glimmering wings of golden light appear just behind your back for the duration.

While wearing the circlet, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in celestial energy whenever you take fire damage, necrotic damage, or radiant damage from a hostile source. When you do, you have resistance to that damage type, including the triggering damage, until the start of your next turn. You also gain a secondary effect that depends on the type of damage dealt:

- Fire damage. The triggering fire damage is quartered, instead of halved.  
- Necrotic damage. The first target you hit with an attack on your next turn takes an extra `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) necrotic damage from the attack.  
- Radiant damage. You can use a bonus action to restore `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) hit points to a creature you touch on your next turn.  

## Divine Opposition

If you're a tiefling and are wearing the circlet, you can choose to deal radiant damage, instead of fire damage, whenever you would deal fire damage to a target. In addition, you can use a bonus action to release a wave of beautiful, discordant energy from the circlet. The wave affects up to 8 creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. You choose if an affected creature is either affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bless.md\|bless]] spell or is forced to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; on a failed save, it's affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bane.md\|bane]] spell instead. These spells end at the start of your next turn, and any creature affected by them adds or subtracts `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) from its rolls, respectively, instead of `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`). Once this bonus action has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
