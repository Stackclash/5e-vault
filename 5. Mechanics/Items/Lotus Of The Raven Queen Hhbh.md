# Lotus of the Raven Queen
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

Also known as the black lotus, this exceptionally rare herb is found in the darkest and most foreboding places imaginable, most likely due to their stronger resonance with the negative energy of the Shadowfell. The dark petals of the lotus have a peculiar shape that make them resemble the beaks of ravens, and when brewed into a tea, they create an elixir that can put a stopper on death itself.

## Effect:

For the next 24 hours after using this herb, if you suffer a death saving throw failure, you may spend 1 hit die in order to negate that failure instead. You must spend 1 hit die per failure that you wish to negate in the event that an effect would cause you to lose more than 1 at a time.
