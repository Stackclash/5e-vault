This thick book is bound with white leather and is freezing cold to the touch. This book can be used as a spellbook and contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you're attuned to the book: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cone Of Cold.md\|cone of cold]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Otilukes Freezing Sphere.md\|freezing sphere]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ice Storm.md\|ice storm]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Energy.md\|protection from energy]] (cold damage only), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleet Storm.md\|sleet storm]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Ice.md\|wall of ice]].

The book also has 7 charges. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. While the book is on your person, you can expend 1 or more of its charges for use with the following properties:

## Cold Casting

You can expend 1 or more charges from the book in place of using spell slots when casting one of the book's icy spells. For each charge you spend as part of casting a spell in this way, the level of the spell slot you need to expend to cast it is reduced by 1. You can use an action to cast one of the book's spells, even if you didn't prepare it, provided you use only charges to cast it in this way.

## Freeze Over

When a creature that you can see (including yourself) takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the book's charges to change the damage's type to cold.

## Icy Armor

You can use an action to expend up to 3 of the book's charges to coat yourself in a magical frozen barrier. You gain 10 temporary hit points for each expended charge, and when a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, that creature takes 10 cold damage for each spent charge.
