# Vagrant's Wrist Stiletto
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Vagrants-Wrist-Stiletto.webp#right)  


This single bracer has a hidden compartment on its underside. Within it lies a thin blade, which can be magically extended from the bracer on your turn (no action required, or as part of the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action) or retracted again using a bonus action. While the blade is extended, it can be used as a magic dagger, but only if that hand is empty. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this dagger, which can't be thrown, and you are considered to be holding it while it is extended.

If you're a rogue and extend the blade from the bracer as part of the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, you can use your Sneak Attack when you make an attack with the magic dagger this turn even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it. When you deal your Sneak Attack damage in this way, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

A creature inspecting the bracer to find the hidden dagger while it's retracted must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check in order to discover it.
