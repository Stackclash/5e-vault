# Dust of Sneezing and Choking
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/dust-of-sneezing-and-choking.webp#right]]  


Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dust Of Disappearance.md\|dust of disappearance]], and an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] spell can also end the effect on a creature.
