# Psionic Oil
*Oil, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

You may spend 1 hour rubbing this weapon oil on any nonmagical weapon to irreversibly transform it into your bonded psychic weapon. A bonded psychic weapon is considered magical and has the following properties:

- If you score a critical hit on your attack roll with this weapon, you deal an additional `dice: 1d6|avg|noform` (`1d6`) psychic damage to all creatures of your choice within 5 feet of your original target (this damage is not doubled).  
- You are aware of the location of your bonded psychic weapon at all times so long as you are on the same plane of existence, and if you are within 30 feet of it and it is within line of sight, you may use your bonus action to mentally call it to you, causing it to fly to your hand by the safest route possible.  

You may only have one bonded psychic weapon at a time. If you attempt to bond to another weapon, your connection to the original is lost and it instead becomes a magic weapon that any creature may attune to in order to utilize its special properties.
