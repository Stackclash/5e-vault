# Grave Trodders
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Grave-Trodders.webp#right)  


While wearing these boots, you have resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, the boots have 5 charges and regain `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action while touching a corpse with your foot or standing no more than 10 feet above its grave to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Dead.md\|speak with dead]] spell on it. If more than one corpse is directly below you, the closest one is affected by the spell.

This version of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Dead.md\|speak with dead]] spell has the following changes:

- Instead of asking a corpse five questions, you instead expend 1 charge whenever you ask it a question. When the boots are reduced to 0 charges and the corpse has finished answering the last question it was asked, the spell ends. The spell ends early if you use the boots to ask a different corpse a question.  
- This version of the spell doesn't fail if the target has been affected by this spell within the last 10 days.  
- If you can't hear the corpse (such as if you're standing above its grave), you still know how the corpse responded to your question.  
- If the boots have 0 charges, they can't be used to cast the spell. If you cast the spell from the boots and don't ask the affected corpse any questions, it still expends 1 charge from the boots.
