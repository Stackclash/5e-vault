# Siege Dust
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This bag of fine brown dust contains great magical energy that can be imparted on weapons that are left to soak in its power. If a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage is left in a bath of this dust for 24 hours, it gains the following properties permanently:

- Any attack and damage roll made with this weapon is made with a +3 bonus.  
- Any attack made with this weapon to an object or structure deals double damage.  
- Any attack made with this weapon ignores an object's damage threshold if it has one.  
- If the wielder of this weapon moves at least 15 feet straight towards a target and then hits them with a melee weapon attack with this weapon, that target suffers an extra `dice: 4d8|avg` (`4d8`) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked [[/5.
