# Blight Oil
*Oil, common, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This bottle contains enough oil to cover up to 10 square feet of surface area. Once this oil is rubbed into the surface of vegetation, it will soak half a foot into it. Vegetation soaked in this oil becomes as soft and malleable as wet clay and retains any physical manipulation done to it.

The oil dries after 10 minutes, causing the vegetation it was rubbed on to become solid again.
