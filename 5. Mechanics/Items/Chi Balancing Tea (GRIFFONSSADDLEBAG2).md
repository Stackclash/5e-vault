# Chi-Balancing Tea
*Potion, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Chi-Balancing-Tea.webp#right)  


This potion is specially brewed by the monks of Durheim using a unique leaf found only in their gardens. The tea remains magically warm while inside its traditional porcelain bottle. The potion's flavor is deep and smoky, and leaves a sour aftertaste like the air after a storm.

When you drink this potion, it cures any short-term madness afflicting you, and if you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], it ends those conditions. In addition, if you have 2 or more levels in the monk class, you regain `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended ki points.
