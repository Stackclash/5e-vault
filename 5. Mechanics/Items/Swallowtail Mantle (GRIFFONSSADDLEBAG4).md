# Swallowtail Mantle
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Swallowtail-Mantle.webp#right)  


While wearing this mantle, when you move 10 or more feet before jumping, the maximum distance of your jump is increased by 10 feet. In addition, when you fall at least 20 feet while wearing this mantle, you can use your reaction to grip its edges with both hands. While holding the edges, you fly at a speed of 30 feet, but cannot fly upwards without a significant updraft. Unless you're lifted by an updraft, you descend 15 feet at the end of each of your turns. If you land on the ground while flying in this way, you take no damage from falling. You lose this flying speed if you ever fail to grip the mantle's edges.
