# Gossiper's Ear Cuff
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Gossipes-Ear-Cuff.webp#right)  


While wearing this ear cuff, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Message.md\|message]] cantrip from it. In addition, you automatically hear the message of any spell that targets a creature within 120 feet of you, such as by a message or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sending.md\|sending]] spell. Messages overheard in this way sound like whispers to you, regardless of the original message.
