# Rumble Cotton
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A strain of cotton with surprisingly stiff yet supple fibres that allow the plant to resist the high winds and avalanche vibrations of its mountain home. While it is much scratchier than its field-grown counterpart, this cotton is much better at providing protection, as it can be stuffed into one's clothes in order to significantly dampen any heavy vibrations or sound based threats that may come your way.

## Effect:

You gain resistance to thunder damage for 4 hours after using this herb.
