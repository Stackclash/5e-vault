# Goggles of Night
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/goggles-of-night.webp#right]]  


While wearing these dark lenses, you have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]], wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
