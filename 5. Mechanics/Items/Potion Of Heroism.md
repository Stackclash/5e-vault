# Potion of Heroism
*Potion, minor, rare*  


For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bless.md\|bless]] spell (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
