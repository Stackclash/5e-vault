# Shield of Reflection
*Shield, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: Crafted by
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This shield has what appears to be a spectator's eye engraved in the middle of it. While wearing this shield, if you make a successful saving throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses you, you may spend your reaction to choose another creature (including the spellcaster) that you can see within 30 feet of you. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of you. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.
