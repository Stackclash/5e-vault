# Pendant of the Tempered Fury
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Pendant-of-the-Tempered-Fury.webp#right)  


This magic silvered pendant glows with a simmering flame of rage trapped inside of its clenched fist. Small sparks shoot out from between the pendant's metal fingers. The fiery anger from the pendant tightens your focus and allows you to shrug off some of the damage you take. If you are wearing no armor and using no shield while you wear this pendant, all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take is reduced by 3.

In addition, the pendant has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to ignite your hands in a magical flame. While lit, your arms and hands cast bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet, and your unarmed attacks deal an additional `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) fire damage to any target they hit. Your hands remain lit for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to quench them.

Any flame created by the pendant, whether it be on your hands or on the pendant itself, is harmless to you. While your hands are wreathed in fire in this way, your unarmed strikes are considered magical.
