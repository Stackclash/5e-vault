# Staff of the Four Seasons
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-the-Four-Seasons.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magical staff changes with the seasons. You can spend 10 minutes concentrating on the staff to change it to a different season. It remains in this new form for the next 8 hours before reverting to the current season again.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, your melee attacks with the staff deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold (Winter), radiant (Spring), fire (Summer), or necrotic (Autumn) damage based on its season as long as there is at least 1 charge remaining on the staff.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (depending on its season) using your spell attack modifier and spell save DC:

## Winter

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Color Spray.md\|Color spray]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Darkvision.md\|darkvision]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleet Storm.md\|sleet storm]] (3 charges)

## Spring

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Guiding Bolt.md\|Guiding bolt]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Moonbeam.md\|moonbeam]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plant Growth.md\|plant growth]] (3 charges)

## Summer

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Burning Hands.md\|Burning hands]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spike Growth.md\|spike growth]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] (3 charges)

## Autumn

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|Inflict wounds]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Pass Without Trace.md\|pass without trace]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] (3 charges)

The staff regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff loses all foliage and vitality, becoming a gnarled, nonmagical quarterstaff.
