# Stamp of Shipping
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Stamp-of-Shipping.webp#right)  


This wooden stamp has a hollow opening at the top of its handle. You can use an action to stamp an object with the stamp, at which point it's magically teleported to another location. When you stamp the object, you name the location (which you must have visited) and a recipient who matches a general description. To be eligible, an object must be Small or smaller and weigh no more than 25 pounds; it also can't be worn or carried or create its own extradimensional space. The location must also be within 100 miles of you.

To stamp an object, you must first place an amount of gold in the top of the stamp using an action. The amount of gold required depends on the weight of the package, as well as the distance it's teleported. Use the table below to determine the object's cost based on its weight, then use the second column to multiply it based on the distance the object will travel.

| Weight | Distance Teleported |
|--------|---------------------|
| Up to 1 pound (5 gp) | Up to 10 miles (gp × 1); 1 day travel time |
| 1–2 pounds (10 gp) | Up to 25 miles (gp × 2); 2 days travel time |
| 3–5 pounds (15 gp) | Up to 50 miles (gp × 3); 3 days travel time |
| 6–10 pounds (20 gp) | Up to 100 miles (gp × 4); 4 days travel time |
| 11–15 pounds (25 gp) | — |
| 16–25 pounds (30 gp) | — |

You can halve the travel time by doubling the gold required. The amount of gold required is also doubled if the object is magical. At the GM's discretion, a stamped object may not be teleported; the spent gold is then thrust back out from the stamp. The stamp creates its own ink.

An object vanishes once it's stamped. It reappears at the named location at the end of the travel time. If an object can't be delivered, or if the location is farther than the paid-for distance would allow, it's returned to the location where it was originally stamped instead, and the gold is wasted.
