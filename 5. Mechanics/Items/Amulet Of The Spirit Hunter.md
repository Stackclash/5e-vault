# Amulet of the Spirit Hunter
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this amulet, you may use your action to speak the amulet's command word and transform yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying into a spiritual version of yourself for the next hour. If you drop anything, they return to their regular form immediately. While in spiritual form, you have the following benefits:

- You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) force damage if you end your turn inside an object.  
- Your weapon attacks deal psychic damage instead of their usual bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage and are considered magical.  
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.  
- You have a fly speed equal to your speed.  

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
