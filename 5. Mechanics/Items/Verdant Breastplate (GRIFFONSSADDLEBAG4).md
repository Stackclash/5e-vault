# Verdant Breastplate
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Breastplate.md\|breastplate]]), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Verdant-Breastplate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

When found, this breastplate resembles a leather cuirass covered in large, dried leaves. Once you wear and attune to it, however, it springs to life and flourishes; its leaves remain pliable and flexible, but harden against incoming harm to protect you. Sleeping in this armor has no adverse effect on you.

While wearing this armor, moving through nonmagical plants that impede movement (such as by creating difficult terrain) costs you no extra movement, and you don't take damage from nonmagical plant hazards such as thorns or spines. In addition, the entangle spell has no effect on you, and you have advantage on any Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) check you make to hide in areas of dense foliage.

## Charges

This armor has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you're a druid or ranger and have cast the plant growth spell from the armor within the last 24 hours, the armor regains all expended charges instead.

## Spells

While wearing this armor, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Entangle.md\|entangle]] (1 charges) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plant Growth.md\|plant growth]] (3 charges) spell from it, using a spell save DC of 15. If you're a druid or ranger, you can choose to cast the spell from the armor using your spell save DC instead.

When you cast plant growth using this armor, the plants affected by the spell are enriched for 30 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
