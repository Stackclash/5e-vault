# Sword of Wounding
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  


Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Medicine\|Medicine]]) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.
