Arkanotars are weapons from a far-flung age and can sometimes be found in the lairs of sphinxes that have traveled through time. They always come in pairs, and can only be used when worn together. It takes an action to don or doff the arkanotars.

The item appears to be a pair of gauntlet-like devices. While wearing them on your hands, you can use a bonus action to cause an electrical blade to spring forth from them, or make them disappear. For the duration, the blade only persists while your hands are clenched into fists. The blades emit bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which deal lightning damage instead of piercing damage. Due to their worn nature, these weapons lack the thrown property. For the first time on each of your turns when you hit the same target twice using the blades, that target also takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) lightning damage. When a target takes this extra lightning damage, you can choose to overload it with electrical force: doing so causes tendrils of lightning to lash out at other creatures within 10 feet of the target. Each creature within that area (excluding yourself) must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) lightning damage. If a creature is made of metal or is wearing metal armor, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

The weapon runs on a power source that's fueled by magic. The weapons' blades can persist for up to 1 hour before the power source is empty. Deduct the time it persists in increments of 1 minute from the power source's total time. You know how much remaining time the source has while holding the weapons. Any creature can use an action to expend a spell slot level of 1st level or higher into the power source, adding to its total remaining time, by touching either arkanotar as the spell slot is expended. The power source regains a number of minutes of power equal to the spell slot level that was expended into it. When found, a pair of arkanotars have `dice:3d20|noform|avg` (`3d20`) minutes of power remaining, and it can't have more than 60 minutes of power at a time.

## Lightning Bolt

You can use an action to rub the two weapons together and use them to punch forwards, duplicating the effects of the lightning bolt spell when you do (save DC 16). Doing so deducts 10 minutes from the weapons' remaining time, and this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
