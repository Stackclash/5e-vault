# Amulet of the Coldfire Phoenix
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Amulet-of-the--Coldfire-Phoenix.webp#right)  


A blue pendant in the shape of a phoenix clutching a shimmering blue orb hangs from this leather cord. While wearing the necklace, you emit a frigid aura that grants you and creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you resistance to cold damage.

In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing the necklace but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do, you gain 25 temporary hit points. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, that creature takes 25 cold damage. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 3 days have passed.
