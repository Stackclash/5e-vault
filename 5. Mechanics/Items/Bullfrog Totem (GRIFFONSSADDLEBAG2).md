# Bullfrog Totem
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bullfrog-Totem.webp#right)  


The magical fey spirit of a bullfrog inhabits this mosscovered stone statue. A creature that can see invisible objects can see this spirit swimming through the air around the statue. The statue is 9 inches tall and weighs 3 pounds. Harmless, mundane insects such as flies, gnats, and mosquitos are magically repelled from the statue in a 30-foot-radius sphere that remains centered on it.
