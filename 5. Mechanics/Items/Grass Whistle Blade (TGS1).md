This dagger's blade is actually a large, enchanted blade of grass. As wind passes over the blade, it creates a soft, sweet note that magically begins to lull creatures to sleep. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This blade has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this dagger, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges and forgo the attack's damage to attempt to put the creature to sleep. When you do, you swing the blade in a pattern around the creature that creates a magical lullaby. Roll `dice:10d8|noform|avg` (`10d8`); the total is how many hit points of the creature this can affect. If the total number of hit points you roll is greater than the target's remaining hit points, that creature falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for 1 minute or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake or slap that creature awake. If the target is not put to sleep, it takes `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) psychic damage instead.

Undead and creatures immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] can't be put to sleep by this effect.
