# Elven Leaf
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

A well known and ubiquitous herb picked from scraggly bushes and used to make a calming tea. A commonly held myth is that elven leaf is named as such due to its large consumption by elves which in turn leads to their infamously serene demeanoursâ€”this is in fact false. Elven leaf is actually named as a derogatory reference to the elven ear, due to also having a distinctively sharp triangle shape. Due to this, there is a movement in some circles to change the name of this herb to something with less offensive references.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you gain a sense of calm that inhibits your ability to experience large spikes in emotions. During this time, you have advantage on any ability check or saving throw to resist being affected by the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|fear]] condition.
