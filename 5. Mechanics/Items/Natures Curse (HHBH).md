# Nature's Curse
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

While there are many dangerous and toxic plants in the world, the aptly named Nature's Curse makes their effects seem like nothing more than a mild case of hayfever. Every part of this horrid tree contains its toxic sap, from its fig-like fruits, to its rough leaves, to its weeping bark. To even touch the sap is to know pain like no other, as burning blisters and debilitating muscle aches immediately set in. In places where this tree grows, simply owning a vial of this sap is considered a crime as it has literally no use other than to enact utmost cruelty upon another creature.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) charges. To use this herb, you must expend one charge to cover one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition in its toxic sap. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit by this weapon or ammunition must succeed a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the creature is wracked with horrible pain, causing them to have disadvantage on all saving throws, have their movement speed halved, and any spell they are concentrating on automatically ends at the start of their turn.
