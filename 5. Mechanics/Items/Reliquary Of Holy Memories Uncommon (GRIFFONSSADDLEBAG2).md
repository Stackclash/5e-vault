# Reliquary of Holy Memories (Uncommon)
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]]), rod, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Reliquary-of-Holy-Memories.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning

This scepter holds the bones of a powerful martyred saint and are said to contain the echoes of their memories. The rod can also be used as a magic [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]].

While attuned to this rod, you can prepare one additional spell for each bone held within the rod, up to a maximum of 5. The rarity of the reliquary is determined by the number of bones inside. The uncommon variant of this item contains 1–2 bones, and you can prepare 1–2 extra spells while attuned to it.
