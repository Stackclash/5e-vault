# Nimblewrap Roll
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Nimblewrap-Roll.webp#right)  


A nimblewrap roll is a roll of gauze, leather, or fabric detailed with flowing patterns. The roll can be wound around the handle of a weapon over the course of 1 minute to magically grant it the finesse property, as the weapon's movements become smooth and fluid, provided that the weapon doesn't have the two handed, heavy, or special property. The roll can be applied in this way to a mundane weapon or a common magic weapon without any risk of failure. However, magic weapons of higher rarities may not accept the roll's enchantment, removing the roll's magic properties on a failure: uncommon (20 percent failure chance), rare (60 percent), very rare (80 percent), or legendary (90 percent). The roll automatically fails when applied to artifacts.

You can remove the roll from a weapon over the course of 1 minute.
