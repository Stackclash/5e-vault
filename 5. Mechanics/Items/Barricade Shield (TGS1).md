# Barricade Shield
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Barricade-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this sturdy iron shield, you can use an action to plant it on the ground and expand its height and width to stretch up to 15 feet across in either direction, potentially becoming a defensive wall or similar platform. The edges of the shield magically conform to fit the shape of an enclosed space, such as the walls of a tunnel or hallway. While holding the expanded shield in place, your speed becomes 0 and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Regardless of the shield's size, its weight always remains the same.

The expanded shield is considered a nonmagical structure that has an AC of 14 and 40 hit points. The shield can remain expanded for up to 1 minute before it reverts back to its normal size. The expanded shield reverts early (but is not destroyed) if it reaches 0 hit points or moves. If you're holding the expanded shield, you can choose to revert it early using a bonus action.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
