# Ring of Evasion
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/ring-of-evasion.webp#right]]  


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
