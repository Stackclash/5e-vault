# Time Warden Helm
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Time-Warden-Helm.webp#right)  


This helmet has a monocle-like glass clock over its left eye. While wearing it, you always know what time it is. In addition, the helmet allows you to catch glimpses of the near future: you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Surprised\|surprised]] while you're not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]], and you have advantage on initiative rolls.

## Forewarning

While wearing the helmet, you can use a bonus action to see the immediate future, granting yourself advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn. For the duration, your speed also increases by 10 feet, and other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you. If this is the first time that the property has been used since dawn, you needn't make a saving throw; otherwise, you must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of the effect. On a failed save, a wave of lethargy sweeps over you: you can't move or take actions for the rest of your turn, and this property of the helmet can't be used again until the next dawn.

The save DC is equal to 10 plus the number of times this property has been used since dawn. For example, the first time this saving throw is made each day, the DC would be 12, since the property would have been used twice. If you're also wearing the time warden armor, you have advantage on the saving throw.
