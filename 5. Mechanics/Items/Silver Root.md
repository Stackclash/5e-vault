# Silver Root
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

In areas suffused with magic, plantlife often mimics the properties of the elements around it, and dig sites are no exceptions. Usually found in mines with traces of magic, silver root is exactly what it sounds likeâ€”a root made of silver (or partially at least). Although the silver contained within is considered useless as a metal due to it resembling an organic plant, it is still valuable as a component in weapon oils and is favoured by anyone hunting shapeshifters or other magically protected creatures.

## Effect:

As part of preparing this herb you must apply it to a melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. If you do so, for the next hour that weapon or ammunition is considered both magical and made of silver for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical and non-silver weapon attacks.
