# Potion of Infernal Vitality
*Potion, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you recover `dice:8d4+8|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d4 + 8`) hit points and you gain a fiendish constitution for the next `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) hours. During this time, you gain resistance to cold, fire, and poison damage as well as damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered. You also have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. This potion is a deep crimson and smells strongly of sulfur.
