# Icestone Trunk
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

Petrified wood occurs when a fallen tree is buried in sediment, after which a process occurs that replaces the organic material with minerals. This can even occur in frozen environments wherein a tree becomes snap frozen in the cold and hardens over time. In some exceptional circumstances (such as when a tree fell over a leyline, or perhaps was touched by a dryad at some point), magic can seep into the fallen tree as it crystallises, thereby creating icestone trunks. This magical wood contains the harshest colds inside its frozen form, and when chunks of it are used as a sharpening stone, can cause a weapon to freeze its target in solid ice.

## Effect:

As part of using this herb, you must use it to sharpen one slashing or piercing melee weapon, or up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. For the next 4 hours, this weapon or ammunition is considered magical, and whenever it successfully hits a creature, they must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw as frost attempts to cover their body. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed this saving throw. On a failed save, the affected creature's movement speed is halved and makes all Dexterity saving throws at disadvantage for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] and cannot take reactions as the frost overtakes their body. At the end of each of the creature's turns, they may make the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success. This herb may be used up to 6 times, after which its magic fades and becomes useless.
