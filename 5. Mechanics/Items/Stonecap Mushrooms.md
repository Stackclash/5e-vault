# Stonecap Mushrooms
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

These hardy grey mushrooms have the curious property of absorbing the minerals of the rocky terrain in which they grow. The result is an extremely tough shell on their cap that helps prevent them from being eaten by wandering animal foragers. However, with a proper boiling technique, these shells can be broken down and become edible, lending their durability to the imbiber (just don't plan on having a pleasant experience on the toilet the next day).

## Effect:

For 8 hours after you use this herb, any critical hits made against you are turned into normal hits and any extra effects that would be triggered by that critical hit are negated.
