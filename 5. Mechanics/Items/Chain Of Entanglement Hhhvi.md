# Chain of Entanglement
*Melee Weapon, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVI/ChainofEntanglement.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: Crafted by, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], Martial, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

You may use this weapon instead of your free hand when you make [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#grapple\|grapple]] checks. While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#grappled\|grappled]] this way, you cannot make [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#attack\|attacks]] with this weapon.

Additionally, while holding this item, you may spend an action to speak this item's command word and throw it into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. At this point, this weapon becomes magically animate and may attack and move freely for the next minute. As a bonus action on your turn, you may either mentally command the chain to move up to 20 feet in any direction or make an attack against a target within 10 feet of it. At the end of the minute or if you drop [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious\|unconscious]], the chain drops to the ground and this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.

While animate, treat this weapon as if it had 14 Strength and a +2 proficiency bonus for the sake of attack rolls, damage rolls, and grapple checks.
