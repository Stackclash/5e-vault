You may use this weapon instead of your free hand when you make grapple checks. While you have a creature grappled this way, you cannot make attacks with this weapon.

Additionally, while holding this item, you may spend an action to speak this item's command word and throw it into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. At this point, this weapon becomes magically animate and may attack and move freely for the next minute. As a bonus action on your turn, you may either mentally command the chain to move up to 20 feet in any direction or make an attack against a target within 10 feet of it. At the end of the minute or if you drop unconscious, the chain drops to the ground and this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.

While animate, treat this weapon as if it had 14 Strength and a +2 proficiency bonus for the sake of attack rolls, damage rolls, and grapple checks.
