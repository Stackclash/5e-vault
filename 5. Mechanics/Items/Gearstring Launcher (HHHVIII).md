# Gearstring Launcher
*Rare*  


This specialized weapon is fitted with an intricate series of gears that can add custom payloads to the wielder's ammunition. While holding this weapon, you may use your bonus action to load or unload an item that is no larger than 6 inches in any dimension and that weighs up to 10 pounds into the launching slot. If you have an item in the launching slot, you may choose to use your action to fire that loaded item as a specialized ammunition-head at any space or target within your weapon's normal range. If your loaded item would normally involve making an attack roll against a target, you roll that attack roll as a normal ranged weapon attack and use any effects from that loaded item instead of your normal damage roll.
