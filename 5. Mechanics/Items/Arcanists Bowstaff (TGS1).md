# Arcanist's Bowstaff
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, very rare (requires attunement by a creature with an Intelligence of 17 or higher)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Arcanists-Bowstaff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

When you attune to this quarterstaff, it remains solid in your grip but feels pliable within your mind. You can choose to use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with this weapon instead of Strength. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

When you make an attack with this magic weapon, you can choose to make the attack at range. When you do, you use your mind to telekinetically curve the quarterstaff into the form of a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Longbow.md\|longbow]]. The bow is magically strung with an arcane energy that arcs between the rings on either end of the weapon. A glowing, magical arrow is formed whenever the arcing energy is drawn back. The arrow disappears after it hits a target. When you make a ranged attack with the quarterstaff in this way, the weapon is treated as if it were a magical longbow. This longbow can only use the ammunition that it generates and does not have the heavy property. While holding this weapon, you're proficient with this longbow when using it in this way.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

In addition, this quarterstaff has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]] spell from the quarterstaff as a bonus action, instead of its normal casting time. When you do, the missiles are fired from either the bow or the quarterstaff's embossed faces.
