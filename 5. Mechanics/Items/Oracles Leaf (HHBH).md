# Oracle's Leaf
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

If one reaches the peaks of the highest mountains, you may find oracles dwelling in caves shrouded in incense. While they were usually thought to have been ordained by the gods to communicate their prophecies, it's actually more likely that it is their incense that is responsible for their fortune-telling abilities. The oracle leaf is a magical plant that grows on shrubs on mountainsides, and it has been seen that inhaling their sweet smoke actually provides powers of minor clairvoyance and heightened awareness.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you gain a minor clairvoyance that aids you in avoiding danger. Whenever you are targeted by an attack, you may use your reaction to force that attack to be made at disadvantage.
