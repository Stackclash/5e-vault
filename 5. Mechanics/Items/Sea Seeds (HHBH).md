# Sea Seeds
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A common plant resembling a cob of corn that floats on the surface of the water and is treasured by fisherman for its ability to attract fish.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) charges. As an action, you may expend one charge to scatter a number of seeds. If done into a body of water, these seeds cause all marine life in the same body of water with an Intelligence score of less than 4 and within 100 feet of them to swim to them in the most direct route possible. The fish do not attempt to eat these seeds, but are simply attracted to their location. Once they have been in the water for 1 minute, they dissolve and become useless.
