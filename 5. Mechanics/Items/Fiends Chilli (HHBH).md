# Fiend's chilli
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

An incredibly spicy variety of chilli pepper, identifiable by two distinctive nubs growing from its top resembling horns. Along with the usual bodily responses to spice, this herb also causes the eater's blood pressure and body temperature to rise, resulting in their skin taking on a bright red hue and their breath to become visible regardless of temperature. While some describe this as unpleasant, the chilli has been used by charlatans in order to trick naive villagers into thinking they are under assault by fiendish beings.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, your skin turns bright red and you constantly exhale steam.
