# Celestial Tome of Healing
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Celestial-Tome-of-Healing.webp#right)  


This golden-paged tome has a diamond embedded in its cover, which emits a soft glow whenever the book is held. The following spells are written in the book using a strange form of Celestial that's only legible to the creature attuned to it: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cure Wounds.md\|cure wounds]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Guiding Bolt.md\|guiding bolt]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Healing Word.md\|healing word]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mass Healing Word.md\|mass healing word]]. While attuned to the book, you know the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sacred Flame.md\|sacred flame]] cantrip, and you can prepare the book's spells as if they were wizard spells whenever you finish a long rest. Whenever you expend a spell slot to cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot one level higher than the level at which you cast the spell.

In addition, your connection to the book gives you magical insight to theology. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Religion\|Religion]]) checks and on ability checks regarding celestials.

When you use your Arcane Recovery feature while the book is on your person, you also regain `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) hit points for each spell slot level you expended to cast a spell from the book since the last time you finished a long rest.
