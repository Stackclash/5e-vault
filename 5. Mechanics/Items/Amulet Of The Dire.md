# Amulet of the Dire
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this amulet, you may use your action to speak its command word and grow one size larger, doubling your size in all dimensions and multiplying your weight by eight. Everything you are carrying and wearing also increases relative to you; it returns to its original size immediately if it is dropped. If there isn't enough available free space for you to grow, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available.

While enlarged in this way, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and your weapon attacks done with your enlarged weapons deal an extra `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) damage. In addition, when you use this ability, you also gain a random trollish mutation for the duration of the enlargement. Roll a `dice: d4|avg|noform` (`d4`) and consult the table below to find your mutation.

**Trollish Mutation**

`dice: [[Amulet Of The Dire.md#^trollish-mutation]]`

| dice: d4 | Mutation |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | You gain the incredible regenerative abilities of the trolls. You regain 10 hit points at the start of each of your turns so long as you start with at least 1 hit point and you have not taken any acid or fire damage since the end of your last turn. |
| 2 | You gain an extra head. You have advantage on saving throws against becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#deafened\|deafened]], and you can still function even if one of your heads is destroyed or removed from your body. |
| 3 | You gain an extra set of arms tipped with claws. As a bonus action, you may make an unarmed strike with them, dealing `dice: 1d6\|avg|noform` (`1d6`) + your Strength modifier slashing damage on a successful hit. |
| 4 | Your skin becomes green and tough, giving you a +2 bonus to AC. |
^trollish-mutation

This enlarging lasts for 1 hour, after which you return to your original size. You may also end the effect early by speaking the command word again (no action required). Once this ability has been used once, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
