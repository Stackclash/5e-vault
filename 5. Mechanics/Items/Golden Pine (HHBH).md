# Golden Pine
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A beautiful pine with leaves tinged with the golden light of the sun rising over a powdery tundra. It is said that this pine was created by [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Baphomet (MPMM).md\|Baphomet]] himself as a gift to any that needed to strike down evil dragons. The resin tapped from its mighty trunk contains a special enzyme that reacts violently with the keratin of a dragon's scales, softening them and making their flesh easier to strike. As such, these trees are revered by the dragon hunters of the land, with many of them building their mighty fortresses inside golden pine forests.

## Effect:

As an action, you may cover one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition with the resin from this plant. For the next hour, any time you use that weapon to successfully hit a creature with the dragon type, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, all attacks made against that creature are made at advantage until the start of your next turn.
