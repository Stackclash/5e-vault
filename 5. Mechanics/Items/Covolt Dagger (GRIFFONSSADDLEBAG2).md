This angular dagger is forged with covolt, an elemental blue metal that carries storm-like properties. When you score a critical hit against a target with an attack made with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) lightning damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
