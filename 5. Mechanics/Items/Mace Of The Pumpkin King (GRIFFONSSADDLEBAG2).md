# Mace of the Pumpkin King
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mace-of-the-Pumpkin-King.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic mace is actually an enchanted pumpkin whose stem is used as a handle. Its orange exterior is carved into a frightening visage with a toothy maw and unforgiving eyes. Between dusk and dawn, the pumpkin is lit from within with a magical flame that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the flame is lit, targets hit by the mace take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) fire damage, and when you roll a 20 on an attack roll with the flaming weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the start of your next turn.
