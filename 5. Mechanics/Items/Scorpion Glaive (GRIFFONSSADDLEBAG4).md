# Scorpion Glaive
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Glaive.md\|glaive]]), uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Scorpion-Glaive.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This glaive is gently curved. It magically straightens when you thrust it forward. On a hit, the weapon deals either piercing or slashing damage (your choice each time). When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] creature takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns; it can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on a success.
