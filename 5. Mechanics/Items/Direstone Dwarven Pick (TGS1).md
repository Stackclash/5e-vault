This old, weathered war pick is able to effortlessly break and mold stone. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Creatures and objects made of stone that are hit by the war pick take an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) piercing damage from the attack. In addition, the weapon has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Meld Into Stone.md\|meld into stone]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stone Shape.md\|stone shape]] spell using the weapon.
