# Viper Bracers
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a monk)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Viper-Bracers.webp#right)  


While wearing these twisted, emerald green bracers, you can use your reaction when a creature targets you with a melee attack to make two unarmed strikes against it. For each attack that hits, that creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 round, ending at the start of its turn on the round that it would end. This property of the bracers can't be used again until the next dawn.
