# Orb of Remembrance
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Orb-of-Remembrance.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

This glassy orb is 3 inches in diameter, weighs 1/2 pound, and is wrapped in a golden wire cage. Strange, wispy smoke drifts around inside the orb, creating cloud-like shapes that are almost recognizable as reallife objects.

While holding the orb, you can use an action to speak its command word, priming the orb and causing the smoke inside to restlessly billow and swirl. You can gently squeeze the primed orb (no action required) to cause it to record that moment in time around you. When you do, the glassy sphere becomes perfectly clear over the course of 1 minute and reveals an exact duplicate of the area around you in up to a 30-foot radius as a miniature, illusory diorama inside it. While holding the orb, the scene inside soundlessly replays the next 6 seconds following the diorama's capture.

An orb remains primed for 1 minute or until used to capture a diorama. Touching a primed orb of remembrance to one that already has a diorama creates a duplicate of the diorama in the primed orb. Speaking the command word again while shaking the orb causes the diorama inside to disappear into smoke, allowing it to be primed once more.
