# Musical Fruit
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Despite its name, this herb is actually a bean. It has long been favoured by bards for generations, due to the plant's mild psychedelic effect that causes the eater to become more sensitive to tones and audio frequencies, enhancing one's ability to perceive and play music. That said, usage of the herb is looked down upon by many performers who believe that using the herb is a betrayal of their art form.

## Effect:

You may eat this herb as an action. For the next hour, you have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) ability checks made to sing or play musical instruments.
