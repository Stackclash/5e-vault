# Rod of Reverberation
*Rod, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Rod-of-Reverberation.webp#right)  


This rod bears the embossed likeness of an ox at its top, where it splits into two horn-like prongs. When struck, the prongs reverberate with a magical force and electricity.

The rod has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use your reaction when another creature hits you with a melee attack to expend 1 of the rod's charges to increase your AC by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. If the attack misses you as a result of using this property, the attacker must also make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) lightning damage and `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) thunder damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and makes its next attack as normal.
