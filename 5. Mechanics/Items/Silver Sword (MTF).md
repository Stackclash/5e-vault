# Silver Sword
*Weapon, major (requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Astral Projection.md\|astral projection]] spell), you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
