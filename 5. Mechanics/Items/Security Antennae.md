# Security Antennae
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

These long blue rods are the result of applying additional enchantments to the severed antennae of a remorhaz. As an action, you may speak a command word while holding the antennae and then plant them into soft ground. For the next 8 hours, or until the antennae are removed from the ground, the antennae will mentally alert you if it detects a creature moving on or in the ground within 90 feet. When alerted in this way, you become aware of the distance and direction of the creature, its approximate size, and the speed it is moving.

When you plant the antennae in the ground, you may choose for the antennae to not alert you to creatures above or below a certain size of your choosing or creatures moving above or below a certain speed threshold. Once planted, the security antennae cannot be used again for another 16 hours.
