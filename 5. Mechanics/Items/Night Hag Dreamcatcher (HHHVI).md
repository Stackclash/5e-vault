# Night Hag Dreamcatcher
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

A creature that sleeps with their head under this item only has good dreams and are immune to any magical effect that would affect its sleep in a negative way. If two creatures sleep under this item, there is a 50 percent chance that they will enter a shared dream in which they may interact with each other freely.
