# Talisman of Annihilation
*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this talisman, you may use your bonus action to exude an aura of anti-life in a 30-foot radius around you until the start of your next turn. Any creature in the aura that attempts to recover hit points must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they recover 0 hit points instead. Undead are immune to this aura.

As an action, you may destroy this talisman by breaking it upon the ground. If you do so, the talisman bursts into a 60-foot radius sphere of anti-life, enveloping all creatures not behind total cover from the talisman. All creatures caught inside the sphere must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, suffering `dice: 12d12|avg` (`12d12`) necrotic damage on a failure, or half that on a success.

Any creature that dies either in your aura, or as a result of the anti-life sphere, explodes in a burst of negative energy, forcing all creatures adjacent to them other than you to succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage and, if they exploded due to dying in your aura, granting you advantage on attack rolls against them until the start of their next turn.
