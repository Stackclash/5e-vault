# Vorpal Sword
*Major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/vorpal-sword.webp#right]]  


You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) slashing damage from the hit.
