# Force Gauntlet
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Force-Gauntlet.webp#right)  


This jeweled gauntlet has 5 charges and regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a melee attack with a hand that's wearing this gauntlet, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack. If it hits, the target takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) force damage from the attack and must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a success, you're pushed 10 feet away from it instead. Targets two or more sizes larger than you automatically succeed on the saving throw.
