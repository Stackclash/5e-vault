This golden talisman is made of five twisting hydra heads and hung from a simple gold chain. While wearing this talisman, you gain the following benefits:

- When you use your reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can make a second attack against that same target as part of that reaction.  
- You can make an opportunity attack, even if you've already used your reaction.  
- When you are forced to make a saving throw against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]], or knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]], you can use your reaction to make the saving throw with advantage.  
- When you take more than 25 damage from a single attack or effect, you can use your reaction to regain 10 hit points. If this damage would reduce you to 0 hit points but not kill you outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead and do not regain 10 hit points.  
- When your head would be cut off by an effect, such as by a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Vorpal Sword.md\|vorpal sword]], you can use your reaction to negate the effect.  

Once a benefit of the talisman has been used, that benefit can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
