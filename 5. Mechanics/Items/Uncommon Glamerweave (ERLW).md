# Uncommon Glamerweave
*Wondrous Item, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Glamerweave is clothing imbued with harmless illusory magic. While wearing these clothes, you can use a bonus action to create a moving illusory pattern within the cloth. Alternatively, you can have the pattern rise from the cloth. For example, a glamerweave gown might be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a glamerweave hat might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it.

When you make a Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) or Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) check while wearing the glamerweave, you can roll a `dice: d4|avg` (`d4`) and add the number rolled to the check. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
