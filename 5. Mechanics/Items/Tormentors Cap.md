# Tormentor's Cap
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this cap, you may spend an action to target a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If you do so, that creature must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you learn that creature's greatest fear, and for the next 24 hours, you have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) checks made against them. In addition, if they were [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]], they also take `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) psychic damage. On a successful save, that creature becomes immune to the effects of this item and is made aware of you targeting them. This item has no effect on creatures that are immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|fear]] condition.
