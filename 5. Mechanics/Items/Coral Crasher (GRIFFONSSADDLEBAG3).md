# Coral Crasher
*Major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Coral-Crasher.webp#right)  


This axe is made of a series of corals sprouting from a metal handle. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and you don't suffer the negative effects of underwater combat when you make an attack with it

The axe has two forms: bleached and enriched. The axe is white and chalky while in its bleached form, and vibrant and colorful while in its enriched one. The axe deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) damage to any target it hits; the extra damage is slashing in its enriched form, and necrotic in its bleached form. If the enriched axe hasn't been submerged in water for at least 8 consecutive hours in the past 3 days, it changes to its bleached form. Once the bleached axe is submerged for the full duration, it becomes enriched again.

## Barrier Reef

You can use an action while holding the enriched axe to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Stone.md\|wall of stone]] spell from it (save DC 15). If you're underwater, you can cast the spell using a bonus action instead. This version of the spell creates a wall of vibrant coral reefs, instead of stone. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:10d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d6`) slashing damage from the sharp reefs on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that touches the reef with its body for the first time on a turn takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) slashing damage from it. The wall vanishes at the end of the spell's duration. Once this property has been used, the axe changes to its bleached form, and the property can't be used again until the next dawn.
