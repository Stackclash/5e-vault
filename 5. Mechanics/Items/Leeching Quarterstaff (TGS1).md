You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This quarterstaff has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a target with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to siphon away some of the target's life force to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) necrotic damage with the attack. You regain health equal the amount of necrotic damage dealt in this way. This property has no effect on undead creatures or constructs.
