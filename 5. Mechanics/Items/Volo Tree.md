# Volo Tree
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

Despite the name and appearance, this plant is not actually a tree, but is actually an extremely large and leafy variety of cactus. Rather than solid wood like a real tree, the trunk is actually formed from thousands of thin needles that weave together into a sturdy structure and allow it to disperse heat in the harsh desert sun. Clothes, hats, and roof thatching made from these hardy plants are extremely common and useful when in the desert (even though they are admittedly a little scratchy).

## Effect:

You may spend 10 minutes weaving the fibres of this plant into protective clothing for you to wear. While wearing it, you have advantage on any Constitution saving throws made to resist the adverse effects of hot weather.

> I would like to state emphatically for the record that it was I, not Volo, who was the first to discover this plant (nor did I misidentify it as a tree). I actually came across this tree several months before he did, but alas, on my return trip to the herbologist society to record my discovery, I was waylaid by a lost princess that required my aid in returning to her kingdom. While I did manage to rescue the desperate royal, I found to my dismay that Volo had beaten me back home and taken all of my creditâ€”something that I keep as one of the few regrets of my career (for more information on the story of the lost princess, pick up a copy of 'Hamund's Harrowing Histories, vol XIV').
