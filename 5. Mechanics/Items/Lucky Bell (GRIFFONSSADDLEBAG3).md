# Lucky Bell
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Lucky-Bell.webp#right)  


This miniscule brass bell is in the shape of an upturned four-leaf clover whose clapper is actually a delicate flower. When rung normally, the flower silently patters side-to-side of the bell. However, when you use an action to speak the bell's command word and ring it, it emits a sound like an invigorating jig that's audible out to a range of 60 feet. Up to four friendly creatures of your choice that can hear the bell gain a mote of luck. Once within the next 10 minutes, when a creature with a mote of luck rolls a 1 on the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The mote is then lost. This property of the bell can't be used again until the next dawn.
