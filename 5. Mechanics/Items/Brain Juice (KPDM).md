# Brain Juice
*Potion, very rare*  


This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures such as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Aboleth.md\|aboleths]]. Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the drinker is infused with magical power and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended spell slots. On a failed save, the drinker is afflicted with a form of [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Short Term Madness.md\|short-term madness]] lasting for 1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws, it gains a form of [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Long Term Madness.md\|long-term madness]] permanently and automatically fails all further saving throws brought about by drinking brain juice.
