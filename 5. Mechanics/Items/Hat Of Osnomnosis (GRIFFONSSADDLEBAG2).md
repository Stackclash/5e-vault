# Hat of Osnomnosis
*Wondrous item, minor, common (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Hat-of-Osnomnosis.webp#right)  


This colorful, frumpy hat contains the animated and sentient spirit of a wizard's old pet. While unworn and immobile, it is indistinguishable from a normal hat. When the hat is worn and spoken to or otherwise interacted with, it springs to life and pulls its seams apart to form a stitch-ridden mouth and toothless smile.

You can use the hat as an arcane focus for your wizard spells while you're wearing it. In addition, you can feed one piece of paper to the hat using an action, destroying the paper. The hat happily accepts any paper it's fed and wiggles about as the page is chewed and swallowed. If you're wearing the hat, you immediately know any information that was contained on the piece of paper as if you had read it. If the paper or its contents were magical, it's immediately spat back out by the hat. If the paper contained a spell, such as a spell scroll or page from another wizard's spellbook, you also take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage for each level of the spell that was transcribed on the paper when it's spat out.

## Sentience

The hat of osnomnosis is a sentient chaotic good item with an Intelligence of 4, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 6. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. It can't speak or read, but can communicate with you telepathically while you're wearing it. When the hat communicates with you in this way, it can only transmit simple emotions and images. While you are attuned to it, the hat understands every language you know.

## Personality

The hat loves nothing more than being worn and eating bits of paper and is easily befriended by creatures who pet it. The hat's button eyes can't move, but it uses its cloth folds to change its expression at will.
