# Spellforge Scabbard
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Spellforge-Scabbard.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This teal leather scabbard is decorated with mithral emblems. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to drag a weapon across the scabbard. For the next minute, the weapon glows with a faint blue aura, and you can use a bonus action to magically return that weapon to the scabbard, stowing it there. If the weapon was nonmagical, it also becomes magic and has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the duration. The effect ends early if you use this property again.

The scabbard can magically hold any one weapon at a time, shunting the weapon into an extradimensional space while leaving its handle or similar end exposed and within your reach. Regardless of the weapon it's holding, the scabbard always weighs 2 pounds. Any sheathed weapon falls to the ground at your feet if your attunement to the scabbard ends or if you sheath a second weapon in it.

The scabbard has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you use the scabbard to grant a weapon a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges to increase that weapon's bonus to +2 for the duration instead.

Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of the scabbard's charges to draw any type of melee weapon out of the scabbard. The drawn weapon is spectral, remains for 1 minute, and has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. Any attack that hits with it deals force damage, instead of its normal damage type. You can use a bonus action to return the spectral weapon to the scabbard, and if the weapon would normally have the heavy property, it doesn't.
