# Phoenix Fan
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Phoenix-Fan.webp#right)  


This vibrant paper fan bears a gilded phoenix design and fire opals along its wooden clasp. The fan has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the fan, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15, spell attack bonus +7): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fire Shield.md\|fire shield]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]] (1 charge; the cloud is made of smoke), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scorching Ray.md\|scorching ray]] (2 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Fire.md\|wall of fire]] (4 charges). Alternatively, you can use a reaction when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls to expend 1 of the fan's charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] spell on up to five falling creatures within range.

You can cast these spells from the fan even if it doesn't have enough charges. When you do, there is a cumulative 20 percent chance that the fan is destroyed for each spent charge beyond the number of remaining charges in the fan. If the fan is destroyed in this way, the spell fails and the action to cast it is wasted, and the fan is consumed by flame as it turns to ash and is destroyed.
