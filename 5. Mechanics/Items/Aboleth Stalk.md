# Aboleth Stalk
*Herb, rare, Herb*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHbH/AbolethStalk.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

It is theorised that this plant spawns from the tidewashed droppings of an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Aboleth.md\|aboleth]], lodging itself in dark, damp corners of the coast and growing into an unpleasant herb that resembles the stalks of its creator in a vague Y-shape. The mucus that the plant secretes has a mind-altering effect, causing those that imbibe it to open themselves to telepathic communication with anyone else that has consumed it.

## Effect:

This herb may be prepared by two creatures at the same time by sucking the mucus on the two top prongs of the herb for the length of the preparation. Once prepared, any creature that prepared the herb may communicate telepathically with any other creature that prepared the herb, up to a range of 500 feet. This effect lasts for 6 hours. Once used, this herb goes dry and becomes useless.
