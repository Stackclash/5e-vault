# Bag of Sundrops
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bag-of-Sundrops.webp#right)  


This small, colorful bag is filled with `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) golden, marble-like orbs called sundrops that glow softly when held. As an action, you can throw a sundrop at a point or object you can see within 30 feet. When you do, the orb explodes into a dazzling pillar of light that lasts until the start of your next turn. The pillar is a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light centered on the point where the sundrop shattered. The light is sunlight.

A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] spell targeting the light ends the effect early.
