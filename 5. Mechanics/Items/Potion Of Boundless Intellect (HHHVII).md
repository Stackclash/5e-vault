- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, your Intelligence score increases to 21 if it was lower than that before, and you gain proficiency in the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#History\|History]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Nature\|Nature]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Religion\|Religion]], and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]] skills if you were not proficient in them before. This effect lasts for 24 hours, after which you suffer 2 levels of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] as your brain attempts to process the mental surge it just experienced. This potion is a dull grey color with chunks of partly solidified matter floating in it.
