# Frozen Fuel
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

An innocuous looking plant growing in frozen fields that is often overlooked by anyone unaccustomed to arctic survival. This small, bulby, white plant contains a special resin that it uses to insulate its interior against harsh arctic winds and survive till summer. This resin is in fact highly flammable, and also exceedingly sticky which makes it excellent as a makeshift tar. Arctic people have used it for everything from campfire fuel, to [[5. Mechanics/Items/Torch.md\|torch]] heads, to makeshift bombs with a simple application of a spark.

## Effect:

You may throw this herb as a ranged weapon attack at a point within 20 feet of you that you can see causing the bulb of this herb to burst and forcing all creatures within 5 feet of it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature is covered in a sticky, flammable resin which makes them vulnerable to fire damage. A creature covered in this resin or a creature adjacent to them may use their action to wipe this resin off, ending this effect immediately.
