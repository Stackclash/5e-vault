# Hammer of the Ram
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Maul.md\|maul]]), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Hammer-of-the-Ram.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This all-silver hammer carries a mighty force behind it with every swing. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If the hammer hits an object that isn't being worn or carried, the hit is a critical hit.

The hammer has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a target with the hammer, you can expend 1 to 3 of its charges to force the target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. For each charge expended, the target takes an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you on a failed save. On a successful save, the target takes half as much force damage and isn't pushed.

## Ring of the Ram

If you're also attuned to the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of The Ram.md\|ring of the ram]], your bonus to attack and damage rolls with the hammer increases to +2, and the hammer's every swing creates a projection of the spectral ram from the ring. The ram lurches forward from the head of the hammer, effectively increasing your reach with the weapon by an additional 5 feet. In addition, the hammer and ring share a pool of charges: any charge you have with the ring can be used for the hammer's properties, and vice versa.
