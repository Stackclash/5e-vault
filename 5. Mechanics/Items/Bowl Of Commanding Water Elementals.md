# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Water Elemental.md|water elemental]], as if you had cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Elemental.md|conjure elemental]] spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
