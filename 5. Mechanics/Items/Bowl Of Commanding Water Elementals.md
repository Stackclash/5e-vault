# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/bowl-of-commanding-water-elementals.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 24.0 lbs.

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Water Element(AL).md\|water elemental]], as if you had cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]] spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
