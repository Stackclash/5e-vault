# Covolt Star
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Morningstar.md\|morningstar]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Covolt-Star.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

The head and spikes of this morningstar are made of covolt. Arcs of electricity snap between its spikes while you hold it. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage.

As an action, you can hold the morningstar aloft and speak its command word, causing powerful tendrils of lightning to explode from its spikes. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you that you can see must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
