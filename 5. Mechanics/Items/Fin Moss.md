# Fin Moss
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Often mistaken for a school of fish resting on a seabed rock, fin moss is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: moss that is shaped like a fin. This shape grants it two somewhat useful physical properties—the first is that it adheres to things very well, the other is that it is extremely hydrodynamic. Due to these properties, they can actually be used as a natural weapon attachment, allowing them to function properly underwater (at the cost of looking a little bit silly).

## Effect:

You may spend 10 minutes attaching these herbs to 1 melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Any weapon or ammunition that has this moss attached to it suffers no penalty when used underwater. These herbs may only be attached to one weapon or set of ammunition—any attempt to remove them damages them beyond use.
