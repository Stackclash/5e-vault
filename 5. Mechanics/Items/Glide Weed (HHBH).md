# Glide Weed
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

What is often mistaken for a mass of solid ground floating on the water is actually a mass of tiny, pyramid-shaped, weeds that glide across the ocean's surface like a moving island. These weeds are covered in a hydrodynamic oil that keeps the plants buoyant, allowing them to spread their seeds far and wide. Coastal societies have developed a system of extracting this oil and applying it to their own bodies, allowing them to swim through the waters with all the ease of any fish in the sea

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you have a swim speed equal to your movement speed if it was lower than that before.
