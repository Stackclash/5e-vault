# Amulet of the Lycanthrope

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This rounded amulet depicts a harrowing crescent moon with blood-red claw marks running through its center. The markings emit a dim red light on the day of a full moon.

If you're not a lycanthrope, you can use a bonus action while wearing the amulet to assume a more bestial appearance, taking on the claws and defining features of either a bear, rat, tiger, or wolf (your choice). This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 hit points or use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. For the duration, you can use your claws as natural weapons when making unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on hearing or smell for the duration of the transformation. This property can't be used again for 12 hours or until the next dusk, whichever comes first. Alternatively, if it's within 24 hours of a full moon, this property can be used again after 6 hours, instead of 12.

If you're already a lycanthrope and are wearing the amulet, your claw and bite attacks while in your animal or hybrid forms deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, your bite attack save DC increases by 3.

## Curse

This amulet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist becoming cursed by lycanthropy.
