- **Damage**: 1d8 piercing
- **Range**: 150/600
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This bow was crafted by a powerful [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Djinni.md\|djinni]] in the Stormheart: a perpetual maelstrom of wind and electricity in the Elemental Plane of Air. Lost to time, it has remained in the storm for untold centuries absorbing the volatile magic that runs rampant there. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

## A Storm is Coming

While the bow is on your person, you add a `dice:d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) to your initiative at the start of every combat.

## Fast as Lightning

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, you can make one attack with the bow as a bonus action.

## Discharge

A target and any creature within 5 feet of it takes `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) lightning damage the first time that target is hit by a ranged attack with the bow on your turn. A creature can only take lighting damage from this property once each round.

## Chained Conduits

When you hit a target with a ranged attack with the bow, that target becomes a conduit for electricity for 1 minute. You can speak the bow's command word as a bonus action to cause all conduits within 60 feet of you to electrify. When you do, 5-foot-wide lines of electricity arc between all electrified conduits that are within 30 feet of each other. Each conduit takes `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) lightning damage, and all other creatures within the lines of electricity must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once a conduit has been electrified in this way, it is no longer a conduit. A creature or object can only take lightning damage from this property once each round.

## Maelstrom Marksman

Once on each of your turns when you miss a target with a ranged attack with the bow, you can reroll the attack against a different target you can see within 30 feet of the first one. You have disadvantage on this attack.

## Zephyr Step

While holding the bow, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover up to 20 feet off the ground.

## Embrace the Storm

While you're attuned to the bow, you're subjected to the chaotic magic of the Stormheart whenever you take lightning damage. When you do, roll a `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) and use the table below to determine the resulting effect.

**Stormheart Effects**

`dice: [[Ionbreaker The Tempests Reach (TGS1).md#^stormheart-effects]]`

| dice: d8 | result |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | You are vulnerable to lightning damage until the end of your next turn. |
| 2 | You are thrown 20 feet in a random direction and knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. |
| 3 | You are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] for 1 hour. |
| 4 | You can't take reactions for 1 minute. |
| 5 | You cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]], centered on a point within 5 feet of you, without requiring concentration that remains for `dice:1d4\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`d4`) rounds. |
| 6 | Up to three random creatures within 10 feet of you take `dice:1d8\|noform\|noparens\|avg` (`d8`) lightning damage. |
| 7 | Your speed is doubled until the end of your next turn. |
| 8 | You are immune to lightning damage until the end of your next turn. |

Ionbreaker, the Tempest's Reach has the following random properties:

- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Beneficial Properties.md\|minor beneficial property]]  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial property]]

- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Detrimental Properties.md\|major detrimental property]]  

## Destroying the Bow

The bow can be destroyed if it's struck by lightning in the Stormheart at the same time as it's hit by a hammer of pure adamantine against a similarly adamantine anvil by a creature attuned to the bow. Once destroyed, all creatures within 60 feet of the bow take `dice:10d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d10`) lightning damage and `dice:10d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d10`) force damage. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this damage, it's immediately turned to ash and can only be revived by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell.
