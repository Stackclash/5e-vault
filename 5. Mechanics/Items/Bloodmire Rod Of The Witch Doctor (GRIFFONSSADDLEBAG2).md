# Bloodmire Rod of the Witch Doctor
*Rod, major, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, paladin, or warlock)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bloodmire-Rod-of-the-Witch-Doctor.webp#right)  


This gnarled wooden scepter from the Bloodmire is set with a strange, cracked opal at its head and can be used as a spellcasting focus. The rod has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) expended charges daily at dusk.

While holding the rod, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to create a magical tether of light between the rod and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The tether's color and effects depend on what kind of tether you create. You can only have one of each tether at a time.

## Empowering Tether

This tether is a brilliant white. A creature affected by this tether regains `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) hit points when it's first affected by it, and while it's connected to the tether, it deals an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) damage of the weapon's type to the first target it hits with a melee weapon attack on each of its turns. In addition, on each of your following turns while you maintain the tether, you can expend 1 of the rod's charges as a bonus action to send a surge of healing magic through the tether and cause the target to regain `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) hit points.

## Withering Tether

This tether is a sickly red. A creature affected by this tether must make a Constitution saving throw when it's first affected by it, using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) necrotic damage, and on each of your following turns while you maintain the tether, you can use a bonus action to deal `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) necrotic damage to the target automatically. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much necrotic damage, and the tether immediately ends.

The tether ends after 1 minute. It ends early if you sever the tether (no action required), are no longer holding the rod, the target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, the target has total cover from you, or if you or the target fall [[/5.
