- **Weight**: 0.075 lbs.

These metallic bolts are magnetically charged by magic. When found, there are `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) bolts in a set. When you make a ranged attack with one of the bolts and hit a target that's made of metal or is wearing metal armor, you can choose to either pull or push the target up to 5 feet towards or away from you. Alternatively, you can use this property of the bolts even if the target isn't made of metal or wearing metal armor if you hit it with another lodestone bolt within the last 1 minute. A target that is Huge or larger can't be moved by this property.
