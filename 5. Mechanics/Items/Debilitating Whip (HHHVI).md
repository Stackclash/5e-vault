This whip has 6 wicked tails made from a roper tendril that still had its hair-like growths intact. The wielder of this whip may choose to make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check using the whip instead of their free hand.

A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by this whip is considered [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] on top of being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] and has disadvantage on all Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
