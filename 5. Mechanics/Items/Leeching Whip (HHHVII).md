# Leeching Whip
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Whip.md\|whip]]), rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

When you hit a Huge or smaller sized creature with this weapon, you may make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check against them as a free action, using this whip to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] instead of your free hand. While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] in this way, you may not attack with this weapon. If you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by this weapon, you may spend an action to force that creature to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) necrotic damage. In addition, if a creature fails their saving throw, a vial's worth of their blood becomes stored in the whip, which you may harvest as an action without requiring a check. This whip can only store one vial's worth of blood at a time.
