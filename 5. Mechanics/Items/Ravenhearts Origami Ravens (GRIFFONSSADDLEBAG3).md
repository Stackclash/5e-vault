# Ravenheart's Origami Ravens
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Ravenhearts-Origami-Ravens.webp#right)  


This slim wooden carrying case holds three dark paper birds. While holding a paper bird, you can use an action to speak its command phrase, "By fold and feather, fly." When you do, the paper springs to life and transforms into a raven for 1 hour. For the duration, the raven is treated as if it were your familiar summoned by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell. Its animal form can't be changed. The raven reverts to its paper form at the end of the hour, if it's reduced to 0 hit points, or if you dismiss it. When it does, it immediately tears itself to tiny paper shreds and is destroyed.
