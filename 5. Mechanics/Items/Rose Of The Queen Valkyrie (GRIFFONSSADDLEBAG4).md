A sharp and coiled rose blossom rests at the top of this gilded spear. A pair of silver, winglike leaves stretch outward from either side of it. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse property. When a creature is slain with this weapon, a red rose grows from the corpse after 7 days.

## Blooming Strike

Whenever you hit a target with the spear, it takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage from the attack. Once on each of your turns when you deal this extra damage, you can cause up to two other creatures that you can see within 5 feet of the target to also take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage, as a spray of thorns fly outward from the spear.

## Flurry of Thorns

You can use an action to spin the spear above you, sending a cascade of magical thorns out from you in a 20-foot radius. Each other creature within that area must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) piercing damage. Any creature within 5 feet of you has disadvantage on the saving throw and takes an additional `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) slashing damage from the effect on a failed save.

## Returning

When you make a ranged attack with this spear, it returns to your open hand immediately after the attack.
