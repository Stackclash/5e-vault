# Plaguebane Mask
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Plaguebane-Mask.webp#right)  


This bird-like mask's blend of magic and science is as unique as it is helpful. It can be easily lifted over your face to eat or speak more clearly. The mask's beak is lined with magical flowers that react to and purify airborne toxins before they pass through it. While wearing the mask, you have advantage against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] or diseased from airborne sources, as well as resistance to the poison damage that they might cause.

In addition, the flowers have 3 charges and regain `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges each day at dawn as new flowers bloom. As an action, you can hold the beak's nostrils closed with a free hand and expend 1 of its charges to exhale a 15-foot cone of thick pollen in front of you. Creatures caught in the pollen must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed is halved until the end of its next turn and takes `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage. On a success, its speed is unaffected and the poison damage is halved.
