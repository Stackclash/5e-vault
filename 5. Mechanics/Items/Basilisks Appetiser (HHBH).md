# Basilisk's Appetiser
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A knobbly root found in the depths of caves, said to grow where basilisks leave their droppings. The internal ecosystem of the root itself leads to the cultivation of colonies of bacteria that when inadvertently consumed with the root, radically alters one's digestive system to be able to process hard minerals and rocks as if it were any other food. While the thought of this may be off putting, there are numerous tales of cave-in survivors that owe their lives to this wondrous plant.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) charges. When you use this herb, you expend one charge. For the next 24 hours, you are able to eat and digest rocks, with 1 pound of rocks providing the equivalent of a full day's worth of nutrition. Unfortunately, it does nothing to improve the flavour or texture.

I must say though, while eating the rocks was undoubtedly unpleasant, the worst part is when the time comes to pass it out the other end...
