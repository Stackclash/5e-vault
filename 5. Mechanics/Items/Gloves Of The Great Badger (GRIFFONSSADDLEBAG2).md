# Gloves of the Great Badger
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Gloves-of-the-Great-Badger.webp#right)  


This pair of fingerless gloves is decorated with badgerlike stripes and fitted with razor-sharp claws. While wearing the gloves, your unarmed strikes with them deal slashing damage equal to `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, you gain a burrowing speed of 5 feet.

While wearing the gloves, you can use a bonus action to invoke the might of a giant badger, granting the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your burrowing speed is doubled, and you can burrow through nonmagical, unworked stone.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls whenever you make an unarmed strike with the gloves.  
- Your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.  

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
