This whip has 6 wicked tails made from a roper tendril that still had its hair-like growths intact. The wielder of this whip may choose to make a grapple check using the whip instead of their free hand.

A creature grappled by this whip is considered restrained on top of being grappled and has disadvantage on all Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
