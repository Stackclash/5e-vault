# Luna Moth Cape
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Luna-Moth-Cape.webp#right)  


This beautiful elven cape is fashioned after the wings of a luna moth. While wearing the cape, you can move an extra 10 feet when you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action.

In addition, while wearing this cape, you can speak its command word as a bonus action when you jump to cause it to unfurl and flap downwards, sending you 10 feet into the air when you reach the height of your jump. This property can't be used again until you land on solid ground.
