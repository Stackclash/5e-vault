While wearing this armor, you have a +1 bonus to AC and you constantly exude an aura of magical darkness that only you can see in around yourself in a 10-foot radius. Within this aura, non-magical light can be no brighter than dim light. You may turn this aura on or off by speaking the item's command word as a bonus action.
