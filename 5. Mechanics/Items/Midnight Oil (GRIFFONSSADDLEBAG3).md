# Midnight Oil
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Midnight-Oil.webp#right)  


This iridescent pitcher carries 8 ounces of magic oil, which looks like a starry night sky. You can use an action to pour out 1 or more ounces of the oil on the ground at your feet. Choose a point on the ground within 5 feet of you. The oil creates a sphere of darkness centered on that point. This darkness duplicates the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Darkness.md\|darkness]] spell (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] required). The effect remains for a number of rounds equal to the number of ounces poured from the pitcher, ending at the end of your turn on the round that it would end. It ends early if any target within the darkness takes fire damage. In addition, the magical darkness is serenely focusing: creatures within the darkness have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]].
