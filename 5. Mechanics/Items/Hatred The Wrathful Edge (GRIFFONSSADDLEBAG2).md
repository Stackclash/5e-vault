- **Damage**: 1d12 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]

This black iron axe was forged in the scorching fires of the Magmarath Caldera and has been the decisive end for countless mortal souls. Used as the mark of a Tribunal in the caldera's city, the weapon is an embodiment of anger and spite, and has been enchanted with blood magic that bubbles to the surface each time it's used to end a life. Glimmering veins of lava flicker from its dark metal surface, and roiling, volcanic sparks trail behind it in its wake when swung.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) fire or lightning damage (your choice) to any target it hits. When you reduce a living creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the fire or lightning damage dealt as part of the attack.

## Explosive Rage

If you're a barbarian, the first time you enter a rage after finishing a short or long rest, up to 6 creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) fire or lightning damage (your choice). In addition, while raging, any creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire or lightning damage (your choice).

## Fiendish Mind

You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal while attuned to this weapon.

- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial property]]  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental property]]  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Detrimental Properties.md\|major detrimental property]]  

## Volcanic Immunity

You are immune to fire damage while attuned to this weapon. In addition, you can stand on and walk across molten rock as if it were solid ground.

## Sentience

Hatred, the Wrathful Edge is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common and Infernal.

## Personality

The weapon enjoys the sensation of anger. It sees all conflict eventually reaching the same violent conclusion, and encourages its wielder to seek out such hasty and bloody resolutions.

## Destroying the Axe

The only way to destroy the axe is to dispel the malevolent spirit within it over time from the Upper Planes. Casting [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Evil And Good.md\|dispel evil and good]] on the weapon every day for 5 years while on an Upper Plane causes the wrathful spirit within it to eventually succumb and perish. When the spirit leaves the axe, it loses all of its properties except for its bonus to attack and damage rolls, but becomes no harder to destroy than a normal magic weapon.
