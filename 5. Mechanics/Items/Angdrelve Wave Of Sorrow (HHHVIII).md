  - Two-handed: 3d6 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]

The greatsword Angdrelve is also known as the Wave of Sorrow and is one of the deadliest weapons in the multiverse. Like its dark master, Angdrelve is beautiful but cruel, its many dark curves drawing the eye away in a maddening dance as it twirls and spins through the battlefield. In fact, a popular legend states that the sword was once a regular sword with a straight edge, but as Graz'zt fought and slaughtered his way through the Abyss to claim his title as Demon Lord, the sword became as twisted and crooked as his soul.

When you attune to this weapon, your appearance changes to become supernaturally beautiful, if slightly offputting to mortals that gaze upon you. You have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with creatures that are not immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] condition. You lose this benefit if you ever end your attunement to this weapon, but your appearance remains the same. If you are no longer attuned to Angdrelve, a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, or similar magic cast on you will revert you to your original appearance.

## Magic Weapon

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, whenever you successfully hit with this weapon, you may choose to deal an additional `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) acid damage to your target.

## Random Properties

Angdrelve has the following randomly determined properties:

- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial]] properties  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  

## Teleport

While holding this weapon, you may use your action to magically teleport along with anything you are wearing or carrying to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you.

## Spellcasting

While holding this weapon, you may use your action to use it to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Crown Of Madness.md\|crown of madness]] spell, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Command.md\|command]] spell, or the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dissonant Whispers.md\|dissonant whispers]] spell as a 3rd level spell. The spell save DC for these spells cast in this way is considered 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency modifier.

## Curse

As the weapon of a Demon Lord, Angdrelve bares a lingering curse for any mortal that attunes to it. While afflicted by this curse, whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you become obsessed with inflicting pain on that creature and must spend your action on any subsequent turn to inflict damage on them in some way, including using any movement available for you to reach them. If you are unable to inflict damage on them due to being unable to target them with the actions available to you, this effect ends. You may make the saving throw again at the end of each of your subsequent turns, also ending the effect on a success. This effect also ends if the target of your obsession dies. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to Angdrelve and end the obsession immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current obsession. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed.

## Destroying Angdrelve

The only way to destroy Angdrelve is for it to be placed within a pitch-black box and be untouched and unseen by any creature for 200 years, after which it dissolves into a foul ichor.
