This pair of scimitars was forged in the Elemental Plane of Air and cut effortlessly through the air in tandem. Attuning to one of the scimitars automatically attunes you to both of them, which count as one attuned item.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which have the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with one of the scimitars, it flies back to your hand. In addition, when you engage in two-weapon fighting using both scimitars, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

As an action, you can speak the scimitars' command words and throw the two swords at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The two weapons spin wildly and create a sudden whirlwind in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on the point. A target caught in the whirlwind's area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the point in a random direction and knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. The scimitars fly back to your hands immediately after the effect. Once this property of the scimitars has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
