# Kraken Shield
*Shield, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: Crafted by
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While wearing this shield, you gain a +3 bonus to your AC. While wearing this shield, you are immune to lightning damage, and if you are subjected to an effect that would cause you to suffer lightning damage, you may spend your reaction to choose another target you can see within 30 feet of you (including the source of the effect). You redirect the effect towards that target. That target acts as if it was the initial target of the effect and suffers any results as appropriate.
