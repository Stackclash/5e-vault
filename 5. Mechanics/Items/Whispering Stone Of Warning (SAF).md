# Whispering Stone of Warning
*Wondrous item, requires installation, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/whispering-stone-warning.jpg#right)  


You may stare intently at the closed eye carved into this stone and repeatedly whisper a creature type or alignment to the stone for 10 minutes. The stone's eye opens and displays that name in runic text upon its pupil. If any creature of that type or alignment enters your demesne, the stone whispers to you, warning you of its presence. You can hear this whisper across any distance, but only if you are on the plane as the stone. After a season, the rune begins to fade. You can replace the creature type or alignment the stone warns against by performing the ritual again.
