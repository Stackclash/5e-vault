# Ring of Invisibility
*Ring, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/ring-of-invisibility.webp#right]]  


While wearing this ring, you can turn [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] with you. You remain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.
