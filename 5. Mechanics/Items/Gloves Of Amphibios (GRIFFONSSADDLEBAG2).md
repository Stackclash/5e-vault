These gloves come in many different colors and meld seamlessly into your hands when you don them. While wearing these gloves, climbing doesn't cost you extra movement, you gain a +1 bonus to Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) checks made to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] a creature, and any creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by you that is not wearing armor takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) poison damage at the end of each of your turns.
