# Set of Secret Scribe Candles
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Set-of-Secret-Scribe-Candles.webp#right)  


This pair of candles are magically linked and never seems to run out of wick.

You can light one of the candles to cause it to burn with a blue flame. By holding parchment over the flame, any ink on the page is burnt off, leaving the paper unmarked. When you finish using the candle in this way, you can extinguish the flame as you normally would. Once you do, the linked candle suddenly comes alight with a normal, orange fire, that cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. The newly lit candle gives off a faint lavender scent. By holding a plain piece of parchment over the orange flame, the ink from the first piece of parchment is magically burnt onto the new one as the candle heats it. Once all the ink has been transcribed onto new parchment in this way, the orange flame winks out.
