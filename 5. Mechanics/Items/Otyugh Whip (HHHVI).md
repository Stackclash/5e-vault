You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit a Medium or smaller sized creature with this weapon, you may make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check against them as a free action, using the whip to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] instead of your free hand. This ability can only be used once per turn. While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] in this way, you may not attack with this whip.
