This roughly hewn obsidian dagger is razor sharp and can be used as a spellcasting focus. Its handle is covered in small holes that drink in whatever blood runs down the blade. There's a small reservoir for blood at the dagger's pommel that seems to never completely fill. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The dagger has 5 charges and regains `dice:1d3+2|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the dagger, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to make a melee spell attack using your spell attack bonus against a living creature you can see within 5 feet of you. When you do, an illusory crimson dagger sweeps out towards the creature. A creature hit by this attack takes necrotic damage equal to `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) + your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. If the target is a construct, plant, or undead creature, you don't regain any hit points in this way.

Alternatively, while holding the dagger, you can expend 1 or more of its charges when you cast a spell using a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell slot. The spell must target either a single creature or yourself. The spell slot you use to cast this spell counts as one level higher for each charge you expend in this way. You can't increase a spell slot level beyond 5th level in this way. When you use this property of the dagger, you also expend 1 Hit Die for each charge you expend in this way. Roll a number of Hit Dice equal to the number of expended charges and take necrotic damage equal to the total you roll. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. If expending charges in this way causes you to fall to 0 hit points, the spell fails and you fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]].
