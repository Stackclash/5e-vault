This crystalline battleaxe seems to be almost transparent when looking at the bladed head from different angles. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. The first time on your turn when you hit a target with a ranged attack using the axe, you can force another creature within 10 feet of the target to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, that creature takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) force damage.

If you can see the axe and are within 60 feet of it, you can use a bonus action to return the axe back to your outstretched hand. When you do, the weapon phases through any obstacle in its path that is no more than 5 feet thick or made of lead.
