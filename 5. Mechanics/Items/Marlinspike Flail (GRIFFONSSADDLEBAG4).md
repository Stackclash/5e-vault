# Marlinspike Flail
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Flail.md\|flail]]), uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Marlinspike-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The head of this flail is a heavy iron ball, and is held onto a bosun's marlinspike with a series of clever, sturdy knots. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you're proficient with water vehicles, you have advantage on any ability check you make to untie a knot using the marlinspike, and whenever you hit an object or structure with it, you can roll the weapon's damage die twice, instead of once; you choose which result to use for the weapon's damage.
