# Hood of the Aquatic Ambush
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this hood, you can breathe underwater, you have a swimming speed of 60 feet, and if you make a weapon attack against a surprised creature while both of you are submerged in liquid, your attack is considered a critical hit so long as it hits successfully.
