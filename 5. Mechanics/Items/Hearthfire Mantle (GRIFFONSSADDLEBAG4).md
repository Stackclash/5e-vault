# Hearthfire Mantle
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Hearthfire-Mantle.webp#right)  


The inside of this heavy leather cloak is decorated with the image of a roaring fireplace. Brick-like patches of leather line the rim of the cloak, which always feel fire-warmed to the touch. While wearing the cloak, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. Laying the cloak on the ground or hanging it on a wall with its fiery inside exposed creates as much warmth as a small campfire.

You can use an action while wearing the cloak to speak one of its two command words and activate its properties.

## "Kindle."

You ignite a flammable object you're holding.

## "Warm."

Nonhostile creatures within 10 feet of you gain `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) temporary hit points. A creature with these hit points can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
