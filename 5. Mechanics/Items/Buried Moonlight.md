# Buried Moonlight
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

This herb is not a specific variety of plant, but rather it refers to a phenomenon that occurs in the roots of trees when they burrow into the right areas of the ground. While it is common for roots to hang from the ceilings of some caves, it is a much rarer occurrence for them to become suffused with the magic of the earth, causing them to emit a pale, but rather pleasant lightâ€”something that will happen to you too if you rub this herb on yourself, as well as anyone you manage to touch. Those who have eaten the herb have described its effects as calming, as well as a source of amusement by using their light trails to draw rather...rude shapes and messages.

## Effect:

For the next 8 hours after using this herb, you glow with a pale light reminiscent of moonlight, even when [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible\|invisible]]. While glowing in this way, you shed bright light in a 5-foot radius around you, and dim light for a further 10 feet beyond that. In addition, any creature that you touch or succeed in a melee weapon attack against also glows with this same light until the end of your next turn.

> Personally, I disagree with the hypothesis that it is magic that causes the transformation. I instead propose that it is caused by a breed of algae too small to be seen with the naked eye that bonds with the root for safe anchorage in exchange for providing nutrients. Unfortunately I am unable to test my theory, as the sample I intended on testing ended up being lost when I had to use it to fight off a rather naughty behir I had met down in that cave system (for more information on this fight, pick up a copy of 'Hamund's Humble Hypotheses, Volume VII').
