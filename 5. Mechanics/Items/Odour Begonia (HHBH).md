# Odour Begonia
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A particularly bright red begonia that rises somewhat beautifully out of fetid swamp mud. However, its beauty belies its insidious nature, as a side effect of combatting its toxic environment causes it to build up a chemical with an incredibly sharp, acetone smell. This chemical is so powerful in fact, that it will temporarily shut off the olfactory senses of anyone who crushes this herb and receives a whiff of the miasma inside. This side effect has been used by some people with unpleasant jobs to avoid the nastier environments they work in, such as sewers, plague hospitals, and tanning houses.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you have no sense of smell.
