# Black Elixir
*Potion, legendary*  


This greasy black liquid acts as a poison when drunk or rubbed on flesh. Its unfortunate or foolish user takes `dice:12d6|noform|avg` (`12d6`) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 20 Constitution saving throw.

Its true power is revealed, however, when black elixir is smeared on a doorway or other portal; the magical oil acts as a forbiddance spell with a duration of one year. Unlike the spell, black elixir doesn't incorporate a password and only affects celestials and fiends. Typically, the creator of the elixir determines when the elixir is created whether the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Forbiddance.md\|forbiddance]] effect deals radiant or necrotic damage.

## Ingredients

The heart of a marut, the powdered horn of a ki-rin, and a vial of black mud taken from the bottom of a lake that at least one celestial or fiend has bathed in.
