# Candleflame Claymore
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greatsword.md\|greatsword]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Candleflame-Claymore.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This weighty blade has an iron candelabra as its hilt. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a target and roll two of the same number on the weapon's slashing damage dice, the target takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage. If you've taken fire damage from a hostile source since the end of your last turn, the first target you hit with this weapon on your turn automatically takes this extra fire damage.

You can use an action to place up to two candles in the candelabra hilt, adding one to each of its twin candle holders. Candles placed and lit in the hilt can burn for up to 8 hours, instead of 1, and shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
