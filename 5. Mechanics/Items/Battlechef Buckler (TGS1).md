This small shield is the repurposed pot lid of a famous adventuring chef. While wielding the shield, you have advantage on saving throws to resist or avoid taking fire damage. In addition, if you place the shield face down over a pot or similar vessel that's holding no more than 2 gallons of a water-based liquid inside, the vessel and its liquid comes to a rolling boil after 10 minutes.
