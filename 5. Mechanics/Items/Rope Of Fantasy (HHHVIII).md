# Rope of Fantasy
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This coil of rope is 30 feet long. Any creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by this rope for 1 minute must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]]. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, a creature becomes extremely calm and unaggressive as they receive visions of their deepest wishes. The creature remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] until the rope is removed or until they receive damage. Once a creature has become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by this rope once, or if they passed the initial saving throw, they cannot be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] again by this rope for 24 hours.
