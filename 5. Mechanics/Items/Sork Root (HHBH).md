# Sork Root
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

A notably soft and soggy root that is found by looking for the slimy shoots it grows above the ground. Adapted to areas with extremely high levels of moisture, it produces enzymes that causes it to process water very quickly. A creature that chews on this root gains those enzymes, causing them to exude a similar, slippery mucus from their pores. Small animals have taken to chewing this root in order to escape predators.

## Effect:

As an action, you may place this root in your mouth and begin chewing on it. While chewing on this root, you exude a slippery mucus that makes you difficult to grab. Any Strength check made to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] you is made at disadvantage, and you do not suffer any penalties when squeezing into tight spaces. This root may be chewed for up to 5 minutes, which you may do all at once, or over several sessions.
