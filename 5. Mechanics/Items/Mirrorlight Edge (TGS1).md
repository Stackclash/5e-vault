# Mirrorlight Edge
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Scimitar.md\|scimitar]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Mirrorlight-Edge.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This roughly hewn crystal sword bends light in unexpected and dangerous ways. As an action, you can speak the scimitar's command word to cause it to emit up to 2 ghostly projections of itself. The sword can have up to 2 of these projections at any time, which last until you dismiss them (no action required). When swung, the ghostly projections make the sword difficult to see. When you make an attack with the sword and miss while it has at least 1 projection, you can dismiss one of its projections to reroll the attack. You must use the new roll.

When you hit a target with this weapon while it has at least 1 projection, the ghostly projections become razor sharp. Targets hit by the sword take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) slashing damage for each projection the sword has.

The sword emits dim light in a 10-foot radius while it has 1 projection and 20 feet while it has 2. Sheathing the scimitar contains the projections and their light without dismissing them.
