# Blizzard Sphere
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Blizzard-Sphere.webp#right)  


This glass sphere contains a raging blizzard inside. It's cold to the touch and vibrates with the gusts of wind trapped within. As an action, you can throw the orb at a point or object you can see within 30 feet, shattering it on impact. When the orb shatters, the blizzard erupts from the glass in a 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling ice and snow centered on the point of impact. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) cold damage and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is unaffected.

The blizzard remains for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds or until targeted by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] spell (DC 15 or cast at 5th level or higher). Any surface within the area is covered in a slick sheet of ice and sleet, turning the ground within the sphere into difficult terrain that remains for the effect's duration. While the blizzard persists, the area is heavily obscured.
