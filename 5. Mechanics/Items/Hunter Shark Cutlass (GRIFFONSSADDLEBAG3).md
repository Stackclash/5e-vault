The blade of this sword is carved from the tooth of a giant shark. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If the target is a creature that's missing any of its hit points, it takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) slashing damage from the attack. You have advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check made to track a creature you've hit with the sword within the last hour.

In addition, while the sword is on your person, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and can breathe underwater. Further, sharks are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
