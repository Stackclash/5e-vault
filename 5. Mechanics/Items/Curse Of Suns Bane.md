# Curse of Sun's Bane
*Curse, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:

## Curse:

> [!quote]-  
> 
> While attuned to this item you become cursed. While cursed in this way, you become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] and banished to the Ethereal Plane whenever you start your turn in sunlight. This effect persists so long as sunlight continues to shine on the spot you once were. If the spot you were once in no longer is covered in sunlight, you return to that spot and you are no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]].
> 
> This curse ends permanently on both the item and you if the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic is cast on either you or the cursed item.
