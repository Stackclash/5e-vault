# Eldritch Scarf
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Eldritch-Scarf.webp#right)  


This dark scarf moves slowly on its own and is always wrinkled. The scarf hides an extradimensional space within its folds that can only be reached while you wear it. The space holds 60 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 6 cubic feet. The scarf always weighs 1 pound, regardless of its contents. When you place an object in this space (no action required), your hand vanishes into the scarf's loose folds.

You can't retrieve items placed within the scarf with your hands. Instead, you can use a bonus action to mentally control the scarf, causing its frayed, hand-like ends to reach within the space and retrieve a stored item. The hands can carry up to 10 pounds and drop any object weighing more than that on the ground at your feet.

Ironing or otherwise flattening the scarf causes the items stored inside to be squeezed out, spilling forth unharmed from the ends of the scarf. If the scarf is destroyed, its contents are lost forever. A living creature can't be placed inside the scarf.

In addition, while wearing the scarf, you can use an action to mentally control it, using the scarf's frayed hands instead of your own to manipulate a simple object, such as open an unlocked door, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial within 5 feet of you. The hands can't attack or activate magic items.

Placing the scarf inside an extradimensional space created by a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Holding.md\|bag of holding]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Portable Hole.md\|portable hole]], or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
