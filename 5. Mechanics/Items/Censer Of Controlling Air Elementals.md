# Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/censer-of-controlling-air-elementals.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak the censer's command word and summon an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Air Element(AL).md\|air elemental]], as if you had cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]] spell. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.
