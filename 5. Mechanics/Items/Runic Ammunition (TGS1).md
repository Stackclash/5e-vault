# Runic Ammunition
*Minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Runic-Ammunition.webp#right)  


Runic ammunition resembles normal bolts, arrows, or stones that are etched with runes and are magically discordant to spellcasters. When a creature concentrating on a spell or magical effect is hit by a piece of runic ammunition, that creature makes the resulting Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration with disadvantage.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.
