*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*

You're considered to be proficient with land vehicles while wearing this amulet, and you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to perform either repairs or routine maintenance on such a vehicle. In addition, traveling by way of a land vehicle at a normal pace doesn't prevent you from using stealth, nor does traveling at a fast pace in one give you a penalty to your passive Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) score. You have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Animal%20Handling\|Animal Handling]]) checks made with any mount pulling the vehicle.

Lastly, while wearing this amulet, any mount that's pulling a land vehicle you control gains a +2 bonus to any Constitution saving throw it makes to endure a forced march.
