# Amulet of the Trickster
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you kill a humanoid while wearing this amulet, you may spend your reaction to add an imprint of their identity to it. At any time afterwards, you may spend your action to polymorph yourself into any humanoid whose identity you have imprinted into this amulet. You gain the statistics of that creature, including their ability scores and any racial features, but you do not gain any of their class features. While polymorphed, you gain access to any memories that humanoid had at the time of their death, and your mannerisms and voice become indistinguishable to the real humanoid. This polymorph lasts for 1 hour, until your drop to 0 hit points or die, or if you end the effect early as an action. If the effect ends as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

This polymorph ability may only be used once per dawn to polymorph into each identity you have imprinted. This item loses any imprinted identities it had if attunement to it is ever broken.
