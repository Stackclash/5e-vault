# Traveller's Clogs
*Wondrous item, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this pair of clogs, walking does not tire you as much. You are capable of walking 16 hours per day before being forced to make a Constitution saving throw against [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. After 16 hours, you must succeed on Constitution saving throws again like normal at the end of each hour, with the DC set as 10 + 1, for each hour past 16 hours.
