# Heart Scales
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This set of golden scales has an unremovable petrified heart placed on one side. If a body part of a creature (such as a lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.) is placed on the other side, this scale judges that creature's character and alignment. If that creature has an evil alignment, the scales will tip towards the body part. If that creature has a neutral alignment, the scales will remain balanced. If that creature has a good alignment, the scales will tip towards the heart.

If you are holding this item, you may focus on it while it has a creature's body part on the scale. So long as you remain in contact with this item, you automatically succeed any Wisdom (Insight) checks made against the creature whose body part is on the scale.
