# Breeze Nuts
*Herb, common, Herb*

- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A curious nut found attached to shrubby plants growing on windswept beaches. Said to appear in places where air elementals once stood, these nuts carry a weak wind magic within themselves. Although their limited effect may have little practicality, they do certainly aid in aesthetics, especially when wearing appropriately loose and billowing clothing.

## Effect:

As an action, you may eat this herb. For the next hour, you constantly generate a weak breeze that circles in a 5-foot radius around yourself.
