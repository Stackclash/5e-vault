# Mirror of Insecurity
*Wondrous item, cursed item, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This hand-held mirror has a frame sculpted from the jaw of a vargouille. Any humanoid that looks at themselves in the mirror sees a hideous and demonic version of their own reflection and must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, a humanoid is immune to the effects of this mirror for 24 hours. On a failure, that humanoid is cursed for 24 hours. While cursed, they fully believe that their demonic reflection is how they now look, despite any physical inspection that would imply otherwise. Whenever they see their own reflection anywhere while cursed in this way, they also see their demonic reflection.
