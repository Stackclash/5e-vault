# Moonwick Candle
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Moonwick-Candle.webp#right)  


This candle is made from a gritty wax that, when burnt, creates a cool blue flame. Its hollow silver base is shaped in a crescent with star-shaped holes punched in its sides. While the candle burns, the holes in its base softly glow, and small twinkles of starlight burst from the flickering flame.

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 15-foot radius. Each creature within the candle's light gains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet.

After burning for 1 hour, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.
