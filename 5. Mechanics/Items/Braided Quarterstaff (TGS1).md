- **Damage**:

- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magical quarterstaff is made of a tightly knit length of braided rope. As a bonus action, you can speak the weapon's command word to release its knotted form and loosen it into a 50-foot length of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hempen Rope 50 F(EET).md\|hempen rope]]. Speaking the command word again causes the rope to tighten back up into the quarterstaff. If a creature is restrained by the rope when you speak its command word, the rope tightens around the creature but does not crush it. Once tightened in this way, the restrained creature or an adjacent ally can use an action to escape following a successful DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (their choice).

Tying an object no larger than six inches on a side to the end the rope does not prevent it from reforming into the quarterstaff. The rope can only be broken by magical means. If broken, the rope cannot be transformed back into a quarterstaff.
