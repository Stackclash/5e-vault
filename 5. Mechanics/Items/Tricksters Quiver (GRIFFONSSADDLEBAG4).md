# Trickster's Quiver
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Tricksters-Quiver.webp#right)  


This quiver is a favorite among thieves and tricksters. When you're hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged attack using an arrow pulled from this quiver, making the attack doesn't reveal your position.

The quiver has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged weapon attack and pull a nonmagical arrow from the quiver, you can choose to expend 1 or more charges from the quiver to transform the arrow into a specialty one. The arrow magically transforms once it's fired from the weapon. A transformed arrow is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. There are four types of specialty arrows:

## Bolas (2 charges)

The arrow transforms into a spinning pair of bolas, which deal bludgeoning damage on a hit, instead of the arrow's normal damage type. If they hit a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the bolas until the start of your next turn.

## Choking Arrow (3 charges)

The arrow transforms into a sickly, smoking projectile. Hit or miss, any creature within 10 feet of the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, as a noxious cloud erupts from the arrow within that area. A creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much poison damage on a successful one. A creature hit by the arrow takes damage from the weapon plus the poison damage from the cloud of gas. A creature that fails the saving throw spends its action on its next turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. The cloud spreads around corners until the end of the turn, at which time the cloud disappears.

## Flare (1 charge)

The arrow transforms into a brilliant flame midair, which sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. On a hit, it deals fire damage instead of its normal type, and it continues to burn until the start of your next turn. When you fire the arrow, you can choose what color the flame is.

## Hookshot (1 charge)

The arrow transforms into a grappling hook and rope. On a hit, the target takes half as much damage from this arrow, and you're pulled up to 20 feet toward the target.

You can use this property of the quiver once per turn. A transformed arrow is destroyed at the start of your next turn.

Other types of ammunition containers of this kind exist, such as a trickster's bolt case meant for crossbow bolts, though quivers are most common.
