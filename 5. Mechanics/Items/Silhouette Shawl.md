# Silhouette Shawl
*Wondrous Item, common, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this shawl, you may spend your action to focus on your shadow. While focusing on your shadow, you may mentally command it to move around on the surface it is cast onto and to take any shape you wish, so long as you do not change its total surface area and the shadow keeps at least one point of contact with you at all times. Your shadow immediately returns to normal if you ever stop focusing on it or if you take off this shawl.
