# Mender's Mold
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A truly useful herb coveted by resource-deprived cave dwelling societies. This mold takes the appearance of a black sponge growing across the cave floor, and has the miraculous ability to transform its own cellular structure to mimic virtually any non-magical material in the Material Planes. It is believed that this ability is what has given rise to its ubiquity, as it is still able to release spores and propagate while in its transformed state, thus allowing it to spread wherever foraging creatures may have applied it.

## Effect:

This herb contains enough mold to cover `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) square feet. If you use this herb to cover a broken hole or seam in an object, the herb will magically adhere to the edges of the broken area and then permanently transform itself over the course of the next hour into the same materials as that on the edges it is touching. For example, if placed over a hole in a broken wooden floor, the mold will transform itself into wood. The mold retains its black colouration after the transformation and acts as a homogenous piece of material.
