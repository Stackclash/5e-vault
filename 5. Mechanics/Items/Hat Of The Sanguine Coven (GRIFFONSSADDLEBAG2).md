# Hat of the Sanguine Coven
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Hat-of-the-Sanguine-Coven.webp#right)  


This red hat is worn by a coven of witches known for their familiarity with death's doorstep. While wearing this hat, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] spell at will. Whenever you have 0 hit points while wearing this hat, you gain the following benefits:

- You stabilize or die after your sixth successful or failed death saving throw, instead of your third, but only succeed on the saving throw on a roll of 15 or higher.  
- When you roll a death saving throw, you can immediately cause the hat to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] spell (+5 to hit, no action required) against a creature within 30 feet of you that isn't behind total cover or heavily obscured. If it hits, you gain a +5 bonus to the saving throw.
