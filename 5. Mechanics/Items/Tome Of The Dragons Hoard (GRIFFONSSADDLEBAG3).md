# Tome of the Dragon's Hoard
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Tome-of-the-Dragons-Hoard.webp#right)  


This gilded tome is bound with a dragon wing's leather. When found, the book has `dice:10d10|noform|avg` (`10d10`) pages in it.

While holding the open book, you can use an action to speak its command word and press an object weighing no more than 25 pounds into one of its exposed pages. When you do, the object is magically transformed into a two-dimensional illustration of itself on the page. The number of objects you can store on a page in this way depends on its value in gold. A page can hold up to 5 objects on it whose total value is no more than 25 gp, such as an array of trinkets, trophies, or other mundane keepsakes. Alternatively, an object worth more than 25 gp, such as a satchel of coins or magical item, must be stored on its own page.

You can use an action to tear out a sheet from the book with one or more illustrations on it to cause all the illustrated objects from the page to materialize and appear on the ground within 5 feet of you.

Adding an object to the book causes it to grumble satisfyingly, whereas removing a page from it results in a threatening growl. Once all the book's pages have been torn from the tome, it loses its magic. Attempting to store a tome of the dragon's hoard on the page of another tome of the dragon's hoard causes both books' pages to tear themselves out of the books, destroying them, and sending any stored items contained by them toppling out of the pages around you. Similarly, storing a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Holding.md\|bag of holding]] or similar extradimensional item in the book causes the page it's placed in to immediately tear itself out of the book and spew the item onto the floor beside you again, wasting the page.
