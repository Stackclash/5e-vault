The following [[5. Mechanics/Items/Djinn And Tonic (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|djinn and tonic]] is a rare variant with additional properties. It also tastes better. When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gaseous Form.md\|gaseous form]] spell for 10 minutes (no concentration required) or until you end it early using an action. When the effect ends, your form rematerializes in a rush of air, forcing all Large and smaller creatures within 30 feet of you to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].
