This roughly hewn wooden staff cradles a wooden birdhouse at its top. A soft cooing noise can be heard from within the birdhouse. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties.

## Animal Messenger

You can use an action to expend 2 charges from the staff to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animal Messenger.md\|animal messenger]] spell. When cast in this way, instead of targeting a creature within range, you can cause a spectral courier pigeon to step from the staff's birdhouse to carry out the message. The pigeon disappears in a small cloud of feathers once the message has been delivered or if the magic is lost.

## Manifest Greater Pigeon

You can choose to expend 1 or more additional charges from the staff as part of the action to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animal Messenger.md\|animal messenger]] on the spectral courier pigeon. When you do, the spectral pigeon physically manifests, becoming material and visibly stronger.

For 1 extra charge, the pigeon becomes a Small creature. It covers twice as many miles within 24 hours, and it can deliver a small scrap of parchment or similarly sized item of negligible weight.

For 2 extra charges, the pigeon becomes a Medium creature. It covers three times as many miles within 24 hours, and it can deliver a small parcel weighing no more than 10 pounds.

For 3 extra charges, the pigeon becomes a Large creature. It covers four times as many miles within 24 hours, and it can deliver a larger parcel weighing no more than 25 pounds.

Regardless of the manifested pigeon's size, its statistics remain the same, and it refuses to move while another creature is sitting or otherwise mounted on it.

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge from the staff, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the birdhouse cracks apart and the staff's magic is lost.
