# Arcanist Gauntlets
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This pair of rich silk gloves is guarded by an enchanted mithral shell that sporadically releases arcane power. You can use the gauntlets as a spellcasting focus while wearing them, and when you cast a spell using a spell slot of 5th level or lower, you can choose to roll a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`). If you roll a number on the d6 equal to or greater than the spell's slot level, the spell draws on the magic within the gauntlets, instead of your own, and is cast without expending a spell slot. The slot must be of a level you can normally cast. The gauntlets can provide up to 5 levels worth of spell slots in this way each day, and no two slots can be the same level.

If the number rolled on the `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) is less than the spell slot's level, you cast the spell as normal and expend the spell slot. If you don't have the spell slot to cast the spell, the spell fails and the slot is counted toward the gauntlets' daily provided spell slots.

For example, a 9th-level wizard can use the gauntlets to provide either one 5th-level spell slot or a 4th- and 1st-level spell slot over the course of a day, but not two 2nd- or 3rd-level spell slots.
