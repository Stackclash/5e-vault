# Starmetal Flail
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Flail.md\|flail]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Starmetal-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This flail has no connecting chain between its handle and bludgeon. Instead, it's magically tethered a set distance apart through the metal's magical magnetism, causing the weapon's weight to be negligible. A small, star-like furnace rages inside the weapon, causing it to roar aflame whenever it's swung.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which also has the finesse property. Targets hit by the weapon take an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage, as the fire within it burns with meteoric heat.

The weapon can be used to make ranged weapon attacks by flinging the bludgeon farther away than its normal reach, using either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls when you do. The attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet. The first time on each of your turns that you hit a target farther than 30 feet away from you with the bludgeon, the weapon's extra fire damage is doubled as the bludgeon continues to erupt in flames. Immediately after the attack, the bludgeon returns to the flail.
