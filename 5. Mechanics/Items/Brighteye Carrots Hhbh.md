# Brighteye Carrots
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

These pale-yellow carrots can be found by looking in the few patches of a predominantly dark environment that have been touched by sunlight. Their presence below the earth is signified by the telltale grey stalks they shoot above the surface which redirect precious sunlight into the carrots themselves. When dried, powdered, mashed, and then rubbed onto the areas around one's eyes, they provide a level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#darkvision\|darkvision]] to those that would normally be useless in the dark.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after you apply this herb, you gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet, and your eyes shed a dim light in a 5-foot radius.
