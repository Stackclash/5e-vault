# Pop-Up Business Card
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Pop-up-Business-Card.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This two-by-three-inch paper card somehow weighs 1 pound and feels like it's made of wood and metal. It looks like a wooden shop sign with a painted lantern on either side.

You can use an action to toss the card to a point on the ground within 10 feet of you and speak its command word. The card then magically unfolds to instantly reveal a wooden market stall. A lawful neutral goblin merchant stands behind the stall, who has at least one piece of each type of adventuring gear for sale, as listed in the Basic Rules. The goblin also has `dice:1d4-1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4 - 1`) potions of healing, and is unwilling to barter, haggle, or buy anything offered to it.

When the goblin senses that there's no more business to be done, it snaps its fingers and disappears in a puff of smoke, along with the stall. If the goblin is harmed, both it and the stall immediately disappear. In either case, the card is then destroyed.
