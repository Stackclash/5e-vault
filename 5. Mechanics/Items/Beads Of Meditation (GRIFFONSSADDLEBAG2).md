# Beads of Meditation
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Beads-of-Meditation.webp#right)  


This beaded necklace can be used as a set of prayer beads or special rosary. While wearing or holding the beads, you can use an action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]].

If you're a cleric, monk, or paladin, you can use an action to hold onto the beads to further channel your spirituality. If you're a monk, you regain `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended ki points. If you're a cleric or paladin, you regain one use of your Channel Divinity. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
