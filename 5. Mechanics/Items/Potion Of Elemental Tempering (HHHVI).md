# Potion of Elemental Tempering
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you become comfortable even if you are in extreme weather. For the next 24 hours, you automatically succeed any saving throw against [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] triggered by being in an extremely cold or an extremely hot environment. This potion is constantly bubbling as if boiling and also has a small shard of ice in it that never melts despite the ambient temperature.
