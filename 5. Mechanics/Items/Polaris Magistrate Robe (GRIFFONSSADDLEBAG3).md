# Polaris Magistrate Robe
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a lawful creature)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Polaris-Magistrate-Robe.webp#right)  


These robes are worn by the elected officials of Polaris, a floating city held aloft by astral magic. While wearing the robe, you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], and you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) checks made to determine if a creature is lying. In addition, you can choose to intensify your voice at will, causing it to boom up to three times as loud as normal each time you speak.
