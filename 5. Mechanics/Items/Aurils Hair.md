# Auril's Hair
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

Named for the goddess of cold, this plant is every bit as sharp and wicked as its namesake. Resembling icicles rising from the ground, auril's hair is actually a flowering plant that sheds all of its greenery during the winter months, leaving just a sharp, icy blue stalk behind. In order to protect the important structures within this stalk, it has developed a remarkable ability to absorb and disperse the cold wherever it goes, much like the capricious Frostmaiden herself.

## Effect:

As an action, you may stab this stalk into the ground. If you do so, all the ground within 20 feet of you becomes covered in a thin layer of ice, causing it to become difficult terrain for the next 10 minutes (or half that if done in a hot environment). This stalk may be used in this way up to 3 times, after which it loses all of its stored cold energy and becomes useless.
