# Spirit-Shaking Salt
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Spirit-Shaking-Salt.webp#right)  


This glass salt shaker has a silver skull top and is filled with `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) uses of spirit-shaking salt. While holding the shaker, you can use an action to shake it: you can either cast the salt away from you or sprinkle it on a creature within 5 feet of you.

## Cast

When you cast the salt away from you, any undead with the Incorporeal Movement trait within 10 feet of you is shunted to the Ethereal Plane (if it isn't already there) and can't enter the Material Plane for 1 minute.

## Sprinkle

When you sprinkle the salt on a possessed creature, the possession immediately ends.
