# Trap Sweeper
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Trap-Sweeper.webp#right)  


You can use an action to speak this broom's command word and sweep the ground with it. When you do, dirt and dust is kicked up by the broom in a 30-foot cone originating from it. The dirt and dust magically glows and clings to the edges of any trap, clearly outlining it for all to see. The trap remains outlined in this way for 1 minute.

Once the broom has been used to sweep for the third time in this way, it can't do so again until `dice:1d4-1|noform|avg` (`1d4 - 1`) days have passed. If you roll a 1 on the `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`), the broom regains all uses of this property and can be used again immediately.

A trap, for the purpose of this item, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the item would sense an area affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Alarm.md\|alarm]] spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
