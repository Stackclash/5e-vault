# Phantom Lance
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance.md\|lance]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Phantom-Lance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 O
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Special%20Weapons\|special]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This lance becomes shrouded in ghostly energy whenever it's thrust. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals force damage instead of piercing damage. While the lance is on your person, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Phantom Steed.md\|phantom steed]] spell from it, but only as a ritual.

## Ghostly Charge

When you walk 20 or more feet in a straight line on your turn, you can immediately use an action to summon a ghostly steed from beneath you. The steed then charges up to 80 more feet in that same line, which is 5 feet wide, with you mounted atop it. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Make an attack roll with the lance against a target within 10 feet of the end of the line. You have advantage on the attack roll.

In addition, any creature in the steed's line must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take `dice:3d12|noform|avg` (`3d12`) force damage and be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. If you hit the target at the end of the line with the lance, that target must also make the saving throw: it does so with disadvantage.

The steed vanishes immediately after the attack. If you roll a 12 on any of the d12s for the damage of this attack or effect, this property can be used again. Otherwise, this property can't be used again until the next dusk.
