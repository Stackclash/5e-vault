# Frozen Skull
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While holding this skull, you may spend your action to release a pulse of winter. All creatures within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have their speed reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. A creature may make the saving throw again at the end of their turn, ending the effect on themselves on a success. A creature that is resistant or immune to cold damage automatically succeeds this saving throw.

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
