# Gibbering Candle
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Gibbering-Candle.webp#right)  


This oozing, red wax candle provides the same light as a normal candle. Twisted faces contort ever worse as the candle melts. A creature within the candle's light hears a telepathic and incoherent babbling, which gets louder as you near the candle. When a creature that can see the candle enters the candle's light for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] until the start of its next turn; a creature makes this saving throw with disadvantage if it's within the candle's bright light. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] in this way can only move toward the candle for the rest of the turn. Unless [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Surprised\|surprised]], a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the candle or anything within its light until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the candle or something within its light in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 1 hour, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 10 minutes from the candle's total burn time.
