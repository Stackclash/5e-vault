# Mimic Gel
*Potion, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This vial contains enough gel to cover an item no larger than one square foot in surface area. Completely covering an item in this gel and then leaving it for an hour causes it to meld with the gel, giving it a permanent enchantment. While a creature is holding an item melded with mimic gel, they may spend an action to change its appearance to anything else of the same approximate size and configuration. This appearance change is an illusion only and fails to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature can use its action to inspect the item and discern its true nature by succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check.
