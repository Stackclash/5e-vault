# Ice Sickle
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Sickle.md\|sickle]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ice-Sickle.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magic sickle from the Everglacier is perpetually covered in tiny, needle-like icicles along its edge that reform almost as soon as they're gone. The first target hit by this weapon on each of your turns takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage from the attack.
