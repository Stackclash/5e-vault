# Psionic Crystal
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/psionic-crystal.jpg#right)  


Chipped off the hide of a gemstone dragon, this crystal grants you psionic abilities depending on its size. It recharges upon completing a long rest. If you ever use the last charge, it turns into an inert precious stone.
