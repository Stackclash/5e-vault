*Melee Weapon, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Damage**: 1d10 P
- **Properties**: Crafted by, Heavy, Martial, Reach, Two-handed
- **Weight**: 18.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. When you hit a target with this weapon on your turn, you may immediately use your bonus action to attempt to grapple them, using this weapon instead of a free hand. If your target is a creature with less than half of its maximum hit points, your grapple check is made with advantage, and if it is successful, your target is considered restrained as well.

While you have a creature grappled in this way, you may not make attacks with this weapon.
