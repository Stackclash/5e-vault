This golden axe is enchanted with haphazard divination magic. Its split blade features a spade, club, heart, and diamond on each of its four faces. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a target with this weapon, you can choose to roll a second `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) before calculating the weapon's damage. If you roll an 11 or higher on the second `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`), the blade magically seeks out and hits the weakest point of the target, turning the attack into a critical hit. On a roll of 10 or lower, the blade ricochets harmlessly off the original target and scores a critical hit against you, instead. When the axe hits you in this way, its damage ignores resistances and immunity.
