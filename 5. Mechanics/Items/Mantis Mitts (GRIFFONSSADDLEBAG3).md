# Mantis Mitts
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mantis-Mitts.webp#right)  


These bulky mitts magically increase the swiftness of your punches to supersonic speeds; punching with them creates a momentary vacuum behind each strike. The mitts are coated with a rainbow iridescence that shifts between a full spectrum of colors.

While wearing the mitts, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes using your fists, which use a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes (unless it's already higher). A target hit with them takes thunder damage, instead of bludgeoning damage. If you're underwater, the damage die is a `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) and deals fire damage, which isn't reduced as a result of being underwater. In addition, the reach of your unarmed strikes is increased by 5 feet (provided you're using your fists), or 10 feet if you're underwater. You don't suffer the negative effects of underwater combat when you make an attack using the mitts.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll for an unarmed strike using your fists while wearing the mitts, the target must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hypnotic Pattern.md\|hypnotic pattern]] spell.
