# Gibberbox
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Gibberbox.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

This magic box is made of enamel and bits of bone that stick together with the gummy, red remains of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Gibbering Mouther.md\|gibbering mouther]]. The box weighs 7 pounds and is 1 foot long and 6 inches wide and tall. You can open the box's wooden lid as an action. When you do, the red paste inside the box swirls and forms a toothy mouth that starts incessantly babbling nonsense. Every creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the box that can hear it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack. A creature takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage if it touches the red paste and toothy mouth while the box is opened and blathering in this way.

This effect lasts for 1 minute or until the box's lid is closed again using an action. Once this property of the box has been used, it can't be used again for 24 hours. Opening the lid again while this property is inactive results in a droning, gurgling sound that turns silent after 1 minute of the box being open. The paste is extremely elastic and can't be removed or separated from the box.
