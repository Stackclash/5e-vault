# Lifestealer's Mask
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this mask, if a creature you can see within 60 feet of you attempts to regain hit points, you may spend your reaction to force it to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, that creature gains no hit points, and any that it would have gained is instead restored to you as temporary hit points.
