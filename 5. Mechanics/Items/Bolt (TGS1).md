This heavy crossbow is made of metal and fires small bolts of electricity instead of normal ammunition. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you pull the string back to load the crossbow, the string crackles with energy and loads a small bolt of lightning ammunition instead. Attacks made with this crossbow deal `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) lightning damage instead of 1d10 piercing. In addition, whenever you make a ranged attack with this weapon against a metal target or a creature wearing metal armor, you make the attack with advantage.

This crossbow acts as a small lightning rod. If another creature within 10 feet of you takes lightning damage while you're holding the crossbow, you take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage for every 10 lightning damage the other creature took.
