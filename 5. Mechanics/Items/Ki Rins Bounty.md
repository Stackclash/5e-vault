# Ki-Rin's Bounty
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

A strain of gingko tree with leaves that shine as bright as gold and which always seems to have a holy radiance from within its branches. Archaeological findings have shown that these trees were once ubiquitous throughout the land. However, the constant coveting of their beauty and the medicinal value of their leaves led to their overharvesting. Today, only a handful remain in a few hard to reach places. Some believe that the trees were originally created by the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Ki Rin.md\|ki-rin]] as a blessing to the world, and they in turn now protect the last of them by only revealing their location to those they deem worthy.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, anytime a dice would be rolled to restore hit points to yourself, the highest value of that dice is used instead. For example, instead of restoring `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) hit points, you would regain `dice: 12|avg` (`12`) hit points. If an effect would restore hit points to both you and another creature simultaneously, a separate dice roll is made as normal for them.

> The idea that the ki-rin vanish and hide these trees is absolute hogwash. The simple answer is that the leaves actually contain a mild intoxicating element that when ingested, leads to feelings of both euphoria (explaining the fantastical descriptions of them) as well as short term-memory loss. In other words, it's not that the trees are vanishing after imparting a miracle to the blessed few that find themâ€”people are simply getting drunk on the leaves, wandering off, then forgetting where they found them.
