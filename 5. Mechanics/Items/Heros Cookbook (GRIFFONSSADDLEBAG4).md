# Hero's Cookbook
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Heros-Cookbook.webp#right)  


In the front of this well-worn book is a magical incantation. Reciting the incantation reveals that it's a song to cook to, and follows a catchy melody. The rest of the book is filled with various persons' handwritten recipes and scrawled notes, which all include some form of meat from a creature they'd slain. You can refer to the book's writings to gain a +3 bonus to any check made using [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cooks Utensils.md\|cook's utensils]].

Alternatively, you can recite the incantation while you cook a recipe from the book. The resulting dish must include meat from either an aberration, beast, dragon, or monstrosity. It takes 1 hour to cook a dish, which creates a number of rations equal to four times the number of pounds of meat you cooked (to a maximum of 12 rations). If the cooked creature had a challenge rating of 1 or more, a creature that eats one of the rations in full gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made against creatures of the cooked one's type for 8 hours or until the next time it eats a ration. If a ration isn't eaten within 24 hours, it loses this effect. Once this property of the book has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
