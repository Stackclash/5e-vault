This magic handaxe is made from the remains of a slain axe beak. The first time you hit a creature that has a flying speed on each of your turns with this axe, that creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Each time that a creature fails this saving throw, that creature's flying speed is reduced by 15 feet for 1 minute.
