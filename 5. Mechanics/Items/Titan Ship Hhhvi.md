# Titan Ship
*Airship, Vehicle (air), artifact, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This ship's hull is formed from the shell of a tarrasque and shares much of its properties. The ship is 30 feet wide, 70 feet long, and 20 feet high. It possesses 3 sails and can travel at 2 1/2 mph in a good wind. The ship has 25 AC, 500 HP, can house 60 passengers, carry 200 tons of cargo and has a damage threshold of 20.

In addition, this ship is immune to fire damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. If the [[5. Mechanics/Vehicles/Titan Ship Hhhvi.md\|titan ship]] is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a `dice: d6|avg` (`d6`). On a 1 to 5, the ship is unaffected. On a 6, the ship is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the ship, turning the caster into the target.

> Also available as a [[5. Mechanics/Vehicles/Titan Ship Hhhvi.md\|vehicle.]]
