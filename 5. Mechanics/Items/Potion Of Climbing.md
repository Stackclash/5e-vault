# Potion of Climbing
*Potion, minor, common*  


When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.
