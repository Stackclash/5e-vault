# Helm of the Illithid
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this helmet, you have telepathy out to a range of 120 feet. In addition, you may spend an action to magically emit psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take `dice: 4d8|avg` (`4d8`) psychic damage and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
