You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d4+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) expended charges daily at dusk. While holding this pike, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mirror Image.md\|mirror image]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Phantom Steed.md\|phantom steed]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Dead.md\|speak with dead]] (1 charge), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spirit Guardians.md\|spirit guardians]] (2 charges).

## Spectral Warrior

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this pike, you can choose to summon a spectral warrior from the weapon. Until the start of your next turn, that creature is haunted by the warrior. While haunted, a creature has disadvantage on weapon attacks against you. This property has no effect against undead creatures.

## Haunting Phalanx

You can use an action while holding this pike to expend 3 of its charges and point it forward commandingly. Five spectral, pike-wielding warriors appear before you and march in a 25-foot by 50-foot line in a direction you choose. Any creature within that line's area must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d10`) necrotic damage and `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d10`) psychic damage and is affected by the weapon's *spectral warrior* property. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't affected by the spectral warriors. Undead creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw.
