- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This mirror-like shield is enchanted with abjuration magic that can reflect spells back at their source. While holding the shield, you can use it as a reaction when hit by an attack to cast the shield spell from it. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

The shield has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges each day at dawn. When you succeed on a saving throw to resist the effects of a spell that targets only you or are missed by a spell attack, you can use your reaction to learn the level of the spell. As part of your reaction, you can expend a number of the shield's charges equal to the level of the spell (up to 6th level) to reflect that spell back at its source. You can't reflect a spell of 7th level or higher. When you reflect a spell in this way, the caster of the spell must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage for each expended charge as a bolt of reflected arcane energy hits them. On a successful save, the damage is halved. If you reflect a spell in this way that would cause you to take half damage on a successful save, you take no damage instead.
