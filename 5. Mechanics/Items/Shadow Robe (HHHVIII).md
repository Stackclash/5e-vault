# Shadow Robe
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This robe constantly billows wisps of protective shadow as if it were smoke. While wearing this robe, you have a +1 bonus to AC, and if you are in dim light or darkness, creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you.
