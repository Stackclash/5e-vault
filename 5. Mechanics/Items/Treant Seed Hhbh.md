# Treant Seed
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

As protectors of nature and the natural cycle, the tree guardians known as 'treants' are well aware of the necessity of their own eventual deaths. While most take the end of their service with calm acceptance, on occasion, they will leave behind a single glowing seed upon their demise. Usually this occurs when a treant feels its domain is under threat and there are no other trees close to awakening to take up its vigil. Indeed, this seed contains a concentration of all of the treant's will and power, granting its strength to whomever may take it, in the hopes that they use it to serve the forest it failed to protect.

## Effect:

When you use this herb, you transform into a treant [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (as outlined in the Monster Manual)], with all your equipment melding into your new form and unavailable to use until this effect ends. If you do not have room to grow into your new form, the transformation reverts immediately and the herb is wasted. While a treant, you retain your alignment, proficiencies, knowledge, spellcasting, and class abilities, but replace all other features with that of the treant, including hit points. You return to your normal form after 4 hours, or if you drop to 0 hit points, at which point you revert immediately, with any excess damage carrying over to your normal form.
