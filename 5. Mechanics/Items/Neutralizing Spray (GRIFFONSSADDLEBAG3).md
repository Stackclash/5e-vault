# Neutralizing Spray
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Neutralizing-Spray.webp#right)  


This small bottle contains a mysterious clear liquid. It has an inflated cushion on its stopper that can be squeezed to spray the liquid from a small nozzle. You can use an action to spray the bottle into a space within 5 feet of you, dousing the area in a 5-foot cube. Any creature or object within the area becomes magically cleaned, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Prestidigitation.md\|prestidigitation]] spell, and if it would still have an odor even after being cleaned, the smell is suppressed for 10 minutes.

The bottle contains enough liquid for 4 uses and regains any used liquid daily at dawn. If you use the last of the liquid, roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`). On a 1, the liquid no longer magically replenishes.
