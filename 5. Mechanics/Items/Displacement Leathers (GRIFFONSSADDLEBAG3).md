# Displacement Leathers
*Light armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Leather Armor.md\|leather armor]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Displacement-Leathers.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 11 + Dex modifier
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This armor creates a blurry afterimage of you while you move. When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while wearing this armor, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) (no action required). On an 11 or higher, the attack misses and hits a nearby illusion of you instead. On a 10 or lower, the attack hits you. Once this property of the armor has been used for the fourth time, it can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
