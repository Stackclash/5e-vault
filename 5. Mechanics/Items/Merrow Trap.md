# Merrow Trap
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

An extremely common type of seagrass found all over the ocean, this plant unfortunately has very strong ties to the predatory [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Merrow.md\|merrow]] that utilise its long stalks as both an ambush point and as a disorienting environment to trap their prey. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Merrow.md\|merrow]] have also been known to use the grass as fletching on their weapons, using the grass' natural hydrodynamics to make their projectiles more effective underwater.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d20|avg` (`1d20`) charges, with each charge corresponding to a blade of seagrass. You may expend 1 charge and spend 1 minute attaching a blade of seagrass to a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crossbow Bolt.md\|bolt]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Arrow.md\|arrow]]. If you do so, that bolt or arrow suffers no penalties associated with being used underwater.
