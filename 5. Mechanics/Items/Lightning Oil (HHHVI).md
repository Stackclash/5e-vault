# Lightning Oil
*Oil, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

A line of lightning constantly crackles through this bottle of cloudy grey liquid. A dose of this oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) lightning damage on a successful hit.

This bottle has enough liquid in it for 3 doses.
