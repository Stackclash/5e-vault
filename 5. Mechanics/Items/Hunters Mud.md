# Hunter's Mud
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Technically this is not a plant, but rather a portion of mud that has had the leaves of the *olfactaria sphagnum* moss decompose inside of it. The result is a special mud that completely blocks and neutralises any odours on one's body. It is common to find this mud in the satchels of many hunters that coat themselves with it in order to mask their scent from skittish prey with strong senses of smells.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, you do not produce a smell, and any odours that attempt to cling to you are instantly neutralised.
