# Blossoming Arrow
*Ammunition ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Arrow.md\|arrow]]), minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Blossoming-Arrow.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

This twig-like arrow is fletched with split leaves and dotted with tiny blossoms. Its point is a complicated, bulb-like mass, which seems to cover a collection of strange glowing pustules at its center.

A creature hit by this arrow takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage from the attack, or `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) if the creature is a plant, and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 hour. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] creature gains the plant type, in addition to its other creature types, for as long as it remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]]. After the arrow deals this poison damage, it loses its magic.

Alternatively, if the arrow is planted or otherwise stuck in soil and left to rest for 30 days, it magically transforms into an awakened tree at the end of that time. This awakened tree is immune to poison damage and is covered in small, beautiful flowers. Until the arrow transforms into a tree in this way, you can remove it from the soil to use it as an arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as blossoming bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
