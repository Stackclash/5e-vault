# Disruptor
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Longsword.md\|longsword]]), very rare (requires attunement by a chaotic creature)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/disruptor.jpg#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 slashing
  - Two-handed: 1d10 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

If you are a neutral character, this dull grey longsword functions as a normal weapon with no bonus or special properties. If you are lawful, touching Disruptor deals `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage to you. If you are a chaotic character, you can use Disruptor as a magic weapon with the following properties.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus increases to +3 against lawful creatures. If an attack with Disruptor reduces a creature to 0 hit points, their chest bursts open and their organs spill out.

Whenever you score a critical hit with Disruptor, roll a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) on the Court of All Flesh row of the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Servitors (SAF).md\|Servitors]] chart (page 31). The critical hit lops a limb off the enemy's body, and the rolled servitor spawns from the severed flesh. This servitor fights for you and obeys your commands. They return to Morphosis ^[Capital city of Primordius, the Sea of Change, the plane of uttermost chaos.] after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points.
