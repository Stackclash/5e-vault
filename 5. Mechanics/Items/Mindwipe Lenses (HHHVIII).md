# Mindwipe Lenses
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

These lenses have 10 charges. While wearing and attuned to these lenses, you may expend those charges to do any of the following.

## Devil's Sight

You may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to enhance your vision with fiendish energy. For the next hour, you have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet, and magical darkness doesn't impede your vision.

## Spellcasting

You may spend your action and a number of charges to cast any of the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Person.md\|charm person]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Command.md\|command]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Person.md\|dominate person]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Monster.md\|dominate monster]] (8 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feeblemind.md\|feeblemind]] (9 charges). These spells are cast using your spell save DC. If you do not have one, the DC is set to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.

## Poison Mind

You may use an action to expend 3 charges to target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you or expend 5 charges to target two creatures instead. Targeted creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:4d12|noform|avg` (`4d12`) necrotic damage and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the start of your next turn.

## Forgetfulness

You may use an action to expend 4 charges to target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours.

These lenses recover all expended charges daily at dawn.
