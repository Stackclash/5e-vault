# Tracker's Leaf
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

A fairly common leaf found on bushes throughout grasslands, it has a strong smell when crushed which is reminiscent of menthol mixed with formaldehyde. This potent combination causes the olfactory senses to temporarily enter overdrive, allowing the user to smell things that they would not otherwise.

## Effect:

As an action, you may crush this leaf and smell it. If you do so, your sense of smell improves drastically for the next 10 minutes, granting you advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks made that rely on smell.

> There is a unique torture method that I once had the misfortune of experiencing which involves the forced use of tracker's leaf and then locking the poor individual in a small space with a foul smelling substance such as rotting meat. In my case, I was kept with a bag of my own clothes, which I had not had a chance to wash during a several month-long journey (for a more detailed depiction, read 'Hamund's Harrows XIII').
