# Chain of Violence
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This 20-foot metal chain has one hook on either end. As an action, you may throw one end of this chain at a target within 20 feet of you, forcing them to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or suffer `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage and have the hook lodge itself in their body. If the hook lodges itself in a target, the hook on the end that you hold automatically lodges itself in your own body, dealing `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage to you as well and chaining you and your target together.

While chained in this way, neither creature may willingly move more than 20 feet away from the other and they may not take any action that does not involve attempting to damage the other chained creature. The hooks can only be removed once at least one of the chained creatures dies, or another creature adjacent to one of the chained creatures removes the hook from their body with a successful DC 16 Strength check, at which point the other hook will also automatically dislodge.
