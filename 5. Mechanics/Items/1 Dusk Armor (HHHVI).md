# +1 Dusk Armor
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this armor, you have a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, while wearing this armor in dim light or darkness, you may take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action as a bonus action. If you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action in this way, you do not suffer the usual penalty that normally applies to Stealth (Dexterity) checks made in plate armor.
