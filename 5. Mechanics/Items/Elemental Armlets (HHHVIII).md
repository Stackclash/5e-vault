# Elemental Armlets
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you become attuned to these armlets, you may choose one of the following damage types: fire, cold, lightning, or thunder. If you do so, all of your weapon attacks are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity, and you may choose to deal their damage using your chosen damage type instead of their original ones. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit, you deal an additional `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) of damage of your chosen damage type (this damage is not doubled).

You may change your chosen damage type at any time by focusing on these armlets for 10 minutes.
