# Yellow Harbinger's Path
*Major, very rare (requires attunement by a creature with a Dexterity score of 17 or higher)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Yellow-Harbingers-Path.webp#right)  


This burnt yellow armor is the mark of a royal scout. Its magical construction is unyielding to all but the most lithe and capable of scouts and huntsmen.

While wearing the armor, you gain a +5 bonus to any Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) check you make. While you have more than half your Hit Dice remaining, you can choose to expend 2 of them as an action to extend this property to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you for 1 hour. When you do, each affected creature, including yourself, has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature only benefits from this effect if it remains within 30 feet of you.

The armor has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use one of the following properties:

## "At Arrow's Length!"

When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you uses its reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to summon a spectral arrow from the air above it. The arrow flies harmlessly in front of the attacking creature and disappears, distracting them from the attack and causing the roll to be made with disadvantage. If the attacking creature has [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]], this property has no effect. If you're concentrating on the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hunters Mark.md\|hunter's mark]] spell, you can choose to move your mark to this creature as part of your reaction.

Alternatively, if a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to immediately move up to half your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

## "From Sky to Earth!"

As an action, you can expend 4 charges from the armor to summon a volley of spectral arrows from the sky, choosing a point that you can see within 120 feet of you when you do. The arrows fall in a 30-foot radius, 60-foot high cylinder centered on that point and then disappear. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## "There Is No Escape!"

You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 of the armor's charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hunters Mark.md\|hunter's mark]] spell from it. If you choose to expend 2 charges, you cast the spell at 3rd level, or 5th level if you choose to expend 3.

## Flaw

The Yellow Harbinger's path compels its wearer to be cautious and overprepared. While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: "I am duty-bound to lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty is unacceptable." In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Red Queens Burden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Red Queen's burden]] or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Violet Kings Promise (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Violet King's promise]]. If you're already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your field commander, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Red Queens Burden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Red Queen's burden]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Violet Kings Promise (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Violet King's promise]] without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell, but not while you are attuned to the armor.
