# Wand of the Dragon Queen
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wand-of-the-Dragon-Queen.webp#right)  


Five chromatic dragon heads coil up toward the tip of this wand, which has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to release a gout of dragon's breath from the wand. For 1 charge, the area of dragon's breath is a 15-foot cone. You can increase the size of the cone by 5 feet for each additional charge you expend. Each creature in the breath's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) acid damage, `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) cold damage, `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage, `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) lightning damage, and `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand is consumed by its own elements and is destroyed.
