# Nomad's Treasure
*Herb, common*

- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

These pinky nail-sized seeds are recognisable by their waxy brown exterior and distinctive drop shape. When swallowed whole, they release a mouthful of fresh juice that actually provides all the hydration that the average humanoid needs in a day. While botanists have yet to figure out where these plants come from, the reigning theory is that they are the result of magical incursions and weaknesses between planes that result in certain places temporarily touching the Elemental Plane of Water. These seeds then spawn close to the surface of the sand, ready to be picked by whatever wandering creature is lucky enough to forage them. They are so prevalent and useful, that some desert cultures have taken to using them as currency in place of gold.

## Effect:

When you apply this herb, you are considered to have drunk a day's worth of fresh water.
