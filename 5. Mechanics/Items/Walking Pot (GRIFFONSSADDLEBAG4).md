# Walking Pot
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Walking-Pot.webp#right)  


This terra cotta pot has an emerald, scale-like glaze along its base. Four legs protrude from the bottom of the vessel, as well as an unblinking, humanoid face. If at least one plant is growing within the pot, the pot will magically animate to walk to the nearest location that's within 120 feet of where it was last placed that's best for the plant's needs (such as sunlight or water). The pot ceases to be animated once it reaches the location. While it's animated, the pot has a walking speed of 10 feet.
