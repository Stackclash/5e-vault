# Oaken Candle
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Oaken-Candle.webp#right)  


This magic, bark-like candle emits a green flame when burned, which sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. You can light the candle as an action. After burning for `dice:1d8+4|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 4`) hours, the candle is destroyed and an oak tree no more than 30 feet tall grows in its place over the course of 10 minutes. If there isn't enough room for a tree to grow or the candle isn't placed on solid ground, the candle is destroyed without creating a tree.
