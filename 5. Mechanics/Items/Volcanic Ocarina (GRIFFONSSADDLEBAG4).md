# Volcanic Ocarina
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Volcanic-Ocarina.webp#right)  


This stone ocarina is always hot to the touch. When playing it, harmless molten rock spews upward from any uncovered finger hole.

There are three magical melodies that can be played on the ocarina, which each create a different volcanic effect. Once a melody has been played, the ocarina shouldn't be used to play one of these melodies again until the next dawn. Each time it is used to play such a melody again before then, the ocarina has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and dissolving into molten rock in your hands, destroying itself and dealing `dice:5d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d10`) fire damage to you when this occurs.

## Erupting Melody

When you play this melody, choose four different points on the ground that you can see within 60 feet of you. A pillar of flame bursts upward from each point, provided that the ocarina's sound can reach it. A creature within 5 feet of each point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one of these eruptions is affected only once.

## Molten Melody

When you play this melody, choose a stone or earthen structure that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the sound of the ocarina can reach the structure, it harmlessly dissolves into a pile of molten earth, which immediately cools at the end of the effect. The dissolved area of the structure can be no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.

## Seismic Melody

When you play this melody, choose a point on the ground that you can see within 60 feet of you. The ground then shakes, like an earthquake, in a 20-foot-radius circle that's centered on that point. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and take `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage. A 10-foot-deep fissure then opens immediately after in a straight line, which runs through the center of the circle. The line is 5 feet wide and up to 40 feet long. Any creature within the line must succeed on an additional DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet down into the fissure. A creature that failed the saving throw for the earthquake makes this second saving throw with disadvantage.
