This magic crossbow carries a small system of curious tubes and vessels. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The crossbow has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon's charges when you make an attack with it to coat the fired bolt with a unique, self-generating venom. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.

If you expend the crossbow's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the vessels attached to the crossbow shatter and spray poison in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on your location. Creatures within the sphere take `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. When this happens, the crossbow ceases to be magical and loses all of its additional properties.
