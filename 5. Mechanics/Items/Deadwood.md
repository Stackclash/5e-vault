# Deadwood
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A grey-coloured wood found littering the forest floor, and is usually the result of minor enchantment magic cast in a dying tree's vicinity. When brewed into a tea, it has a rather pronounced calmative effect.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, your emotions remain completely calm, and only change if you are subjected to an effect that would magically change them.
