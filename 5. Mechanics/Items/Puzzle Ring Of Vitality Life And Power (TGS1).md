# Puzzle Ring of Vitality, Life, and Power
*Ring, major, legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)*

## The Inner Ring

This golden ring is blessed by a god of life and healing. While wearing the ring, you can use your [Lay On Hands](compendium/classes/paladin.md#Lay%20on%20Hands%20(Level%201)) feature on an ally within 10 feet of you instead of needing to touch them.

## The Outer Ring

The inner ring is covered by a silver puzzle ring that grants various benefits. The puzzle ring is made of three distinct bands that, when fit together in an elaborate and ever-changing puzzle, cause you to emanate a 30-foot aura that heals and supports your allies. As an action, you can make an Intelligence check to solve a piece of the puzzle in a fixed order:

- The first band slides into place following a successful DC 5 Intelligence check. Once solved, you begin to emit the ring's aura. The aura lasts for 1 minute and is always centered on you. While you emit this aura, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause a creature within the aura (including you) to regain `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) hit points.  
- The second band is solved following a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. When it slides into place, the aura's strength increases. Each living, nonhostile creature regains 1 hit point when it starts its turn in the aura with 0 hit points. In addition, creatures within the radius have resistance against necrotic damage, and their hit point maximum can't be reduced.  
- The third and final band is solved following a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. When the band fits into place to complete the puzzle, the aura's power is maximized. Friendly creatures within the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, and if succeeding on a saving throw in this way would normally cause the creature to take half damage, it takes no damage instead.  

The aura ends early if you take the ring off or are reduced to 0 hit points. Once the aura fades, you can't activate the outer ring again until 1 day has passed for each band that you solved. If you solve all 3 bands, the number of days is reduced by `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`). On a 3, the outer ring can be activated again immediately.
