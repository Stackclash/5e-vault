# Maiden Moss
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

Strangely for a moss, this herb grows quite long, thin, and yellow, causing it to usually be mistaken for grass (or the hair of a beautiful maiden). It can be found growing around the bases of large trees and serves to keep parasites and harmful insects away from them, in exchange for a stable place to grow and propagate. When dried, ground into a powder, and mixed with some bodily fluids, it has a repellent effect on wild creatures.

## Effect:

As part of preparing this herb, you must expend 1 vial of blood from a creature of your choosing and use it to create a paste from the powder ground from the herb. The resulting paste may then be applied to either one creature that is sized medium or smaller, or to the perimeter of an area that measures no more than 60 feet. For the next 24 hours, any creature that is the same creature type of the blood you added to the paste and that has an Intelligence score of 5 or less must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever they attempt to move within 5 feet of the creature or area surrounded by the paste. On a failure, that creature must spend the rest of their movement moving as far away from the creature or area surrounded by paste as they can, taking the most direct, safe route possible. If they succeed, they may move as they wish and they are immune to the effects of this herb for the next 24 hours.
