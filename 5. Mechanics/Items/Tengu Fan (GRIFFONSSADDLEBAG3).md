# Tengu Fan
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Tengu-Fan.webp#right)  


Typically carried by oni, a tengu fan functions as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wind Fan.md\|wind fan]] with the following changes:

Its save DC is 15, instead of 13.

It can be used twice before the next dawn, instead of once, without the risk of destroying it. However, when it's used for a third time or more, the cumulative chance to be destroyed is 50 percent, instead of 20.

When used to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gust Of Wind.md\|gust of wind]] spell, razor-sharp leaves fill the line of wind. A creature that fails the saving throw against the wind at the start of its turn also takes `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) slashing damage from the sharp leaves. On a successful save, the creature instead takes half as much slashing damage.

The fan can also be used as a magic sickle with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
