# Obfuscation Pigments
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This pot contains enough paint to cover up to 10 square feet of surface area. Any object completely covered by this paint becomes covered in a unique enchantment that makes it elusive and difficult to recognise for the next hour.

Although the object remains the same visually, it becomes psychologically blocked out by any creature that is not already aware of its presence. For example, even if this dagger was seen by random strangers on the street, they would not cognitively recognise it and would most likely ignore it unless forced to interact with it.

Any attempt to find an item covered in this paint by someone actively searching for it is rolled at disadvantage. However, a creature that touches an item covered in this paint, or who is verbally informed of its presence, ceases to be influenced by this paint's ability.
