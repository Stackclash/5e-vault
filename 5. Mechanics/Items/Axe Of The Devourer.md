# Axe of the Devourer
*Generic Variant, very rare (requires attunement)*  


Whenever you deal a lethal blow to a creature with this weapon, your maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to the amount of hit points that creature had remaining just before you killed it. This increase remains until the end of your next long rest.

## Curse:

The lingering hunger of this weapon compels you to not wield anything else, forcing you to only use this weapon when making weapon attacks against other creatures. Any time that you increase your hit point maximum beyond double its original amount using the ability of this weapon, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you are wracked with extreme hunger, suffering 1 point of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] until you consume at least 5 pounds of food.
