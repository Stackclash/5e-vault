This bow is made of pure ice, which only becomes pliable in your hands once you attune to it. While the bow is on your person, your skin becomes covered in a thin layer of protective frost, granting you a +1 bonus to AC and immunity to cold damage.

An arrow that's fired from the bow becomes covered in ice, which deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) cold damage to any target it hits. If you hit a target within 5 feet of you using the bow on your turn, the target also has disadvantage on any attack rolls it makes until the end of your current turn.

The bow has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to use either of the following properties.

## Hailstorm Volley

For each charge you expend, you fire a magical arrow of pure ice from the bow into the sky centered directly above a point that you can see within 120 feet of you. Sharp hail then falls from the sky in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on the point. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) cold damage, plus `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) cold damage for each expended charge after the first. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage. The hailstones then turn the area into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

## Ice Wall

For each charge you expend, you fire a magical arrow of pure ice from the bow at a different point on the ground that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each arrow then grows into a 10-foot-square panel that's 1 foot thick and perpendicular to the ground. Each panel has AC 12, 30 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side) and must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each panel remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points.
