# Crown of Season's Embrace
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement by an elf, half-elf, or fey)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Crown-of-Seasons-Embrace.webp#right)  


This silver crown of tangled branches is dotted with tiny jewels, with a larger diamond resting at its center. While wearing the crown, you can change the shape of your ears using a bonus action. You also gain the elf's Trance racial trait if you don't already have it.

The crown has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn.

## Spells

While wearing the crown, you can use an action to expend 4 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dimension Door.md\|dimension door]] spell; alternatively, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Misty Step.md\|misty step]] spell from it.

## Season Change

When you first attune to the crown, and then again daily at dawn, you can choose a season for the crown to resonate with. When you do, the gemstones on the crown change color to match the respective season, and you gain resistance to the damage type associated with it. You can use a bonus action to expend 3 of the crown's charges to immediately change the associated season. Use the table below to determine what color and damage type is associated with each season.

| Season | Color | Damage Type |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Winter | Blue | Cold |
| Spring | Green | Radiant |
| Summer | Gold | Fire |
| Autumn | Orange | Necrotic |
