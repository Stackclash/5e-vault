# Prism Lantern
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Prism-Lantern.webp#right)  


This lantern has a triangular hatch and lens for its light to shine through. A small, clear prism floats at its center. While holding the lantern, you can use a bonus action to cause the prism to glow, shedding bright light in a 30-foot cone and dim light for an additional 30 feet from the lantern. You choose the light's color, using the table below. It remains lit for 1 hour or until you use a bonus action to end the effect. You can change the light's color using a bonus action.

If the lantern is shedding this cone of light, you can use an action while holding the lantern to point it in a single direction and speak its command word. Until the start of your next turn or until the lantern is moved (whichever comes first), whenever a creature that's within the lantern's bright light takes damage of a type associated with the light's color, that damage is reduced by `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`), or half as much if the creature is in the lantern's dim light. Once the lantern has prevented 50 damage in this way, starting with the creature closest to the lantern each time, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
