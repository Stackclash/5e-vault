# Life Tether Ankh
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Life-Tether-Ankh.webp#right)  


While wearing this necklace, you can choose to succeed on a death saving throw you would have otherwise failed (no action required). Once the ankh has been used to succeed on a death saving throw, it shatters and is destroyed.

If you use the ankh when you would normally suffer two failed death saving throws, you instead gain one success and one failure. If this would cause you to have 3 successful death saving throws as well as 3 failed ones, roll a final death saving throw. On a success, you stabilize. On a failure, you die.
