# Amulet of the Closed Heart
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this amulet, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.

In addition, you gain the ability to spend your action to create a pulse of emotionally dampening mental energy in a 30-foot radius around yourself. Any creature in that radius that is under a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charm]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|fear]] condition that would end on a successful saving throw may immediately attempt that saving throw, adding your Intelligence modifier in addition to their normal modifiers.
