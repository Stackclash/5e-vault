# Whalefall Armor
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Half Plate Armor.md\|half plate armor]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Whalefall-Armor.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 15 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

This armor is made of repurposed whale bone and lashed together with salt-stained leather strips. While wearing it, you have resistance to poison damage and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. If you're underwater, you also have advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Animal%20Handling\|Animal Handling]]) or Charisma check you make to interact with beasts that have a swimming speed.

## Charges

The armor has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn.

## Spells

While wearing this armor, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/False Life.md\|false life]] (2nd-level version, 1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Insect Plague.md\|insect plague]] (4 charges; the insects appear as a massive swarm of rotting quippers), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stinking Cloud.md\|stinking cloud]] (2 charges).

## Bakekujira

While wearing the armor, you can use an action to speak its command word and expend any number of charges from the armor, including 0, to summon the spirit of the whale used to make its bone plates. The spirit appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a killer whale, except that it's undead, is immune to poison damage and the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] condition, and has a flying speed equal to its swimming speed. It obeys your mental commands to the best of its ability (no action required by you), and takes its turn immediately after yours. If you don't issue any commands, the spirit defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The spirit disappears in a cloud of marine snow after 1 minute. It disappears early if you use an action to dismiss it or if it's reduced to 0 hit points.

When the spirit disappears, roll a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`). If the result is equal to or less than 5 + the number of charges you expended as part of the action to summon it, it disappears as normal, and the property can't be used again until the next dawn. If the result is higher than that number, the spirit becomes hostile to you; it remains for 1 additional minute, can't be dismissed, and immediately regains half its maximum number of hit points. When this happens, this property of the armor can't be used again until `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) days have passed, during which time the number of charges the armor regains each day is reduced by half (rounded up).
