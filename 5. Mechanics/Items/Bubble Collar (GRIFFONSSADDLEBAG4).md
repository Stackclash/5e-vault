# Bubble Collar
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Bubble-Collar.webp#right)  


This metal collar magically resizes to fit snugly around your neck. You can wear or remove the collar using an action. While wearing the collar, a large bubble magically forms around your head whenever you're submerged in water. The bubble provides enough breathable air for 10 minutes. For the duration, you can speak normally while underwater, although your voice is still muffled by the surrounding water. At the end of that time, the bubble pops; the bubble pops early if you take any damage, if you are no longer submerged, or if you remove the collar. Once it pops, the bubble won't appear again until the collar spends at least 1 minute out of the water.
