# Dream Saber
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Scimitar.md\|scimitar]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Dream-Saber.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and any creature it hits takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) psychic damage. When the damage you deal with this weapon would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to magically cause it to fall asleep, instead of dealing the damage. The sleeping creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for 10 minutes or until it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. When you cause a creature to fall asleep in this way, you can also force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you immediately learn its surface thoughts and can decide what dreams it has while asleep. Once a creature falls asleep in this way, it is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
