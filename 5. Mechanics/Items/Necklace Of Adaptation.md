# Necklace of Adaptation
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/necklace-of-adaptation.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cloudkill.md\|cloudkill]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stinking Cloud.md\|stinking cloud]] effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
