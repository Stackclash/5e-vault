# Ring of the Candle Collector
*Ring, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Ring-of-the-Candle-Collector.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you can use an action to snap your fingers on the hand that's wearing it. When you do, choose one nonmagical light of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you; if the light is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, it winks out. A miniscule, harmless flame then magically appears above the ring. The flame emits candlelight. You can use a free hand as a bonus action to either snuff out the flame, reducing its light to that of a glimmering ember, or cradle it to return it to candlelight. While the ring has a flame, you can use another action to magically light an unlit object, such as a torch, lamp, or candle, that you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, the ring's flame vanishes. The ring can only have one flame above it at a time.
