# Rod of Resurrection
*Rod, major, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/rod-of-resurrection.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/He(AL).md\|heal]] (expends 1 charge) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Resurrection.md\|resurrection]] (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of radiance.
