# Hammer of Whispers
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Light Hammer.md\|light hammer]]), cursed item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Hammer-of-Whispers.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 bludgeoning
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This dark silver hammer is miraculously light. It has the finesse property, and any target hit with it takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) psychic damage. Hitting a target with the hammer produces no sound.

## Curse

This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the hammer, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your mind is plagued with mysterious whispers; you take `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage and are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] until the end of your next turn.
