# Amulet of the Desert Tyrant
*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This item has 9 charges. While wearing this amulet you may spend an action and 1 or more charges to do any of the following:

- You may use the item to cast any of the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spiritual Weapon.md\|spiritual weapon]] (2 charges, plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 2nd), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animate Dead.md\|animate dead]] (3 charges plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 3rd), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Guardian Of Faith.md\|guardian of faith]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Insect Plague.md\|insect plague]] (5 charges, plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 5th), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Harm.md\|harm]] (6 charges).  
- You create a cloud of blinding dust and sand around yourself. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] until the end of their next turn (2 charges).  
- You transform yourself into a whirlwind of sand and immediately move up to 60 feet and then revert to normal form. While in whirlwind form, you are immune to all damage, and you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#grappled\|grappled]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#petrified\|petrified]], knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]]. Equipment worn or carried by you remain in your possession (2 charges).  

If you die while wearing this amulet, and if this amulet has at least 7 charges in it, the amulet will automatically expend 7 charges to create a new body for your soul to inhabit. This body is formed from dust in a space within 5 feet of the amulet over the course of 24 hours, upon which the amulet can be placed on the new body, allowing your soul to enter it and return to life. This new body is a duplicate of your original one at the moment of its death but with all wounds healed and all hit points restored. This ability fails if the amulet is destroyed or removed from your body during the 24 hours it is creating a new body.

This item regains `dice: 1d8 + 1|avg` (`1d8 + 1`) charges daily at dawn.
