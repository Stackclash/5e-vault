- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This classic farmer's heirloom depicts wheat and field designs. When you hit a plant creature with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) slashing damage. In addition, any nonmagical plant harvested with this sickle magically remains fresh for an extra 7 days.
