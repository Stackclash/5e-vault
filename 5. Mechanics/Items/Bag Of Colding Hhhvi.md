# Bag of Colding
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This bag has a permanent enchantment on it that causes any organic material inside it to be kept in a state of preservation as if it had the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gentle Repose.md\|gentle repose]] cast upon it. This effect wears off as soon as the item is removed from the bag, and the bag must be completely closed in order for its ability to function.

The bag is capable of holding up to 3 cubic feet of material inside it and its opening can open up to 1 foot in diameter.
