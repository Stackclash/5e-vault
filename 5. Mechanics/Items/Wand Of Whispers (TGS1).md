# Wand of Whispers
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Wand-of-Whispers.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

These wands are sometimes found in the hands of clandestine mages posing as simple townsfolk. Its magic wax and iron design resembles a candle and candlestick. The wand produces a harmless, magical flame that is indistinguishable from normal candlelight, although the wax never melts or changes shape. The flame is harmless and casts bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for another 5 feet. While holding the wand, you can extinguish or relight the flame as a bonus action.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Message.md\|message]] (no charges) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sending.md\|sending]] spell (3 charges) from it. Alternatively, when you cast a spell of 5th level or lower while holding the wand, you can expend 1 of the wand's charges per spell slot level to ignore the spell's verbal components. Any spell that requires a target to hear its verbal component gains no benefit from this property.

The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the magical flame burns out and the wand becomes a mundane candle and candlestick.
