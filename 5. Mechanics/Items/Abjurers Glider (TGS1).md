# Abjurer's Glider
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Abjurers-Glider.webp#right)  


This golden badge is usually given to wizards who either excel at or who have mastered abjuration magic as a symbol of their accomplishments. While wearing this badge, you always have the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shield.md\|shield]] spell prepared if you know it, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared. In addition, whenever you cast the *shield* spell, you can take another reaction before the start of your next turn. This second reaction can't be used to cast the *shield* spell again.
