# Poltergeist Candle Holder
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Poltergeist-Candle-Holder.webp#right)  


This pewter candle holder makes your hand feel slightly numb while holding it. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to cause the candle holder to magically hover just above your shoulder. The holder floats back to the ground if anything other than a candle is placed on it. In addition, any candle in the holder releases a thin wisp of smoke while lit. The smoke hangs motionless in the air, regardless of wind, and dissipates after 6 seconds.
