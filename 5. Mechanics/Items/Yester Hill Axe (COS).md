# Yester Hill Axe
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Battleaxe.md\|battleaxe]])*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The axe's handle is carved with leaves and vines, and it weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.
