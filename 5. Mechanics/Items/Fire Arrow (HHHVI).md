# Fire Arrow
*Ammunition ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Arrow.md\|arrow]]), uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 fire
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]
- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

These arrows combust upon direct piercing organic material. When you hit a target successfully with this arrow, you deal an additional `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage. These arrows lose this property on hit and become regular arrows afterwards.
