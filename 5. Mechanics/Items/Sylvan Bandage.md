# Sylvan Bandage
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

An ubiquitous, blood-red moss that is found growing on the shaded sides of trees. The many survival adaptations developed by this moss also make it incredibly useful when applied as a healing poultice; its water retention methods act as an anticoagulant, its anti-parasitic coating acts as an antiseptic, and its sponginess is just generally useful when applied as a bandage (thus its common name).

## Effect:

When you use this herb during a short rest, you regain any number of hit die you spent to recover hit points during that rest.
