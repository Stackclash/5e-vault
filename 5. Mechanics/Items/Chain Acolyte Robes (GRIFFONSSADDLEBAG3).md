# Chain Acolyte Robes
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Chain Mail.md\|chain mail]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Chain-Acolyte-Robes.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 16
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 55.0 lbs.

These acolyte robes are draped in heavy chain mail. You are proficient with this armor and ignore its Strength requirement if you have a spellcasting ability score of at least 13.

## Spells

While wearing the armor, you can use an action to cast either the hold monster or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Person.md\|hold person]] spell from the armor, using your spell save DC. When you do, the spell holds the target in place with magical chains; for the spell's duration, the target takes `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage from the chains at the start of each of its turns. Once you cast a spell in this way, that spell can't be cast from the armor again until the next dawn.

## Wand of Binding

If you are also attuned to a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of Binding.md\|wand of binding]], it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. In addition, whenever you use the wand to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Monster.md\|hold monster]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Person.md\|hold person]], you can choose to have it cast the armor's version of the spell instead. You still use the wand's save DC when casting the spell in this way.
