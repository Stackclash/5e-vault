This maul's stone head is carved from fallen moon rock. A howling wolf and pockmarked moon are carved into the weapon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, or a +2 bonus if it's between dusk and dawn. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target of the attack must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of your next turn. The target has disadvantage on the saving throw if it can see the moon or if it's cursed with lycanthropy. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] creature immediately falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] as it recoils.
