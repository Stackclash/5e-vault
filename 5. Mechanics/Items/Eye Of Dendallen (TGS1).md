# Eye of Dendallen
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Eye-of-Dendallen.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

While you're attuned to this item, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/See Invisibility.md\|see invisibility]] spell at will.

## Curse

When you attune to the eye of Dendallen, you're suddenly overcome with the urge to see what it sees. Make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you resist the curse and are aware of its effects but are no longer attuned to the item. On a failure, you forcefully tear out one of your own eyes, taking `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) necrotic damage, and allow the eye of Dendallen to crawl into its now vacant socket. If you're already missing an eye, you simply let the eye crawl into the socket without taking the necrotic damage.

You can see normally through the eye of Dendallen while it's in your socket. In addition, you have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. If you already had darkvision, the eye increases its range by 30 feet. As a bonus action, you can concentrate on looking through the eye to peer through magical darkness in this way for 1 minute. Once this property of the eye has been used, it can't be used again until the following dusk.

## Dendallen Familiar

The eye also doubles as a gruesome familiar. As an action, you can command the eye to crawl out of your eye socket and move independently of you. Use the abilities described in the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell when commanding the eye of Dendallen. The eye is undead, has 5 hit points, an AC of 12, a walking and climbing speed of 20 feet, does not require air to breathe, has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, and has a +6 bonus to Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks. If the eye is slain or you dismiss it, it reappears inside your open eye socket with a sickly sound. The eyeball appears pitch black if it's slain and loses this feature as well as its benefits to your vision until the following dusk.

Unattuning to the eye or targeting it with the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell causes it to pull itself out of the socket and try to escape. Slaying the eye while it is unattuned to a creature destroys the item.
