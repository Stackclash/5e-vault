# Helm of Transmission
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This helmet is paired with another helmet made from the other head of the ettin from which this helmet was crafted. While wearing this helmet, you are magically linked with any creature that is also wearing and attuned to the paired helmet, so long as both of you are on the same plane of existence. While linked in this way, you may communicate with that creature telepathically at any distance, and if you receive damage, you may spend your reaction to transfer any amount of that damage to the linked creature.
