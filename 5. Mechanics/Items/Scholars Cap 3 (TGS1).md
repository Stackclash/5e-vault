# Scholar's Cap +3
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Scholars-Cap.webp#right)  


This hat carries with it the cleverness and knowledge of many previous scholars. While wearing the hat, you gain a +3 bonus to Intelligence checks and saving throws.

In addition, when it would normally take you at least 1 week in order to research a subject, you instead finish that research 3 days faster for each week you would have spent.
