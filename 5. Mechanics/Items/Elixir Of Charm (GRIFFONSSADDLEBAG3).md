# Elixir of Charm
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


FOR [HEDGE MAGE](compendium/classes/wizard-hedge-mage-griffonssaddlebag3.md#Hedge%20Mage%20(Level%202)) USE ONLY

Ingredients: A rose petal, a piece of parchment with a romantic message, and a hair from a humanoid.

Command: The full name of the humanoid whose hair was used.

This potion is made with the freshly plucked hair of a humanoid. If another creature drinks this potion, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by the humanoid whose hair was used in the potion for 1 hour. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], the creature regards this humanoid as a friendly acquaintance. The charm ends early if the creature takes any damage. On a successful save, the creature is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] and is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
