# Eyes of Charming
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/eyes-of-charming.webp#right]]  


These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Person.md\|charm person]] spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
