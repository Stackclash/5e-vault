# Rod of Endless Light
*Rod, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Rod-of-Endless-Light.webp#right)  


While holding this rod, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do, the rod sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light remains for 1 hour or until you use an action speak the rod's command word again while holding it. For the duration, you can use a bonus action to mentally change the color of the light while holding the rod.
