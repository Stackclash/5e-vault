While holding this rod, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do, the rod sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light remains for 1 hour or until you use an action speak the rod's command word again while holding it. For the duration, you can use a bonus action to mentally change the color of the light while holding the rod.
