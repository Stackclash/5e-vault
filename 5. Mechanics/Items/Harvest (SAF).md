# Harvest
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Sickle.md\|sickle]]), very rare (requires attunement by an evil creature)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/harvest.jpg#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

If you are a neutral character, this reaping tool functions as a normal weapon with no bonus or special properties. If you are good, touching Harvest deals `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage to you. If you are an evil character, you can use this sickle as a magic weapon with the following properties.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus increases to +3 against good creatures. If you reduce a living, mortal creature to 0 hit points, you regain `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) hit points.

Whenever you score a critical hit, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) on the Undead row of the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Servitors (SAF).md\|Servitors]] chart (page 31). A bell tolls and the rolled servitors burst from the ground. These undead fight for you and obey your commands. The undead turn to dust after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points.
