# Amulet of the Platinum Fang
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Amulet-of-the-Platinum-Fang.webp#right)  


A single fang said to be from a deific dragon hangs on this platinum necklace. The tooth itself is cracked but repaired with molten platinum, sealing it together and retaining its inherent magic. You have resistance to radiant damage while wearing this amulet. In addition, whenever a spell restores hit points to you, you also gain `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) temporary hit points.

## Platinum Aspect

While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to call forth an instantaneous, spectral maw of a platinum dragon. Make a melee spell attack with the maw against a target within 15 feet of you, using a +10 spell attack bonus. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d10+10|noform|avg` (`2d10 + 10`) force damage plus `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) radiant damage. Once you've used this property, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

If you're a dragonborn, you can choose to use this property in place of your breath weapon. When you do, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest, instead of the next dawn. If you use your normal breath weapon, you can choose for it to deal radiant damage, instead of its normal damage type.
