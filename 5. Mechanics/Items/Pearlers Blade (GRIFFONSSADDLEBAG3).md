This peculiar blade is made with a clamped-together pair of sharpened oyster shells. Its handle has been patinaed from use near the water over time and has a pearlized, wave-like design just above its wooden grip. A single pearl is implanted within the blade and always has a watery sheen.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If the dagger is left to rest in water for 8 consecutive hours, there is a chance that the blade opens up at the end of that time to reveal a single white pearl worth 100 gp. The percent chance to open is equal to 10 times the highest challenge rating of any creature slain with the dagger since it was last left to rest in the water, up to a maximum of 50 percent. The blade closes again once the pearl is removed.
