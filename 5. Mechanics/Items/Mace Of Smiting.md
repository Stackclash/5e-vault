# Mace of Smiting
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]]), major, rare*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/mace-of-smiting.webp#right]]  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 14 bludgeoning damage if it's a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.

> [!note]
> Note: According to the SRD, it is an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) and `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage, although this is incorrect (https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/174522/53884).
