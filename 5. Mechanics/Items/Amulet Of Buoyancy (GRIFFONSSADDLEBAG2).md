This well-worn necklace is adorned with the bow of a ship and a crashing wave of blue glass. While wearing this amulet, you can use your reaction to immediately stand up when you're knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. When you do, your speed is halved until the end of your next turn. In addition, if you start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, you immediately rise 60 feet toward the surface.
