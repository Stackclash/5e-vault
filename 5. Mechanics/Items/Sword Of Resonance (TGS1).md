# Sword of Resonance
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Longsword.md\|longsword]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Sword-of-Resonance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This peculiar brass longsword is hollow and has lute strings that run along its blade, allowing you to use this sword as both a lute and spellcasting focus. You're proficient with this lute while you're attuned to the sword. This sword also has the finesse property due to the hollow blade's reduced weight.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the sword's hollow metal blade magically amplifies the music made when using it to inspire allies. Whenever you expend a use of your [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)), the sword begins to reverberate with thunderous energy. The next time you hit a target before the end of your next turn with an attack using the sword, that target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) thunder damage from the attack.
