# Bloodscryer Oculus
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement by a ranger)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bloodscryer-Oculus.webp#right)  


These red goggles have a second set of lenses that magically adjust their distance from your eyes to magnify and focus on targets. While you're attuned to these goggles, you are unaffected by visual obscurity such as fog or smoke and can see up to 60 feet in magical and nonmagical darkness. If you already have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]], wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet. Additionally, you gain advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

These lenses are also imbued with several innate spells. While wearing the goggles, you can cast the following spells from them, using your spell save DC, but can only target creatures whose blood you can see: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hunters Mark.md\|hunter's mark]] (3rd-level version), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Locate Creature.md\|locate creature]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]]. Casting a spell in this way does not require you to concentrate on the spell in order to maintain it. Once the oculus casts a spell in this way, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
