# Mandible Bident
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Trident.md\|trident]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mandible-Bident.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 P
  - Two-handed: 1d8 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This chitinous, two-pronged weapon still shudders with predatory instinct, magically biting down on creatures it hits. Once on each of your turns when you hit a Medium or smaller creature with this magic bident with a melee attack, you can force that creature to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by you and is held in place by the weapon. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from this grapple on a success. You can't use the weapon to attack another target while it's grappling a creature in this way, but you can choose to deal `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] creature automatically in place of any attack you'd make with it as part of the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, as the weapon's pincers clamp down tightly around the target.

You can release a creature from the bident's grapple on your turn (no action required). The weapon releases a creature from its grasp early if you let go of the weapon or are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]].
