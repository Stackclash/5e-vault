# Dimensional Quiver
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Dimensional-Quiver.webp#right)  


This purple glass quiver is open on both ends and doesn't have a strap. While attuned to it, the quiver floats comfortably within your reach whenever you place it against your body. While attuned to the quiver, you're immune to the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Banishment.md\|banishment]] spell and similar magic that would transport you to another plane of existence against your will.

The quiver also functions as an efficient quiver. The first time you hit a target on each of your turns using a piece of ammunition or a weapon drawn from the quiver, that target takes an extra `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) force damage from the attack.

In addition, you can use an action to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blink.md\|blink]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dimension Door.md\|dimension door]] spell from the quiver while it's on your person. When you cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blink.md\|blink]] in this way, you can see up to 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane and can attack targets there as if they were on your current plane of existence for the duration. Once the quiver has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
