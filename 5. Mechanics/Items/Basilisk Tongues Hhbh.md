# Basilisk Tongues
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A plant with drooping purple-grey flowers, resembling those of a basilisk's tongue. Indeed, the resemblance is more than superficial, as the petals secrete a magical oil that can transform flesh into stone much like its namesake's gaze. It has long been debated as to whether this is a mere coincidence, or if perhaps the basilisk gained its signature ability through a long coexistence with the plant. Unfortunately, no conclusive evidence has so far been found.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition, covering it in a petrifying oil for 10 minutes. A creature hit by this weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or gain one level of the following effects as they begin to turn to stone. The affected creature's movement speed is halved. The affected creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]]. The affected creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#petrified\|petrified]] as it turns to stone. The creature may make the Constitution saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, reducing their effect level by one on a success. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell or similar magic cast on an affected creature instantly removes all levels.
