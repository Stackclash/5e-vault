# Herbalist's Journal
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Herbalists-Journal.webp#right)  


This old, leather-bound book is caked in dirt. Inside is an almost unreadable scrawl of words, written in Common, that go into remarkable depth about herbology.

If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you gain proficiency with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Herbalism Kit.md\|herbalism kit]]. If you were already proficient with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Herbalism Kit.md\|herbalism kit]], you instead gain the feature below. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in 10 years if it's buried in soil for the duration.

## Enhance Potion

You can spend 25 gp of materials a collection of rare herbs and roots to enhance a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing.md\|potion of healing]]. Doing so requires 1 hour of work using an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Herbalism Kit.md\|herbalism kit]], which can be done over the course of a short rest. At the end of the hour, the potion's color changes to a shimmering green. It remains this color for 7 days; for the duration, a creature that drinks the potion uses d6s, instead of d4s, when determining the number of hit points the potion restores.

This feature can also be used to enhance a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Greater Healing.md\|potion of greater healing]] (50 gp of materials), a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Superior Healing.md\|potion of superior healing]] (75 gp), or a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Supreme Healing.md\|potion of supreme healing]] (100 gp).
