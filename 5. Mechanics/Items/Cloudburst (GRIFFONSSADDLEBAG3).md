# Cloudburst
*Major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Cloudburst.webp#right)  


This magic bow is weightless to hold. The shapes of its extending arms change ever so slightly while held, but always resemble a pair of stylized clouds, and a faint mist wraps around it. The normal range of cloudburst is 30 feet more than a typical bow of its type.

Whenever you use this bow to fire an arrow into water vapor, such as into a low-lying mist or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]] spell, the vapor immediately disappears from the area in a 10-foot-wide line, following the arrow's trajectory; fog can't reenter that space until the end of your next turn. Air elementals and other creatures made of clouds or mist take an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) force damage from ranged attacks using the bow.
