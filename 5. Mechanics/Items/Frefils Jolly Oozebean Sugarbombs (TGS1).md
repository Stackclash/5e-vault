# Frefil's Jolly Oozebean Sugarbombs
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Frefils-Jolly-Oozebean-Sugarbombs.webp#right)  


A pack of oozebeans comes with 4 inside it. When you open a pack, roll `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) and record each number. Use these numbers to determine the kinds of oozebeans found in the bag using the table below. You can eat an oozebean using a bonus action. Each color has an effect that lasts for 1 minute.

## Upset Stomach

You can only be under the effects of 1 sugarbomb that has this feature at a time. Eating a sugarbomb that has this feature while under the effects of another one causes the effects of the first sugarbomb to immediately end and be replaced by the new one's. This rapid change is difficult to stomach, forcing you to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain the effects of the new sugarbomb, but become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. On a success, you gain the effects of the new sugarbomb and are not poisoned.
