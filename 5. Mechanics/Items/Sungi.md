# Sungi
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

There are some green adventurers that tell tales of times when they discovered a cave filled with phosphorescent mushrooms and the ghostly beauty they inspire; such stories are nothing when compared to the dazzling radiance of the sungi. A subterranean mushroom that contains a magical light rivalling that of the sun, this incredibly bright fungus is almost like an oasis in the suffocating darkness of a deep cave. The luminescence of the sungi is so bright, that clusters of them are capable of creating miniature ecosystems by themselves, surrounded by insects that resemble those on the surface, rather than specimens normally found in subterranean systems.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A weapon that has had this herb applied to it is considered magical and deals an additional `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`) radiant damage upon its first successful hit in a turn. This effect lasts for one hour.
