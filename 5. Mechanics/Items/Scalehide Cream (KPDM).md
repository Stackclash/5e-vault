# Scalehide Cream
*Wondrous item, rare*  


As an action, you can rub this dull green cream over your skin. When you do, you sprout thick, olive-green scales like those of a giant lizard or green dragon that last for 1 hour. These scales give you a natural AC of 15 + your Constitution modifier. This natural AC doesn't combine with any worn armor or with a Dexterity bonus to AC.

A *jar of scalehide cream* contains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) doses.
