# Fool's Charm
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

A succulent related to the jade plant, easily identified by the golden tinge it has on each of its plump leaves. Exceedingly rare, this auspicious plant has been found in many culture's folktales, as either a lucky boon that saves the hero from danger, or as a reward from a trickster god for a job well done. These legends are well earned, as the plant does have some form of magic that bends fate to its owner's good fortune, wilting away the more it protects them from harm.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d8+4|avg` (`1d8+4`) charges, with each charge representing one of the remaining leaves on this herb's stem. Any time you roll a 1 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw while holding this herb, you may expend a charge in order to reroll that dice and use the new result. Once all charges have been used on this herb, it withers away and becomes useless.
