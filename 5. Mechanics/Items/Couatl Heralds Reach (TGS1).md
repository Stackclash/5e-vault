# Couatl Herald's Reach
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Couatl-Heralds-Reach.webp#right)  


This wooden bow is carved to resemble a mighty [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Couatl.md\|couatl]]. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bow has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack against a Large or smaller creature with the bow, you can choose a limb to target and expend 1 of the bow's charges as part of the attack. If the attack hits, the weapon's damage becomes radiant, and the creature is forced to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, that creature's targeted limb is pinned by radiant tethers of magic: holding it to its body or an adjacent surface (if any) for up to 1 minute.

Depending on the pinned limb, the creature may fall over [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]], be unable to move, or make weapon attacks with disadvantage while the limb remains pinned in this way. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success from the pinning tethers.

## Flight of the Couatls

While you're attuned to 3 items with this property, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, your flying speed increases by 30 feet instead.
