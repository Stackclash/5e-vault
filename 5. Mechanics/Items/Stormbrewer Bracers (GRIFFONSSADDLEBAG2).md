# Stormbrewer Bracers
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Stormbrewer-Bracers.webp#right)  


This pair of electrum bracers are always covered in a thin layer of condensation. When you roll initiative while wearing the bracers, they begin to billow out wafting clouds around your wrists. The clouds surrounding your wrists grow darker with every charge the bracers have, becoming fierce storm clouds when fully charged. The bracers can hold up to 5 charges, which are lost after 1 minute. The bracers gain 1 charge after you hit a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack while wearing them. If the bracers have 5 charges when you hit a creature in this way, they unleash a burst of electricity and lose all their stored charges, dealing `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) lightning damage to the target of the attack and up to 2 other creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you.

In addition, while wearing the bracers, you can use your reaction when you take lightning damage to reduce that damage by `dice:1d8+4|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 4`) and cause the bracers to gain 1 charge.
