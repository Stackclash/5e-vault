# Wand of Stars
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Warding-Staff.webp#right)  


This antiquated, dark blue wand is adorned with a glowing star at its tip. When it's swung, small specks of starlight drift from its end.

The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand scatters into glittering dust and is destroyed.

## Spells

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15) from it: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Color Spray.md\|color spray]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Daylight.md\|daylight]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hypnotic Pattern.md\|hypnotic pattern]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Light.md\|light]] (no charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Prestidigitation.md\|prestidigitation]] (no charges).

## Starlight Wayfinder

While you can see stars in the sky and are holding the wand, you can use an action to call out a cardinal direction and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, stars in that direction appear brighter to you for 1 hour or until you use the wand again to call out a new direction.
