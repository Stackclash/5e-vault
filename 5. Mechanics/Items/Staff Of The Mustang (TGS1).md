# Staff of the Mustang
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-the-Mustang.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This dark wooden staff is carved in the shape of a majestic stallion. The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Phantom Steed.md\|phantom steed]] spell from it. Alternatively, while holding the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges and speak the staff's command word as a bonus action to take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action.

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff breaks in two as if bitten and is destroyed. When this happens, the sound of hooves can be heard galloping away in an indiscernible direction.
