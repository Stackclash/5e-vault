# Dragon Queen's Cloak
*Wondrous item, cursed item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Dragon-Queens-Cloak.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This cloak is made from the wing of a powerful chromatic dragon. Its attached spaulders are decorated with winged designs and black, blue, green, red, and white gemstones.

While wearing the cloak, you have advantage on any Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) check you make, as the fury of a dragon makes you all the more frightful. In addition, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet.

The cloak has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

## Chromatic Shift

While wearing the cloak, you can expend 1 of its charges using a bonus action to change the cloak to a different color: either black, blue, green, red, or white. You gain resistance to the damage type associated with that color, as shown in the table below. Alternatively, you can use an action to use this property. When you do, you don't need to expend any charges.

## Draconic Breath

While wearing the cloak, you can expend 2 of its charges using an action to exhale a powerful, draconic breath from you. Each creature within the area must make a DC 17 saving throw. A creature takes `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) damage of the breath's type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area of the breath, its damage type, and saving throw are shown in the table below.

## Terrifying Glare

While wearing the cloak, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges when you take damage from a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) psychic damage and becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of its next turn.

|-------|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Black | Acid | 5-foot wide line, 60 feet long | Dexterity |

## Curse

This cloak is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. While you remain cursed, you gain the following flaw: "I am resistant to help and relinquishing control over any task. My way is always the best."
