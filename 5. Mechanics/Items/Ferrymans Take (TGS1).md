# Ferryman's Take
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ferrymans-Take.webp#right)  


These tarnished copper coins are always found in pairs and bear the portrait of a horned man on one side (heads) and a rowboat on the other (tails).

You can place the coins over the eyes of a dead, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]], or willing humanoid creature as an action. When you do, the coins create an effect based on which side is facing up. You can remove one or both of them from the creature's eyes as an action to end their effects early. If the coins aren't facing the same direction, they have no effect on the creature they're placed on.

## Heads

While the coins are heads up over the eyes of an unconscious creature, that creature is stable. If placed over the eyes of a conscious creature, it enters a physical and mental state indistinguishable from death and gains immunity to psychic damage while doing so. The creature remains in that state for 1 hour or until the coins are removed. Once a living creature leaves this state, it can't enter it again in this way for 24 hours.

## Tails

While the coins are tails up over the eyes of a dead creature, that creature is under the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gentle Repose.md\|gentle repose]] spell. Its body can't be detected through magical means, and the soul of the creature can't be contacted.
