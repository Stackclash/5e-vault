# Crown of Celestial Might
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This crown either gleams white if it was crafted from a good-aligned empyrean or is a matte black if it was taken from an evil-aligned empyrean. This crown has 9 charges. While wearing this crown you may spend an action to expend 1 or more charges to do any of the following:

- You cast any of the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fire Storm.md\|fire storm]] (7 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md\|plane shift]] (7 charges, self only), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Earthquake.md\|earthquake]] (8 charges).  
- You strike the ground, triggering an earth tremor. All other creatures on the ground within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] (2 charges).  
- You bolster all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet of you until the end of your next turn. Bolstered creatures can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of your next turn (1 charge).  
- You may make a ranged spell attack at a target within 600 feet. On a successful hit, you deal `dice:7d6|noform|avg` (`7d6`) damage of one of the following types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, or thunder. This ranged attack uses your normal spell attack modifier, or your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus, whichever one is higher (1 charge).  

Additionally, if you fail a saving throw while wearing this crown, you may spend your reaction and 3 charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
