# Horn of the Ancients
*Wondrous Item, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

You may spend your action to blow this horn. If you do, a magical roar is emitted from the horn which can be heard from a distance of 300 feet. Each creature (except the blower of the horn) that can hear the horn is subjected to a certain effect. The effect of the horn changes depending on how many times the horn has been blown that day. Once this horn has been used 3 times in one day, it cannot be blown again for 7 days.

- **First Blow.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#deafened\|deafened]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]] creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 8d10|avg|noform` (`8d10`) thunder damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]]. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]].
