# Chest Burster
*Poison (ingested), rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Poison\|Poison]]

This insidious poison is riddled with tiny slaadi eggs, kept preserved inside the noxious solution that serves as this poison's base. A creature that drinks a dose of this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease-a miniscule slaad egg.

A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Slaad Tadpole.md\|slaad tadpole]]. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.

If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated. This item contains enough poison for 3 doses.
