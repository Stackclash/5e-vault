# Wildfire Ammunition
*Minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wildfire-Ammunition.webp#right)  


This ammunition smolders while you hold it, sparking softly with simmering embers. When you use this arrow or bolt to make a ranged weapon attack, it vanishes in a scattering of sparks immediately after it's fired: disappearing into a special extradimensional space without hitting a target. The ammunition's flames burn hotter the longer it remains in this space and can stay there for up to 3 rounds.

You can use a bonus action on your turn to speak the ammunition's command word and choose a point you can see within 120 feet of where you fired it from. When you do, the arrow or bolt reappears directly above the point and explodes, creating a 20-foot-radius, 40-foothigh cylinder of searing flames centered on that point. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) fire damage, plus an extra `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage for every round the ammunition remained in its pocket dimension. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

If the ammunition remains in its extradimensional space for the full duration without its command word being spoken, it reappears and explodes above a random point within 120 feet of where it was fired.

An arrow or bolt is destroyed when it explodes in this way.
