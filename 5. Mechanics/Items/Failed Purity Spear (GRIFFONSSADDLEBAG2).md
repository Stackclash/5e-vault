The grayed unicorn horn that rests at the top of this sickly spear is fractured and slowly leaks a silver, corrupting fluid. A *failed purity spear* is the rare version of a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Purity Spear (TGS1).md\|purity spear]], a legendary weapon, that was made by a creature other than an elder fey. Its magic is a sad reminder that while unicorns are paragons of good, even their magic can become toxic when mistreated.

## Corruption

This magic spear has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dusk. You can expend 1 charge when you hit a creature with the spear to cause it to inject the target with its corrupting fluid. When you do, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 point of corruption, which last for 1 minute. A creature takes `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns for each point of corruption it has, up to a maximum of `dice:3d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d4`) poison damage. This poison damage ignores resistance and immunity. A creature with at least 1 point of corruption can make another DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it removes 1 point of corruption. A creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] while it has 3 or more points of corruption.

If you expend the spear's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the tip of the spear shatters, and the spear becomes a nonmagical [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]].

## Charge

If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with the spear on the same turn, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) piercing damage.

## Curse

This spear is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the spear, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. While you're cursed, you have disadvantage on any saving throw against poison. However, while you are poisoned, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
