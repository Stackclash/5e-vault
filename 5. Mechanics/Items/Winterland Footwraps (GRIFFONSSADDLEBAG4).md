# Winterland Footwraps
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a monk)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Winterland-Footwraps.webp#right)  


These blue straps keep a soft fur wrap held against your legs. While wearing them, you have resistance to cold damage, and the first time you hit a target with an unarmed strike on each of your turns, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage from the attack. In addition, you can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

When you use your Step of the Wind feature while wearing the wraps, you can walk on water until the end of your turn. When you do, the water beneath your feet magically freezes into a walkable path of floating ice, allowing you to step on it freely. The ice melts after 1 minute.
