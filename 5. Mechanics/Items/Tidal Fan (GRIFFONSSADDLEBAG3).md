# Tidal Fan
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Tidal-Fan.webp#right)  


This water-stained paper fan is sopping wet, although its paper doesn't feel weak from it. When fanning yourself with it, the air is cool and smells of salt.

You can use an action to bat the wet fan downwards, hard, to cause the water to pour out from it into a crashing wave. The wave moves away from you in a line that's 20 feet wide and 60 feet long. Any creature within the line must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and pushed up to 10 feet away from you. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is pushed only 5 feet away from you and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. Any exposed fire within the line is extinguished. The water dissipates immediately afterwards, and the fan becomes magically dry. This property can't be used again until the fan is submerged in water for at least 8 consecutive hours.

You can use an action to bat the dry fan down to create a blast of wind from it in a line that's 10 feet wide and 30 feet long. Each creature within the line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you. Each time you use this property of the fan, there is a cumulative and permanent 10 percent chance that the fan tears apart into nonmagical tatters.
