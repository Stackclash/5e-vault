# Boing Boing Bon Bon
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Boing-Boing-Bon-Bon.webp#right)  


This chocolate candy is filled with a magical, fluffy nougat made of clouds. The candy is delicious, and can be eaten in a single bite using an action. A creature that eats the entire candy gains resistance to bludgeoning damage for the next 10 minutes. For the duration, each time you take bludgeoning damage, you're immediately pushed up to 15 feet away from the damage's source. If the damage is from falling, you bounce 15 feet in the air only once and then land on your feet, taking no further falling damage. The effect ends early if you take any piercing damage, at which point you hear a magical "pop".
