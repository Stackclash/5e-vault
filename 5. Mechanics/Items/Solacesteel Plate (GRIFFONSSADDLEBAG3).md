![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Solacesteel-Plate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This gilded armor is made of purified mourningsteel and repels undead aggression. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on any saving throw against a hostile effect from an undead creature. In addition, you can use a bonus action to touch a creature with 0 hit points. When you do, the creature is stabilized.

If you're a cleric or paladin and are wearing this armor, immediately after an undead creature deals damage to you with a melee attack, it is automatically destroyed if its challenge rating is 1 or lower.
