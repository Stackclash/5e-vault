# Glass Oil
*Oil, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

Spreading this oil on glass causes that glass to become as malleable and flexible as soft rubber. This effect lasts for 1 hour, after which the oil dries and the glass hardens into whatever shape it is currently in. This vial has enough oil to cover 30 square feet of glass.
