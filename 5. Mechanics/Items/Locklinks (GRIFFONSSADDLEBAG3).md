# Locklinks
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Locklinks.webp#right)  


This pair of brass cufflinks look like miniature locks. While wearing them, you can use a bonus action to use one of the following properties:

## Secret Knock

You cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Knock.md\|knock]] spell from the cufflinks with the following changes: the spell has a range of touch, its knock is only audible out to a range of 30 feet, and it has no effect if the target is held shut with arcane lock. The cufflinks lose this property once it's been used for a second time.

## Sleeve's Tools

You flick your wrist to cause a matching set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]] to appear in that hand. The tools disappear again if you are no longer holding them.
