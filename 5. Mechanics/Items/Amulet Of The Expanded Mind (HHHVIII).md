# Amulet of the Expanded Mind
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing and attuned to this amulet, your Intelligence score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. In addition, any attempt to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charm]] you or read your thoughts without your permission fails, and the creature attempting to do so suffers `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) psychic damage.
