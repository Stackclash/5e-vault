# Amulet of the Forest
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This green amulet possesses two sparkling motes of light inside of it. While wearing this amulet, you may spend 1 minute focusing on a living tree within 5 feet of you. If you do so, you gain an innate bond with that tree that lasts for the next 24 hours. This bond grants the tree a low level of sentience, similar to the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Plants.md\|speak with plants]] spell, with the additional bonus that you and the tree may communicate over any distance so long as you are both on the same plane of existence. You may also spend your action to experience what the tree is experiencing until the start of your next turn, during which you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#deafened\|deaf]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blind]] regarding your own senses.

In addition, you may spend 10 minutes focusing on a square patch of soil that is 5 feet on each side. At the end of that 10 minutes, a tree magically grows from that patch of soil. The tree has a diameter of 5 feet and grows until it is 20 feet tall or reaches a solid object above it, whichever comes first. You automatically have an innate bond with this tree, and it disappears automatically 24 hours after it has been created. You may only have one of these trees at a time, attempting to create a new one while another already exists causes the earlier one to disappear early.
