# Blubber Bulb
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 10 gp

## Description:

A low-growing flower with yellow-grey petals that can be found in even the most frigid of environments. It owes its survival to the thick blubber-like oil that it builds up inside its flower bulb that insulates it from biting winds and freezing colds. Not only is this blubber effective at protecting the plant, but it is also able to protect the skin from minor damage that an adventurer may encounter in the wild.

## Effect:

After using this herb, you are covered in a thick layer of blubber-like oil that remains for 4 hours. During this time, you are immune to any cold, fire, poison, or acid damage that you would suffer as a result of touching a target or from hitting them with a melee weapon attack.
