This magic, twisting blowgun channels the air around it to create powerful blasts of wind. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from you. Attacking at long range with this weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with it.

The blowgun has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 of its charges to blow through the weapon to create a line of wind 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Any Medium or smaller creature in the line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you.
