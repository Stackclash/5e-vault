# Cloak of the Arachnid
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This long cloak has undergone a unique tanning process that utilized the magical bile from the magical transformation gland of a drow priestess. While wearing this cloak, you may use your action to speak its command word to meld it to you, causing eight spider legs to grow from your back. These spider legs are capable of growing through clothes and armor without damaging them.

Each of these legs has a reach roughly equal to the length of one of your legs, and while they are present, you may use them as basic appendages that you are naturally coordinated in using. As part of this, you may use them for the following abilities:

- You have a climb speed equal to your movement speed and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. In addition, because your spider legs do the climbing for you, you retain use of both of your normal hands even while climbing.  
- You ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing and you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Web.md\|web]] spell at will.  
- You may use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike with your spider legs at a target adjacent to you. This attack deals `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) + your Strength modifier in slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.  

These spider legs last for 1 hour or until you cancel them early by speaking the command word again, after which they recede into your back and your cloak reappears. Once used once, this item may not be used again until the next dawn.
