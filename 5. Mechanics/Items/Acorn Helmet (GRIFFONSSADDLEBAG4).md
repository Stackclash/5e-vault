# Acorn Helmet
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Acorn-Helmet.webp#right)  


While wearing this helmet, any falling damage you take is reduced by half. Furthermore, any damage you take as a result of something falling on you, such as a boulder or ambushing darkmantle, is also halved.

In addition, you have advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Animal%20Handling\|Animal Handling]]) or Charisma check you make to interact with Tiny woodland beasts while wearing the helmet.
