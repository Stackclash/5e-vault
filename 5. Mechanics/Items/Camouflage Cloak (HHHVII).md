# Camouflage Cloak
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

You may cover yourself with this cloak as a free action while pressing yourself flat against a hard, uniformly colored surface. If you do so, your cloak changes to match the color of the surface you are pressed against, giving you advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks you make while remaining motionless against this surface.
