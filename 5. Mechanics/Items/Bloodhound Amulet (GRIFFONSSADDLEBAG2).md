While wearing this pendant, you have advantage on any ability check that relies on smell. In addition, you can use an action to focus on a particular scent. When you do, you perceive that smell visually as a cloud of red vapor for up to 1 hour. Once this property of the amulet has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
