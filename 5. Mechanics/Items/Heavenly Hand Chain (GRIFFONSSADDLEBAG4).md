# Heavenly Hand Chain
*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Heavenly-Hand-Chain.webp#right)  


This platinum ring is chained to a matching bracelet. While wearing the hand chain, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Warding Bond.md\|warding bond]] spell on another creature you touch. This version of the spell lasts for 1 minute, instead of 1 hour, or until the target is more than 60 feet away from you. For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action to pull the affected creature to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of you (provided it's willing). Once a creature has been affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Warding Bond.md\|warding bond]] spell in this way, it can't be targeted by the spell using the hand chain again until the next dawn.
