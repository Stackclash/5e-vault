- **Damage**: 2d6 S

- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

At the center of this brilliant, silver sword is a deep groove which leads down to an open gap in its hilt. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you harness the healing power of your Lay on Hands while holding the weapon, a glimmering sphere of holy light radiates from the center of the blade.

While holding this weapon, whenever you spend hit points from your Lay on Hands pool to heal another creature, you also regain `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) hit points for every 10 hit points you restore to the other creature. When you slay a creature with a challenge rating of 5 or higher using this sword, your Lay on Hands pool regains a number of hit points equal to twice the creature's challenge rating.

You can also use the hit points from your Lay on Hands pool in the following ways while holding the blade.

## Rebuke Healing

When another creature that you can see within your aura magically regains hit points, you can use your reaction to spend any number of hit points from your Lay on Hands pool. The amount of hit points restored to the creature is reduced by that amount.

## Summon Preserver

You can use an action to spend 40 hit points from your Lay on Hands pool to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Guardian Of Faith.md\|guardian of faith]] spell, which has the following changes. Whenever a friendly creature enters a space within 10 feet of the guardian or starts its turn there, it can choose to gain up to 20 temporary hit points. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of this effect increases to 30 feet. When the combined number of hit points granted as temporary hit points or dealt as radiant damage reaches 60, the guardian vanishes.
