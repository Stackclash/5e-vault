# Breastplate of the Morning Light
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Breastplate.md\|breastplate]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Breastplate-of-the-Morning-Light.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

You have a +1 bonus to your AC. You can use an action on your turn to channel the armor's magic to cause it to emit a flash of blinding, radiant light. When you do, all other creatures within 30 feet of you are forced to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the end of its next turn. Undead creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw and take `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) radiant damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
