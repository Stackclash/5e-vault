# Djinn and Tonic (Common)
*Potion, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Djinn-and-Tonic.webp#right)  


The typical [[5. Mechanics/Items/Djinn And Tonic (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|djinn and tonic]], a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes a magical wind to tussle your hair, cloak, or other clothing dramatically for 1 hour after you drink it. A small mote of mist dances above the potion's liquid and gently stirs it. The beverage is smooth, bubbly, and very refreshing with notes of juniper, elderberries, white peach, and lavender. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
