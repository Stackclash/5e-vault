# Bulette Bulwark
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bulette-Bulwark.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This leather-wrapped shield was made from the armored body of a bulette and still retains some of its natural properties. While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

In addition, the shield has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the shield, you can use a bonus action to speak the shield's command word and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, you gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Tremorsense\|tremorsense]] out to a range of 30 feet. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute, or until you drop or stow the shield.
