# Edible Book of Recipes
*Wondrous item, minor, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Edible-Book-of-Recipes.webp#right)  


This tome of cooking recipes is enchanted to turn sheets of fine paper into delectable meals. You can write a simple recipe on 1 of the book's pages over the course of 1 minute. As you do, the paper becomes aromatic, smelling like the cuisine you're writing. You can eat the sheet of paper as an action and find that it has the taste, texture, and smell of the food described on its page. The sheet of paper takes the place of a meal.

If you add a more complex recipe to the book that takes at least 10 minutes to write—potentially using sensory language, descriptions of fine ingredients, or illustrations of the dish—eating the delicious sheet of paper provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for 1 day. A creature that eats from the book using one of these complex recipes gains and has their hit point maximum increase by `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) + their proficiency bonus until they finish a long rest. In addition, if the creature is diseased or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], it can reattempt the saving throw to end it. A creature can only gain the benefits of a complex recipe once every 24 hours.

In addition, you can use this book as a spellcasting focus when casting the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Food And Water.md\|create food and water]] spell, should you know it. When you do, the food and drink you create can be aromatic and flavorful: recreating recipes from the book of your choice.

The book can hold up to 50 pages. A book found as treasure usually has `dice:3d10+10|noform|avg` (`3d10 + 10`) blank pages as well as `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) filled pages containing complex recipes.

When all the pages are removed from the book or you attempt to rebind it early, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the tome bursts into flame and leaves the air in a 60-foot radius smelling like wine and fine cooking. The smell remains for 30 days. After 1 minute, the book's tattered remains transform into a bountiful meal, conjuring a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Heroes Feast.md\|heroes' feast]] as if cast by the spell. The book is then destroyed. On any roll other than a 1, the book can be rebound using fine paper costing no less than 5 gp per page.
