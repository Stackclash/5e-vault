# Signet Rings of the Fey Court
*Ring, major, very rare (requires attunement by an elf, half-elf, or other fey creature)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Signet-Rings-of-the-Fey-Court.webp#right)  


This set of wooden rings once belonged to a powerful fey creature who ruled over a domain on their native plane of existence. You must be wearing all four rings in order to attune to and use their magic. While wearing the rings, you know the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Druidcraft.md\|druidcraft]] cantrip. In addition, you gain the elf's Trance racial trait if you don't already have it.

## Season's Resistance

Each of the four rings has a corresponding season: autumn, spring, summer, or winter. Each ring contains 2 charges and regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest. You can expend 1 of a particular ring's charges as a reaction when you take damage of a type corresponding to that ring in order to gain resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering effect: autumn (necrotic damage resistance), spring (radiant damage resistance), summer (fire damage resistance), or winter (cold damage resistance).

## Magic Resistance

Alternatively, you can expend any 2 charges from the rings as a reaction when you're affected by a hostile spell or other magical effect in order to gain advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects until the start of your next turn. The 2 charges do not need to be from the same ring.

Once a ring has no remaining charges, the small landscape adorning the top of it withers until it regains its charges.
