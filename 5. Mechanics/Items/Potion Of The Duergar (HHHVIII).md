# Potion of the Duergar
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you gain the ability to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mage Hand.md\|mage hand]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Minor Illusion.md\|minor illusion]] spells at will for the next hour. This thick, grey potion seems to move around by itself as if acted on by an invisible force.
