# Scroll of Scripts
*Scroll, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Scroll-of-Scripts.webp#right)  


Within this scroll case is a pale scroll with nothing written on it. The scroll is 10 feet long and 1 foot wide. As an action, you can press a portion of the scroll that has writing on it against a willing creature or solid surface; you then peel the scroll off, leaving behind any writing on the creature or surface. The peeled-off writing duplicates the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Illusory Script.md\|illusory script]] spell on the surface: you designate what creatures can see the writing, as well as the writing's alternative appearance, when you peel off the scroll. The text can be as large or as complicated as you like, as long as it fits on the scroll. Each time you peel off the scroll, that portion of the scroll ceases to be magical (in 1-foot increments) and is destroyed.
