# Potion of the Gestalt
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

As part of drinking this potion, you must first drop a small piece of a humanoid's body into it such as: a hair, a drop of blood, or a nail. When you drink this potion, your body transforms into a duplicate of whoever's body part you dropped into the potion for the next 6 hours. Your racial abilities change to match your new body, as does your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. You do not gain any class abilities, spells, or proficiencies, however. While transformed in this way, you are able to perfectly imitate the voice and mannerisms of your chosen humanoid, and you have advantage on any Charisma checks made to persuade other people of your stolen identity. This thick potion constantly shifts inside its bottle, creating images inside its liquid of whomever is holding it.
