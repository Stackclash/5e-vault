# Orange Cicatrizer's Debt
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement by a creature with a wisdom score of 17 or higher)*

This wide-collared necklace is made with beads, precious metals, and amber. While you have at least half your Hit Dice remaining, you can use an action to spend 1 of them and regain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier plus the maximum number possible on the die.

The necklace has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, ritualistic burn scars appear on your chest and upper arms: the mark of the fireweaver. The scars are painless, but remain until you're no longer attuned to the necklace and are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell or similar magic.

While wearing the necklace, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to call upon the fireweaver's talents using the following commands:

## "Burn the Affliction!"

When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes a saving throw against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], diseased, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], you can expend 1 of the necklace's charges as a reaction to grant that creature a bonus to the save equal to `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`). Regardless of whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, the creature also gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the roll's bonus.

## "Let the Flame Protect You!"

As a bonus action, you can expend 2 of the necklace's charges to ward a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you against harm. A warded creature has resistance to all damage. Each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage. If the damage was dealt by an attacker within 5 feet of the warded creature, the attacker also takes `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 hour or until you end it using another bonus action. You can only have one ward active at a time. When another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to transfer the ward to that creature instead. You make this decision before the damage is dealt. Alternatively, you can transfer the ward as a bonus action to another creature within range.

## "Ravage and Weave!"

If you've taken damage from a hostile creature since the end of your last turn, you can use an action to expend 3 of the necklace's charges to call upon a magical fire. Roll `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) and record the total. You can assign any of that roll to either "ravage" or "weave," up to the total amount, which are described below.

## Ravage

Each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the "ravage" number on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

## Weave

Each friendly creature within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the "weave" number. If a creature is suffering from a condition or effect, such as blindness or a charm, that creature can immediately make a saving throw with advantage against it. On a success, the condition or effect ends.

## Flaw

The Orange Cicatrizer's debt compels its wearer to treat and tend to those who are injured the best way they know how. While attuned to the necklace, you gain the following flaw: "I will mend the flesh together by any means necessary." In addition, if you are attuned to the necklace for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty drives you to hyperfocus your craft onto one person. You or your GM determine who your "eternal patient" is and you put their healing needs before all. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you are already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to the Red Queen's burden becomes your sovereign leader, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell, but not while you are attuned to the necklace.
