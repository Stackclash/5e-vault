# Familiar Lens
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Familiar-Lens.webp#right)  


This charming wood and brass box has a pair of domed glass lenses on its front. A small button sits on top of the box. While you're looking through another creature's senses or through a magical sensor, such as by the find familiar or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] spell or a similar magical effect, you can use a bonus action to press the button on top of the box. While the button remains pressed, the box's lenses light up to project a silent duplicate of what you see through the other creature's senses or magical sensor. The projection can only be seen when it's pointed toward a wall or other solid surface within 10 feet of the box. The projection's size depends on the distance of the solid surface, spanning up to 5 feet across and 3 feet tall when shown at 10 feet away, or as small as 1 foot across and 7 inches tall when shown at 1 foot away. When you return to your normal senses or are no longer holding the button, the projection ends.
