# Quicksilver Clay
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Quicksilver-Clay.webp#right)  


This small orb of silver, watery liquid is strangely dry to the touch. While holding the 1-inch-diameter metallic sphere in the palm of your hand, you can mentally control the form that it takes using an action. The form stretches and turns into the imagined shape and remains centered in your hand. Regardless of the form, it can be no larger than the palm of your hand and is always a liquid. The form returns to its natural orb state when you end your focus on the quicksilver clay (no action required) or it leaves your hand.

Eating or drinking the liquid is harmless, but takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) days to exit the body.
