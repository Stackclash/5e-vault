# Patch of the Open Eye
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Patch-of-the-Open-Eye.webp#right)  


This canvas patch can be magically attached to a piece of clothing by pressing it against the clothing for 1 minute. The patch remains on the clothing until it falls off or you use an action to remove it. While it's attached to a piece of clothing, the eye's pupil will occasionally dart off to the side before returning back to the center.

While the patch is attached to a piece of clothing you're wearing, you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Surprised\|surprised]] at the start of combat. Once the patch prevents you from being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Surprised\|surprised]] in this way, it falls off. Alternatively, you can choose to peel off the patch as part of making a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check. You make this decision after you roll the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`), but before knowing the result of the check. When you do, roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and add it to the total.

Once the patch has been removed from a piece of clothing it's attached to, the patch loses its magic and becomes a mundane patch. If the magic patch is removed from a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Robe Of Useful Items.md\|robe of useful items]], the patch has a 50 percent chance to keep its magical properties and can be reattached to a piece of clothing again.
