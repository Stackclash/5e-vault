# The Tyrant's Twinblades, Vincere and Punire
*Melee Weapon, very rare (requires attunement by an evil creature)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/tyrant-twinblades.jpg#right]]  

- **Damage**: 1d6 P
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], Martial
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

If you are a neutral character, these black iron shortswords function as normal weapons with no bonus or special properties. If you are good, touching either weapon deals `dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage to you. If you are an evil character, you can use Vincere and Punire as magic weapons with the following properties.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons. Once per round, if both blades strike a single foe, they deal an extra `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage.

When you score a critical hit with either blade, roll a `dice: d6|avg` (`d6`) on the Devils row of the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Servitors.md\|Servitors]] chart (page 31). Flames burst from the ground and the rolled servitor appears. This servitor fights for you and obeys your commands. They return to Hell after 1 minute or if they drop to 0 hit points.

If this weapon strikes a demon, it shackles it and pulls it down to Hell, removing it from the battle.
