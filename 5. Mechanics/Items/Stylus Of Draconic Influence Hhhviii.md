# Stylus of Draconic Influence
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This stylus has 8 charges. While holding this stylus, you may spend 1 minute and a number of charges to cast the glyph of warding spell, choosing the Spell Glyph option and infusing it with a spell chosen from the following list: charm person (1 charge), fear (3 charges), confusion (4 charges), dominate person (5 charges), mass suggestion (6 charges). All spells are cast at their lowest possible level and all spells use your spell save DC. If you do not have a spell save DC, the DC is set to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.

This item recovers `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) charges at dawn. If you use the last charge, there is a 10% chance chance that it crumbles into dust and becomes useless.
