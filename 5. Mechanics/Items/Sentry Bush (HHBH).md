# Sentry Bush
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A scraggly brush found only on high altitudes, its bitter twigs produce an incredibly potent stimulant that when brewed into a tea, can completely replace one's need to sleep. Due to its inaccessible location, but widely sought-after use, mountain clans are often found carrying them in their caravan to trade to people that need to stay awake for long periods of time.

## Effect:

After preparing this herb, you gain all the benefits of 8 hours of sleep (or the equivalent form of dormancy for your race). You still need to rest for at least 8 hours in order to benefit from a long rest.
