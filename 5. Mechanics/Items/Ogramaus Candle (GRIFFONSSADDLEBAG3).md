# Ogramau's Candle
*Wondrous item, minor, very rare*

This blood red candle is made from a sickly combination of necrotic organs, but smells like heady herbs while lit. After burning for 1 hour, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any undead that enters the candle's dim light for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. On a successful save, 1 minute is deducted from the candle's total burn time and the creature must immediately repeat the saving throw. If it succeeds for a second time in this way, it ignores the candle's effects until the start of its next turn. A creature that's turned ignores this property of the candle.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the candle as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within the candle's dim light. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dodge\|Dodge]] action.

Alternatively, you can use an action to plant the candle on the skull or head of a corpse, allowing its wax to affix itself to the new base. While it's affixed to the head, you can speak the candle's command word to deduct 5 minutes from its total burn time to ask the corpse up to five questions, as described by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Dead.md\|speak with dead]] spell.
