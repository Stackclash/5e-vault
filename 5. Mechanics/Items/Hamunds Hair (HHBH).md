# Hamund's Hair
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

Yes, this is a herb discovered by none other than I, Hamund Holderhek! This thick grey moss resembles the facial hair of none other than yours truly, and is just as hard, steely, and useful as its namesake.This moss is in fact usually found near deposits of iron located in places of great magical power, such as planar portals, ritual sites, or ancient temples. While difficult to harvest, this moss is a versatile material that is more akin to lightweight, flexible steel than a simple plant.

## Effect:

You may spend 3 hours applying this herb to armour which involves twisting and weaving the durable yet flexible strands into that armour's weakest areas. After this hour, the armour permanently imparts a +1 bonus to AC when worn. This herb cannot be applied to armour that already has a bonus to AC or to shields.
