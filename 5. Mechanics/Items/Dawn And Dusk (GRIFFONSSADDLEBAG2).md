# Dawn and Dusk
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Dawn-and-Dusk.webp#right)  


You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which also has the light property. The weapon transforms at different times of the day. At dawn, the weapon's form becomes a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]], whose head is ringed with a line of radiating spikes. At dusk, it becomes a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sickle.md\|sickle]] with star designs along its crescent edge. A target hit with the mace takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) radiant damage. A target hit with the sickle takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) necrotic damage.
