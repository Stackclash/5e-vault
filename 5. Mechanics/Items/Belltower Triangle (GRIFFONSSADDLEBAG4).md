# Belltower Triangle
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Belltower-Triangle.webp#right)  


This brass triangle comes with a dangling set of bells and a beater in the shape of a clock's hand. When you strike the triangle using an action, it rings until the start of your next turn. The triangle emits a soft tone, like a bell struck with a soft hammer, that's audible out to a range of 120 feet. For the duration, any creature that hears the sound magically knows what time of day it is, up to the nearest quarter hour. Once this property of the triangle has been used, it can't be used again until midday or midnight, whichever comes first.
