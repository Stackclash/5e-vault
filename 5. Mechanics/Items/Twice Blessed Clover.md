# Twice-Blessed Clover
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

An auspicious variety of clover, identifiable by its seven leaves and faint glow. It is extremely rare due to the highly-specific circumstances of its creationâ€”the clover is actually created when a capricious noble of the Feywild makes a connection with a lawful-good celestial or deity. This unlikely pairing causes a clover in the Multiverse to spontaneously transform into one that is now said to be "twice-blessed".

## Effect:

As a bonus action, you may crush this clover in your hand. If you do so, any attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws you make until the start of your next turn are made with advantage. When used once, this herb becomes useless.
