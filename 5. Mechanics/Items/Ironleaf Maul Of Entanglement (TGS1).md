- **Damage**: 2d6 B

- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

Despite the head of this maul being made from vines, it seems impossibly solid and carries with it a formidable heft. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The maul has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a Medium or smaller target with the maul, you can expend a charge to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage and is restrained by thorny vines until the end of its next turn. The DC for this property is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.
