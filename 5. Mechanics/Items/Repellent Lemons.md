# Repellent Lemons
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Said to be one of the most sour fruits in existence, the mere smell of a repellent lemon is enough to send most animals running around due to how caustic it is to their sensitive noses.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, creatures with the beast type with an Intelligence score less than 4 that can smell you instinctively avoid you and cannot willingly approach you unless they succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their turn.
