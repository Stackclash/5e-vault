# Horn of Silent Alarm
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  


This horn has 4 charges. When you use an action to blow it, one creature of your choice can hear the horn's blare, provided the creature is within 600 feet of the horn and not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]]. No other creature hears sound coming from the horn. The horn regains `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) expended charges daily at dawn.
