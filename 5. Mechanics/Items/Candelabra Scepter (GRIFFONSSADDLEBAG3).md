# Candelabra Scepter
*Rod, major, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This brass scepter has four magic candles at its top, which spring alight while the scepter is held. The candles shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can use a bonus action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light, to a maximum of 40 feet each or a minimum of 5 feet each. Regardless of how long the candles burn for, their height never changes. Neither water nor wind can extinguish the candles.

While the scepter has at least one magic candle, you can use an action while holding it to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scorching Ray.md\|scorching ray]] spell from it, using your spell attack bonus. Alternatively, you can point the scepter and unleash a wide torrent of flame from it, creating a line of fire 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, which consumes and incinerates one of the magical candles as part of the effect. Each creature within the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes `dice:10d6|noform|avg` (`10d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. Even when a candle is lost in this way, its firelight remains floating above the empty candleholder.

When there are no candles in the scepter, you can use an action to create a cloud of smoke around you. The smoke heavily obscures the area in a 20-foot-radius sphere, centered on the scepter, which spreads around corners and moves with the scepter. The cloud lasts for 1 hour or until dispersed by magical wind. While holding the scepter, the smoke doesn't impede your vision. Once this property of the scepter has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

The scepter regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended candles daily at dawn.
