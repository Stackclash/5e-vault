You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. As a bonus action, you may cause the stinger on the end of this whip to exude a noxious poison. The next creature you successfully hit with this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]]. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the target is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used this ability cannot be used again until you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack.
