# Celestial Sunrise (Uncommon)
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Celestial-Sunrise.webp#right)  


The following [[5. Mechanics/Items/Celestial Sunrise (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|celestial sunrise]] is an uncommon variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.

When you drink this potion, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, for the next 8 hours. In addition, the light cast from your mouth due to the potion's common effects increases, casting bright light out to 40 feet and dim light for an additional 40 feet instead.
