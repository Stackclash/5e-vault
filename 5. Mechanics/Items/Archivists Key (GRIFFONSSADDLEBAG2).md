# Archivist's Key
*Wondrous item, minor, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Archivists-Key.webp#right)  


This magical key is one of several made by a secret order of historians and archivists. While holding the key, you can use an action to twist the key, as if you were unlocking a door. When you do, a magical, spectral door slowly appears in front of you over the course of 1 minute, duplicating the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mordenkainens Magnificent Mansion.md\|magnificent mansion]] spell with the following change. The dwelling always includes a large library that magically includes copies of books, scrolls, maps, and more. The library does not count toward the total amount of space created by the spell. Its contents are strangely organized and seemingly change each time the key is used. A creature can visit the library and attempt to uncover a piece of knowledge, such as ancient poetry, the history of a forgotten kingdom, or the family lineage of a tyrannical king. The GM determines the checks and DCs needed to locate a given piece of information. For example, a book of foreign nursery rhymes may be easy to find, but a copy of necromantic research documents would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.

When the spell ends, the key can't be used this way again for 24 hours.
