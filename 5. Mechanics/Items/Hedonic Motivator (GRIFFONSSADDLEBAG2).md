This magic whip once belonged to an especially controlling succubus or incubus. The whip has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to lash out with it against a friendly creature within 10 feet of you. That creature gains one of the following benefits of your choice:

- The creature gains `dice:2d4+4|noform|avg` (`2d4 + 4`) temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute.  
- The creature can add `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
