# Griffon Key Loop
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Griffon-Key-Loop.webp#right)  


This leather key loop is stylized in the fashion of the legendary [[5. Mechanics/Items/The Griffons Saddlebag (TGS1).md\|griffon's saddlebag]], a classic motif in children's fiction. You can attach a key to the key loop by holding them together for 1 minute. When you do, the key is shunted into an extradimensional space. You can use an action to speak the key loop's command word, causing one or more of the attached keys to reappear on the loop (your choice). Speaking the command word again causes them to disappear once more. You can have up to 10 keys attached to the key loop in this way at a time, and can remove one by gently pulling on it for 1 minute.

While holding the key loop, you can touch it to a lock whose key has been attached to the loop. When you do, the lock becomes unlocked or locked (your choice), as if you had used its key. When you shake the key loop, you can faintly hear the sound of its keys jingling.
