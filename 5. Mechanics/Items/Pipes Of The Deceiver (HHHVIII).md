# Pipes of the Deceiver
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This pipe has 10 charges. If you are proficient in a wind instrument, you may expend charges and use your action to play this pipe and use one of the following abilities of your choice:

## Spellcasting

You use the pipe to cast one of the following spells of your choice: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Alter Self.md\|alter self]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animate Dead.md\|animate dead]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] (4 chargeS), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Major Image.md\|major image]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Modify Memory.md\|modify memory]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mislead.md\|mislead]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Nondetection.md\|nondetection]] (3 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sending.md\|sending]] (3 charges).

## Frightful Word

You expend 2 charges and target one creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] in this way, the target must take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Twisting Words

You expend 3 charges and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 minute. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] target can repeat the saving throw if you deal any damage to it. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If you use this ability on a creature already [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you in this way, that creature must make the saving throw again. On a failure, you decide how that target acts on its next turn.

This pipe regains all expended charges at dawn.
