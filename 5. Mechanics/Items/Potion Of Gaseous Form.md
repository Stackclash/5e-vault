# Potion of Gaseous Form
*Potion, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gaseous Form.md\|gaseous form]] spell for 1 hour (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#concentration\|concentration]] required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
