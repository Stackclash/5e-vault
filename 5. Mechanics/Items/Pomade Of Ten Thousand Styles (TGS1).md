# Pomade of Ten Thousand Styles
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Pomade-of-Ten-Thousand-Styles.webp#right)  


This canister of waxy pomade has magical properties, allowing you to change your hair's color, style, thickness, and length (up to 1 foot longer or shorter per use). The canister steadily replenishes its pomade over time. It can hold up to 4 uses at a time and regains `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) expended uses each day at dawn. Using 1 use of the pomade takes 1 minute.

Once you've used this product in your hair, it returns to its normal appearance after you finish a long rest. Hair produced by the pomade that's been cut off turns to dust after 24 hours. If you use the pomade every day for 7 days to make the same changes, the changes become permanent.
