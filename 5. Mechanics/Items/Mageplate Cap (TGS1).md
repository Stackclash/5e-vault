# Mageplate Cap
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a wizard or sorcerer)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Mageplate-Cap.webp#right)  


This pointed hat is fitted with chain and metal that have been enchanted with abjuration magic. The cap has 2 charges and regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While wearing the cap, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mage Armor.md\|mage armor]] spell from it, targeting only yourself. When the spell is cast in this way, the arcane armor appears platelike and changes your base AC to 15 + your Dexterity modifier instead of the spell's normal change to your AC.
