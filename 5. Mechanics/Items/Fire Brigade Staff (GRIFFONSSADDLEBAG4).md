# Fire Brigade Staff
*Staff, weapon, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Fire-Brigade-Staff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff is encircled with dangling strips of paper. At its top is a special reservoir of water; the reservoir holds 10 gallons of water. It regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended gallons of water daily at dawn, and it can't be refilled by any other mundane or magical means. Regardless of the amount of water inside, the staff always weighs 4 pounds.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to use one of the properties below, expending the respective number of gallons of water for each one:

## Spells

You can cast one of the following spells from the staff: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Control Water.md\|control water]] (4 gallons, save DC 15), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Or Destroy Water.md\|create or destroy water]] (1 gallon per spell level, up to 9th), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Energy.md\|protection from energy]] (fire damage only; 3 gallons).

## Douse Fire

(1 gallon) You extinguish all nonmagical flames within a 30-foot square, centered on a point that you can see within 60 feet of you.

Alternatively, you can use a reaction when a creature that you can see takes fire damage. Choose a number of gallons to expend: you then reduce that fire damage by an amount equal to 5 times the number of expended gallons.

## Flood

(3 gallons) You can sweep the staff in front of you to create a wave of crashing water. Each creature within a 30-foot cone, originating from you, must then make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. On a success, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

## Water Bubble

(3 gallons) You surround a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you with a bubble of water that's filled with air. The bubble lasts for 1 hour and moves with the target, remaining centered on it. For the duration, the target has resistance to fire damage and is under the effects of the water walk spell. When a target surrounded by a bubble takes fire damage, the bubble pops and evaporates, creating a ring of steam. The ring of steam is a 10-foot-thick wall of fog in a circle around the target's location. The fog heavily obscures the area. If a target surrounded by a bubble takes piercing damage, the bubble immediately pops.

When the bubble pops, any other creature within 5 feet of the surrounded target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage, or fire damage if the bubble turns into steam.
