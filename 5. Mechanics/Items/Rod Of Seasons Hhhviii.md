# Rod of Seasons
*Rod, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This rod has 4 charges. While holding it, you can use your action to swing it, expending a charge and creating a magical, 30-foot radius aura centered on the rod for the next 10 minutes. This aura becomes a self-contained atmosphere with an effect determined by the season that you designate when you swing the rod which you may choose from below:

## Autumn's Bounty

The aura becomes filled with the calming breezes of autumn. Whenever a creature inside the aura casts a spell by using a spell slot, the caster has a 10% chance chance to immediately recover use of that spell slot. In addition, creatures in the aura have resistance to lightning damage.

## Spring's Rejuvenation

The aura becomes filled with the sweet aromas of spring. Whenever a creature in the aura rolls dice to recover hit points, they may ignore results of 1 and 2 and reroll those dice, taking the new result even if it is another 1 or 2. In addition, creatures in the aura have resistance to poison damage.

## Summer's Vitality

The aura becomes filled with the energizing heat of summer. Any creature that makes a weapon attack in the aura may choose to either do so with advantage, or to roll an additional damage dice on a successful hit. The decision must be made before the attack roll is made. In addition, creatures in the aura have resistance to fire damage.

## Winter's Rest

The aura becomes filled with the slowing cold of winter. The space within the aura is considered difficult terrain, and any creature that ends their turn inside the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. This exhaustion is removed once the creature leaves the aura. In addition, creatures in the aura have resistance to cold damage.

If this rod is swung again before 10 minutes has passed, the user may expend another charge to change the aura's effect to a different season, ending the original one in the process and refreshing the duration. This rod regains all expended charges at dawn. If you use the last charge, there is a 75% chance chance that the rod crumbles into dust and becomes useless.
