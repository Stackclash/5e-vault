# Couatl Herald's Lash
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Whip.md\|whip]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Couatl-Heralds-Lash.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This slender whip's grip is feathered and comfortable to wield. Its weight has been magically reduced and it gently sways on its own. This weapon has the light property. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Once on each of your turns when you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action and use this whip to make an attack against a Medium or smaller creature, you can choose to forgo the attack and force the target to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw instead. On a failure, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by the whip and takes `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) bludgeoning damage as it's constricted. If you replace another attack with the whip in this way against a target who's already grappled by it, that target becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the whip instead upon failing the saving throw. A target grappled or restrained by the whip can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, it is no longer grappled or restrained by the whip.

Until this grapple or restraint ends, you can't use the whip against a different target. Moving more than 10 feet away from the target or dropping the whip ends the grapple or restraint.

## Flight of the Couatls

While you're attuned to 3 items with this property, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, your flying speed increases by 30 feet instead.
