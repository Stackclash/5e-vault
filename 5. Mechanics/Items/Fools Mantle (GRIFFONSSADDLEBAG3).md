# Fool's Mantle
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Fools-Mantle-.webp#right)  


This hooded mantle of bells and pomp jingles with every step you take. While wearing the mantle, you can use a bonus action to change its appearance, even if you aren't attuned to it. The new appearance is illusory, which doesn't hold up to physical inspection, and must be either a cape, hat, hood, or mantle. The mantle's appearance remains this way until you use a bonus action to change it again or remove the mantle. If you're attuned to it, the bells only jingle when you choose.

While attuned to the mantle and wearing it, you gain a bonus to any Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check you make equal to your Charisma modifier (maximum +2). Similarly, you gain a bonus to any Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) check you make equal to your Dexterity modifier (maximum +2).

## Masterful Tumble

You can use your reaction whenever you take damage from an attack to make a Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check. The DC for this check is equal to the damage you take, with a minimum DC of 10. On a success, the damage is halved, and if you would have fallen [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] as part of taking that damage, you don't. On a failure, you take the damage as normal, and this property of the mantle can't be used again for 1 hour. If you are a rogue with the Uncanny [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dodge\|Dodge]] feature, you automatically succeed on the Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check, and if your speed isn't 0, you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
