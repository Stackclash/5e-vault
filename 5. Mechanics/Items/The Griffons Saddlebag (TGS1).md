# The Griffon's Saddlebag
*Wondrous item, major, artifact*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/The-Griffons-Saddlebag.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

These leather bags have the stylized face of a griffon on their front and appear across the multiverse in strange locations. One may be found in the belly of a dragon, while another in the limbs of a great tree. Regardless of where it's found, a *Griffon's Saddlebag* is typically discovered by an adventurer with a destiny.

The saddlebags are made by a great, six-armed griffon on the Astral Plane. Believed by some to be a demigod of pocket dimensions and craftsmen everywhere, the griffon is a patron of artificers and creators across the multiverse. The griffon creates magical items in its great forge using materials collected from various planes of existence to add to its collection. While no one knows exactly how to contact the griffon, it has a knack for knowing what items are needed by whom.

## Superior Holding

This 1-foot-wide bag always weighs 3 pounds, regardless of what's inside it. It functions as a bag of holding that can only be pierced by another artifact. Placing a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Holding.md\|bag of holding]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hewards Handy Haversack.md\|Heward's handy haversack]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Portable Hole.md\|portable hole]], or similar item inside the extradimensional space created by the saddlebag, or vice versa, destroys the extradimensional item but leaves the saddlebag unharmed. Any item stored within the other extradimensional space is magically moved to the space within the saddlebag instead. If doing so overloads the bag, random contents from either space are scattered in the Astral Plane.

## Magic Courier

At the GM's discretion, the saddlebag's beak opens up to reveal a letter. The magical script can be read by all creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The note is a delivery request or similar that includes the name of an item as well as either specific or vague descriptions of a person or place. At the bottom of the letter is a price listed in coins or other form of payment, as well as a date or time depending on its urgency.

If the saddlebag is brought to the described person or place within the allotted time, it dispenses the magical item into the hand of the appropriate recipient. If the payment isn't received by the bag within 1 hour of dispensing the magic item, the item vanishes and is lost. After receiving the payment for an item in this way, the bag's beak reopens to dispense a reward for the courier.

## Sell Magic Items

The saddlebag has a connection to the griffon's forge on the Astral Plane. Depending on the magic item, you can sell a magic item to the saddlebag for half the cost of its base price.

## Spells

The saddlebag has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the saddlebag, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] (1 charge), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Legend Lore.md\|legend lore]] (5 charges).

## Additional Spells

At the GM's discretion, such as after reaching certain milestones or completing *Magic Courier* quests, the saddlebag may offer the following additional spells that can be cast from it: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blink.md\|blink]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dimension Door.md\|dimension door]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Divination.md\|divination]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Etherealness.md\|etherealness]] (7 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fly.md\|fly]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mordenkainens Magnificent Mansion.md\|Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion]] (7 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md\|plane shift]] (7 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Leomunds Secret Chest.md\|Leomund's secret chest]] (4 charges).

## Sentience

The saddlebag is a sentient chaotic neutral bag with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.

The bag can speak, read, and understand Common. When in the presence of only creatures it trusts, the bag's beak moves when it speaks. Otherwise, the bag communicates telepathically with its wearer. The bag can speak and communicate with griffons.

## Personality

The bag's purpose is to carry, collect, and deliver magic items. Different bags have different personalities, but they are for the most part largely pleasant to talk to. Their voices are bird-like and are filled with occasional coos and squawks, and their stitched eyes widen, squint, and move expressively.

If the bag's wearer or allies fail to fulfill *Magic Courier* quests, it may stop offering its magic to them. If it does, their items may be lost or inaccessible within the bag, or potentially spat out. While the bag provides the names of item recipients and delivery locations, it doesn't know any more information than what was provided to it by the astral griffon. Regardless, it does its best to help its wearer and allies find the specified person or location on the letter.

## Destroying the Griffon's Saddlebag

While there is no way to permanently destroy the saddlebag, piercing it with an artifact returns it to its place of origin for repair before it's returned to the multiverse in a new location. Placing a *Griffon's Saddlebag* inside the extradimensional space created by another *Griffon's Saddlebag* returns both items to their place of origin and sends all the items stored within them to the griffon's forge on the Astral Plane.
