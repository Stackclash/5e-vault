# Ring of Eldritch Ire
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement by a warlock)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Eldritch-Ire.webp#right)  


This cold, warped ring has three yellow gemstones adorning its surface that swivel and move like strange eyes. This ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the ring, you can expend 1 of its charges as a bonus action to mark an unmarked creature that you can see within 60 feet of you for 1 hour. The mark is lost if you fall unconscious or end it early using a bonus action. A marked creature appears to be shrouded in a strange, sharpening mist that magically helps you focus. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against marked creatures, and marked creatures have a âˆ’1 penalty to saving throws against spells you cast.

You know a marked creature's general distance and direction from you at all times while it's on the same plane of existence as you. In addition, you perceive a marked creature within 60 feet of you as though you had truesight, and can see through any illusion that stands between you and the marked creature.
