# Realmswarden Greataxe
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greataxe.md\|greataxe]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Realmswarden-Greataxe.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 O
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

This ancient stone axe hilt is intricately carved. At its center is a gap that houses a single, perfect diamond that's magically suspended in place and glows with an uncanny energy. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a wide blade of pure prismatic light to radiate from the axe's head, or make the blade disappear. The axe's blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals force damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, that target takes an extra `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) radiant damage.

While the blade persists, you can use a bonus action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

The light that comes from the diamond at the axe's center and forms the blade can be wrought to create powerful, destructive glyphs. Over the course of 1 minute, you can trace a glyph onto the surface of the axe, starting with the gem at its center, to recreate the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Symbol.md\|symbol]] spell (save DC 17) with the following changes:

- The glyph you create as part of the spell exists on the axe and moves with it.  
- The glyph can only be triggered when you hit a creature with the axe. Once that creature makes a saving throw against the glyph's effect, the spell ends.  
- The spell only affects the target that triggered the glyph.  
- Aberrations and undead have disadvantage on the saving throw to resist the spell's effects.  

Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until 12 hours have passed. You can only have one glyph on the axe in this way at a time.
