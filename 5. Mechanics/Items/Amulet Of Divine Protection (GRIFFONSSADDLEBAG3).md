# Amulet of Divine Protection
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Amulet-of-Divine-Protection.webp#right)  


While wearing this amulet, you gain the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shield Of Faith.md\|shield of faith]] spell, granting you a +2 to bonus to AC. Whenever you take damage for the first time on a turn while wearing it, you must make a Constitution saving throw (as if you were [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentrating]] on a spell). On a failed save, the amulet's effect is suppressed for 1 minute. Maintaining the effect of this amulet does not prevent you from [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentrating]] on a different spell.
