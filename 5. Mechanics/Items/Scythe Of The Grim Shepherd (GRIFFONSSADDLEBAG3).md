# Scythe of the Grim Shepherd
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scythe-of-the-Grim-Shepherd.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

The sharpened horns and skull of a great ram rest atop this gnarled staff to form a twin-bladed scythe. On a hit, this weapon deals either bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice), plus an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage. It gains 1 charge whenever a creature with a challenge rating of 1 or higher within 60 feet of you is slain, up to a maximum of 10 charges. The staff loses all charges whenever you finish a long rest or if your attunement to it ends. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges for the following properties:

## Circle of Death

You can use an action to expend 6 of the weapon's charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Circle Of Death.md\|circle of death]] spell from it (save DC 16).

## Consume Soul

You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 of the weapon's charges to regain `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) hit points for each expended charge. If the grim ram is summoned, it also regains any lost hit points.

## Lead the Damned

You can use an action to expend 1 of the weapon's charges to attempt to bring an undead creature that you can see under your control. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 hour or until it takes any damage. A creature with immunity to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] condition still makes this saving throw, becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] as normal on a failure, but makes the roll with advantage. An undead [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way is indifferent toward you and your companions and automatically fails any saving throw against an effect that would turn it, such as by a cleric's Channel Divinity.

## Summon Grim Ram

You can use an action to expend 2 of the weapon's charges to summon a grim ram: an all-black goat with four horns. The goat appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, and remains until it's reduced to 0 hit points or until you use this property of the weapon again. The goat is friendly to you and your companions. It uses the statistics for a giant goat, but has immunity to necrotic damage and deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage to any creature it hits with a melee attack. The goat obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it. In combat, the goat shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dodge\|Dodge]] action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.
