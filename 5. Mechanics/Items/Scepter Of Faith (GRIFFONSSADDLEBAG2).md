# Scepter of Faith
*Rod, major, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Scepter-of-Faith.webp#right)  


This rod is imbued with the last remaining magic from a pious saint. While holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shield Of Faith.md\|shield of faith]] spell from it on a creature other than you within range. When an attacker within 60 feet of you deals damage to a creature under the effect of this spell, you can use your reaction to cause a spectral shield to appear before it and push the attacker 5 feet away from the creature.

In addition, while holding the rod, you can use an action to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Guardian Of Faith.md\|guardian of faith]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find The Path.md\|find the path]] spell. When cast in this way, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find The Path.md\|find the path]] can only be used to find the route to a temple or other holy site. Once the rod has cast either of these spells in this way, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
