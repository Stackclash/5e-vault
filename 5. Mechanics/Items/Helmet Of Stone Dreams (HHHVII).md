# Helmet of Stone Dreams
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This stone helmet resembles the petrified brain of a stone giant. If you spend your action picturing an item no larger than 1 square foot. While wearing and attuned to this item, a stone version of that item appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This stone disappears after 1 hour, or if it is destroyed. Once you have created 5 items in a day using this ability, you may not use it again until the next dawn.
