# Deathbomb Arrow
*Ammunition ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Arrow.md\|arrow]]), very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Deathbomb-Arrow.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

This arrow is tipped with a round head, which is decorated with a grisly skull. A series of necromantic arcane circles cover the arrow. The arrow detonates when it hits a creature as part of a ranged weapon attack, creating a wave of deathly energy that explodes outward from it. Any creature within 60 feet of the arrow must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any nonmagical plant within the area immediately dies. The arrow is then destroyed.

The save DC changes depending on how close a creature is to the blast: the target of the attack (DC 17), within 10 feet (DC 16), within 30 feet (DC 15), or within 60 feet (DC 13).

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as deathbomb bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
