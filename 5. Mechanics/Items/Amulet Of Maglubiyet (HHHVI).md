# Amulet of Maglubiyet
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this amulet, you gain the ability to spend your action and martial your allies with your resounding leadership. For 1 minute, you may utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that you can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) to its roll provided it can hear and understand you. A creature can benefit from only one of these effects at a time. This effect ends early if you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]].
