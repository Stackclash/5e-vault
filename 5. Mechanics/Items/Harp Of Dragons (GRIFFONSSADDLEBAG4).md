# Harp of Dragons
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Harp-of-Dragons.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This harp is strung with the vocal cords of a felled dragon. As a result, the instrument can create dragonlike effects when Draconic command words are spoken while playing it. The harp is 3 feet tall and weighs 6 pounds. While you're attuned to the harp, you are proficient with it.

While holding the harp, you can use an action to play it and speak one of the following command words in Draconic. Once a command word has been used, that word can't be used again until the next dawn. If an effect requires a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your bard spell save DC.

## "Burn."

The harp creates a magical breath of fire. Each creature in a 30-foot cone, originating from the harp, must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:8d6|noform|avg` (`8d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that's [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

## "Fly."

The harp makes you weightless, granting you a flying speed equal to your walking speed for as long as you continue to play it. Doing so requires your action on each of your turns, up to a maximum of 1 hour.

## "Tailwind."

The harp creates a gust of wind behind you, propelling you and up to four other creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you forward until the end of your next turn. When you use this command word, choose a direction. For the duration, moving in that direction costs you and other affected creatures half as much movement.

## "Terrify."

The harp creates an instantaneous wave of fear, which affects up to four creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature can hear the instrument. Each affected creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] creature can make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
