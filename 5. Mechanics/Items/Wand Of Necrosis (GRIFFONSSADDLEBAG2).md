# Wand of Necrosis
*Wand, major, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wand-of-Necrosis.webp#right)  


This gnarled, wooden branch has grown over one of the severed fingers of a powerful lich, creating a gruesome and deadly wand. The wand has 7 charges. If the wand has at least 1 charge remaining, you have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold it.

While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15, attack bonus +7): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blight.md\|blight]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Finger Of Death.md\|finger of death]] (7 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|inflict wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, plus 1 additional charge to make its range 30 feet), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Enfeeblement.md\|ray of enfeeblement]] (2 charges).

The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand explodes, destroying the wand in a flash of green light that duplicates the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Finger Of Death.md\|finger of death]] spell, targeting only you. If you become a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Zombie.md\|zombie]] as a result of this effect, you are under the command of the nearest [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Lich.md\|MM]] within 100 miles of you, if any.
