# Necrolace
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Necrolace.webp#right)  


This necklace allows you to absorb the life energy of creatures you slay. When you reduce a Small or larger creature who is hostile toward you to 0 hit points, the necklace emits a faint glow and gains 1 charge. The necklace can hold up to 3 charges and contains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) charges when found. You can expend 1 or more charges as a bonus action to turn death into life. You take `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage for each expended charge and heal another creature you can see within 30 feet of you for twice the amount of necrotic damage you took. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you're stable but unconscious. When this happens, the creature is healed for twice the amount of hit points you had remaining before you fell unconscious.
