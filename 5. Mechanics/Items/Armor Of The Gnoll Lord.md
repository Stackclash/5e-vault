# Armor of the Gnoll Lord
*Light Armor, artifact, Crafted Artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + DEX
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20Artifact\|Crafted Artifact]]
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

The savagery of the gnolls is undeniable. So vicious and brutal are they, that they even dream of one day tearing into and dismembering the body of [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Yeenoghu.md\|Yeenoghu]], their own patron deity. Among the most powerful of the gnolls is the myth of a suit of armor crafted from the tanned hide of the Gnoll Lord himself, the gristle and blood soaking into their own skin and giving them demonic power. Far from being disgusted by his followers' brutal veneration, [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Yeenoghu.md\|Yeenoghu]] actually welcomes them to try; it simply means more prey for him to devour.

In order to attune to this item, you must wear it while hunting and killing a humanoid creature without the aid of weapons or magic. After killing them, you must then consume at least 1 pound of their raw flesh. Doing so causes the armor to fuse to your own body, making it act as a second, protective skin that you cannot remove so long as you remain attuned to this item. While attuned to this item, you become more gnoll-like: you become covered in shaggy fur, your eyes become yellow and wild, and your nails and teeth become sharper. As part of this, you may use your nails and teeth as natural weapons to make unarmed strikes. If you hit, this attack deals slashing damage equal to `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) + your Strength modifier and you may make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#grapple\|grapple]] check against your target as a free action as you grip them in a wild frenzy. You return to your original form immediately if your attunement to this item ends.

While wearing this armor, you have a +3 bonus to your AC and are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that is nonmagical.

## Random Properties

The Armor of the Gnoll Lord has the following random properties:

- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial]] properties  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Beneficial Properties.md\|minor beneficial]] properties  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Detrimental Properties.md\|major detrimental]] properties  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  

## Spellcasting

Using this armor, you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] spell at will, and you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fear.md\|fear]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md\|invisibility]] spells up to 3 times each. All expended uses are restored after your next long rest.

## Rampage

While wearing this armor, whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on your turn, you can take a bonus action to move up to half your speed and make an unarmed strike.

## Sadistic Retaliation

Whenever a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see hits you with a weapon attack, you may use your reaction to cause an iron spike—6 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter—to burst from the ground beneath them. That creature must then succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be impaled upon this spike, taking `dice: 4d8|avg|noform` (`4d8`) piercing damage and becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]]. A creature can use an action to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] condition. Spikes disappear at the start of your next turn if nothing is currently impaled on them.

## Savage Warlord

On your turn, you may use your bonus action to target up to 4 willing creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, these creatures are enraged, gaining advantage on melee weapon attack rolls they make and causing attacks rolls against them to have advantage.

## Curse

When you become attuned to this armor, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Yeenoghu.md\|Madness of Yeenoghu table]]* ^[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|See the info tab] and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Armor

This armor can only be destroyed if the creature wearing and attuned to it is killed by the weapon [[5. Mechanics/Items/Heartcleaver.md\|Heartcleaver]]. At this point, the armor will slough off its wearer and dissolve into a useless ichor.
