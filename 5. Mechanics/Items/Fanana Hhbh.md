# Fanana
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A rather whimsical fruit that resembles a bunch of green bananas if each fruit was squashed to the thickness of a fingerâ€”with the result being something that resembles a thick fan. Although the fruit tastes and acts much like a regular banana when ripe, ones that have only recently fruited will have skins filled with gas designed to hasten the ripening of the flesh inside. If these are picked and then burst, the gas is released, creating a surprisingly powerful gust of wind. While this wind is by no means dangerous, it has been used as a source of entertainment by children playing pranks, as well as mild utility in specific circumstances.

## Effect:

This herb has `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) charges, with each charge corresponding to one of the fruits of the herb. As an action, you may expend one or more charges to burst the fruits, releasing pent up gas inside and creating a burst of wind that is 5 feet wide and has a length equal to 5 times the number of charges expended. This wind is powerful enough to snuff out open flames and knock over small objects, but not enough to knock a creature prone.
