# Lens of Insight
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this lens, you may target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You make a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) check contested against the target's Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]). If you win, you magically learn one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]].

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
