# Tarrasque Plate
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Tarrasque-Plate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This impenetrable armor is made from refined fragments of a tarrasque's armored hide and retains some of its original properties. You have resistance to damage from spells and a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you're targeted by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]] spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 6, you are unaffected by the spell, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from you, turning the caster into the target.
