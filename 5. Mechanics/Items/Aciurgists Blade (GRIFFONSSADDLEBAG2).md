# Aciurgist's Blade
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Glaive.md\|glaive]]), major, very rare (requires attunement by a paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Aciurgists-Blade.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This smooth, magic glaive bears holy sigils and oaths down the length of its haft and is always impeccably clean. While holding it, your reach increases by 5 feet when using your Lay on Hands feature.

Once on each of your turns when you expend a spell slot to use your Divine Smite feature on an attack made with this glaive, you can choose one of the following effects to inflict on the target until the start of your next turn. When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can inflict an additional effect for each slot level above 1st, choosing each effect no more than once.

- The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes.  
- The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet.  
- The next time the target takes damage, it takes an additional `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic or radiant damage (your choice).  
- The next attack made against the target is made with advantage.  
- The target can't regain hit points.
