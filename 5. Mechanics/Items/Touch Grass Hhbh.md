# Touch Grass
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

Occasionally, patches of ordinary grass can become imbued with a weak magical presence, usually as a result of ambient spells in the area, or the blood of a magical creature spilling upon it. Regardless of its origin, this phenomenon changes the grass, making it able to absorb and store magic for a brief amount of time. While useless for permanent storage like some magical rings would be, its tendency to release stored spells at the slightest provocation has been turned into an advantage by some mages, who mash the grass into a ball, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#cast%20a%20spell\|cast a spell]] into it, and then lob it at their enemies as a way of extending otherwise range-limited spells.

## Effect:

When you [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#cast%20a%20spell\|cast a spell]] that has a range of touch, you may target this herb instead of the spell's usual targets. If you do so, this herb absorbs that spell to be unleashed upon the next valid target that it touches. As an action, you may throw this herb at a target within 20 feet of you, treating it as a ranged weapon attack. On a successful hit, this herb does no damage, but instead unleashes the spell it had stored inside of it on the target instead. This herb can only absorb one spell at a time and can only hold a spell for 10 minutes, after which the magic dissipates and the spell is wasted. Either way, once this herb has released a stored spell, it breaks apart and becomes useless.
