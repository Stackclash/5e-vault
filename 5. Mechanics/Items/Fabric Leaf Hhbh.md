# Fabric Leaf
*Herb, common, Herb*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHbH/FabricLeaf.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

For generations, the greater world wondered how elves and other fey creatures seemed to be comfortable when they garb themselves in clothes made of leaves. As has recently been discovered, the answer is actually a phenomenon known as 'arboreal fabrication': a randomly occurring event in which some trees produce leaves with the texture and properties of cotton. Unfortunately, the reason behind this occurrence and attempts at replicating them for commercial use are still unknown, and at present can only be foraged from naturally occurring specimens.

## Effect:

This herb contains a number of leaves measuring `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) square feet in area. These leaves do not decompose unless buried in soil, and act almost identically to cotton when sewn together as a fabric.

> My theories for the origin of arboreal fabrication include: a symbiotic insect infestation; enchantments from leyline shifts; a capricious pixie prank; and (my personal favourite) the leaves aren't actually that soft, we're all just too embarrassed to admit that the fey have tricked us into wearing leaves.
