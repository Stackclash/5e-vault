# Mirage Melon
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

While there are many herbs out there that may cause you to see things after eating them, there is only one that causes OTHERS to see things after you eat it. The mirage melon is a magical variant of similar psychedelic fruits that reacts with the visual centre of a creature's brain to cause vivid (if brief) visual effects to literally burst from one's mouth. Usage of these has long been used in traditional storytelling by local cultures to add a visual component to old myths.

## Effect:

You may eat this herb as an action. For the next 10 minutes, your stomach produces a magical gas that causes you to burp at the start of each of your turns, with each burp emitting a luminescent gas that takes the form of a small illusion of your choosing once it leaves your mouth. Sample illusory effects include butterflies or musical notes. These illusions have neither substance or sound, are obviously fake in nature, and disappear at the start of your next turn.
