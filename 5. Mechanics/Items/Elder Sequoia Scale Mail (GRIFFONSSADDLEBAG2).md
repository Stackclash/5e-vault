# Elder Sequoia Scale Mail
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Scale Mail.md\|scale mail]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a druid)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Elder-Sequoia-Scale-Mail.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 45.0 lbs.

This hardy, natural mail is made with leather and protected with the large outer shell of an elder sequoia seed cone. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, while wearing this armor, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a mighty evergreen tree. The tree is 5 feet across at its base and can be up to 40 feet tall. Its branches extend up to 10 feet away from its trunk and must be at least 5 feet above its base.

The tree has hit points equal to 5 times your druid level, AC 20, and vulnerability to fire damage. While you're a tree, you magically retain your normal senses and gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Tremorsense\|tremorsense]] out to a range of 30 feet, but your speed becomes 0, and you can only use your actions to shuffle your limbs (as if by a breeze or rustling creature), revert to your normal form, or use your Wild Shape again.
