# Instrument of the Bards
*Wondrous item, instrument (requires attunement by a bard)*  


An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fly.md\|fly]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md\|invisibility]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Levitate.md\|levitate]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Evil And Good.md\|protection from evil and good]].
