# Healer's Voice
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Healers-Voice.webp#right)  


This silver and gold necklace hums with a healing energy when you speak certain arcane words. Whenever you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Healing Word.md\|healing word]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mass Healing Word.md\|mass healing word]] spell, you can grant one target of the spell 4 temporary hit points for each `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) that rolled a 4. If you roll a 1 on a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`), you can reroll the die. You must use the new roll.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check to calm, heal, or otherwise soothe another creature, you can roll a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) and add it to the total. Once this property of the necklace has been used, it can't be used again until you or another creature has cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Healing Word.md\|healing word]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mass Healing Word.md\|mass healing word]] while wearing the necklace.
