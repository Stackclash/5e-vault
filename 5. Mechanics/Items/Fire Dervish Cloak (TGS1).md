# Fire Dervish Cloak
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Fire-Dervish-Cloak.webp#right)  


This breathable cloak sounds like a crackling fire as it billows behind you and can create a small, fiery cyclone around you as you twirl in it. The cloak has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Once on your turn, you can expend 1, 2, or 3 charges from the cloak by forfeiting 10, 20, or 30 feet of your movement speed for that turn, respectively, in order to spin in place instead. When you do, each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage for each charge you expend in this way.

If a creature takes fire damage from the cloak, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you until the end of your turn.
