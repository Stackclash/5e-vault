The edges of this hulking greatsword are virtually blunt; on a hit, it deals bludgeoning damage, instead of slashing.

A gap splits the blade in two, where a fiery contraption emits a constant blaze. The flame sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While holding the sword, you can use a bonus action to magically extinguish the flame or cause it to reignite. While the flame is alight, the sword deals an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage to any target it hits. When it does, the sword also gains a number of charges equal to the number rolled on the `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`). Any charge gained by the sword is lost after 1 minute.

You can use an action to level the sword in front of you and expend any number of its charges. The flame at the center of the sword then releases a roaring gout of flames in a 5-foot-wide line. The line is 10 feet long if you expend 10 or fewer charges, 20 feet long if you expend 11-20 charges, and 30 feet long if you expend 21-30 charges. Each creature within the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to the number of expended charges, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use a bonus action while holding the sword to vent the flames harmlessly, expending any number of charges each time you do. If the sword reaches more than 30 charges, it immediately erupts in a fiery blast and loses all its charges. Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You automatically fail the saving throw. Any flammable objects within the area that aren't being worn or carried are also ignited.
