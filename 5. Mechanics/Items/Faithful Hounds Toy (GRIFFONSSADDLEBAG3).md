# Faithful Hound's Toy
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Faithful-Hounds-Toy.webp#right)  


This well-chewed dog toy has a small bell inside it. As an action, you can shake the toy and throw it into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. When you do, the sound of a panting dog can be briefly heard as the toy vanishes, duplicating the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mordenkainens Faithful Hound.md\|faithful hound]] spell as if you cast it in that space (attack bonus +7). The spell lasts for the full duration or until you use an action to dismiss it or move more than 100 feet away from the space. Regardless of when the spell ends, the toy reappears on your person after 8 hours.
