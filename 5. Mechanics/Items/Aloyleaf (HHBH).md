# Aloyleaf
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

An absolutely wondrous leaf found on bushes and hedges that have grown on top of hard metal deposits. In order to process the poor soil quality, these plants excrete the excess minerals out through their leaves, resulting in them taking on both a metallic lustre, as well as a durability that matches steel. Due to their light weight and beautiful shiny green colour, these leaves are highly sought after for armour materials, and there are many that make a living simply walking between aloyleaf plants and harvesting any new growths they encounter.

## Effect:

This herb provides enough leaves to cover `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) square feet. These leaves are as hard as steel, but are as lightweight as normal leaves and never decompose unless buried under soil.
