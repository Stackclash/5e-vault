This shortbow can cause an arrow to shatter and unleash a devastating spray of magical shrapnel. You can say the weapon's command word as an action to destroy 1 nonmagical arrow and send splintering shards of arcane energy out in front of you. When you do, creatures within a 15-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, an affected creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) magical piercing damage, or `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) if the creature was within 5 feet of you.
