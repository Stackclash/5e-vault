# Shadow Ink
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shadow-Ink.webp#right)  


Once penned, this special ink can only be seen and read in total darkness. When in darkness, any written or tattooed words, illustrations, or other marks made with this ink glow with a soft, colored light. One bottle of shadow ink has enough ink to fill 10 pages with writing, illustrations, or other such markings.

A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] spell reveals only that there is something faintly magical about the area where this ink has been used, but does not reveal the kind of magic or how to interact with it.
