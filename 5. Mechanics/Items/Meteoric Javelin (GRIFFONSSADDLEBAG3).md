- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has three command words, which activate the following properties. Once a property has been used, that property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Orbital Maneuver

When you make a ranged attack with the javelin and miss, you can speak the javelin's first command word (no action required) to repeat the attack against a different target that you can see. You make this attack as if you were standing in the original target's space.

## Recall

While the javelin is within 120 feet of you and not being held by another creature, you can use a bonus action to speak the javelin's second command word to cause it to fly to your open hand or fall to the ground at your feet (your choice).

## Satellite Crash

While holding the javelin, you can use an action to speak the javelin's third command word and throw it 120 feet into the air, where it follows and hovers above you. You can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to speak this command word again to cause it to plummet down in a fiery blast onto a target that you can see within 120 feet of you. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. The javelin then flies toward the target from its location above you, ignoring the disadvantage imposed on long range attacks and potentially the effects of certain types of cover. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage. Hit or miss, the javelin creates a flaming impact on the ground. The target and each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If there isn't 120 feet of space above you, or if you don't speak the command word again within 1 minute of using this property, the javelin falls harmlessly back to the ground in a random location within 120 feet of you.
