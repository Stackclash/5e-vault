# Headhunter's Bullseye Lantern
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Headhunters-Bullseye-Lantern.webp#right)  


This bullseye lantern magically creates its own light, which is always a brilliant red. It emits bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While holding the lantern, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to release an intense burst of light from the lantern's lens. Each hostile creature within the lantern's bright light must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be marked for 1 minute. For the duration, marked creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. Marked creatures can't benefit from being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], and any attack roll made with disadvantage against a marked creature is made normally instead, provided that the attacker can see it. You choose the direction of the light when you use this property, which can't be used again until the next dawn.
