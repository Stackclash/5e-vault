# Mage Arrow
*Ammunition ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Arrow.md\|arrow]]), uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Mage-Arrow.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

When you fire this arrow from a bow at a target within its normal range, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow immediately splinters apart into `dice:1d4+4|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 4`) darts of magical force, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]] spell. The darts all strike the target of the attack. The arrow is then destroyed, before it reaches a target.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as mage bolts meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
