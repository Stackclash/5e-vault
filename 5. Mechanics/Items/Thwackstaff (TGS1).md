This festive quarterstaff is decorated with ribbons and other glittering elements. It is perfectly balanced and seems to be made to perform with. This magic quarterstaff has the finesse property and grants you a +1 bonus to Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) checks you make in order to put on an entertaining performance using the quarterstaff.

## Punishing Parry

This quarterstaff has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding this quarterstaff, you can expend 1 of its charges as a reaction when a creature that you can see hits you with a melee attack. When you do, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). You gain a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled against that attack, potentially causing it to miss you. If the attack misses you as a result of this bonus to AC, you can immediately make one attack with the quarterstaff against the attacking creature as part of your reaction. If you hit, the attack does extra damage equal to the number rolled on the d6.
