# Wand of Shadows
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wand-of-Shadows.webp#right)  


This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand evaporates into black mist and is destroyed.

## Shadow Claw

As an action, you can expend 1 charge to summon a shadowy claw to crush a target that you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage. The necrotic damage is increased to `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) if either you or the target are in dim light or darkness, and `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) if both you and the target are in dim light or darkness.

## Shadow Sneak

As a bonus action, you can expend 2 of the wand's charges to teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is in dim light or darkness. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge to teleport to the same space as the shadow from the wand's Split Shadow property, provided that you can see it within 120 feet of you.

## Split Shadow

As an action, you can expend 1 charge to remove your shadow from yourself. The shadow then appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of you, which uses the statistics for a shadow. The shadow is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys your mental commands (no action required by you) and acts on your initiative, but takes its turn immediately after you. It remains for 10 minutes, and it vanishes early if it's reduced to 0 hit points or if it's ever in your space. If the shadow remains for the full duration or if it's reduced to 0 hit points, this property of the wand can't be used again until the next dusk. A humanoid that dies from the shadow's Strength Drain does not create a new shadow.
