# Censer Chime
*Wondrous item, minor*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Censer-Chime.webp#right)  


This tiny, handheld bell produces a sweet chime when rung. A pinch of fine incense worth at least 1 gp can be placed inside the bell's clapper, which magically burns when you use an action to ring it, consuming the incense. You can use an action to refill the clapper with another pinch of incense. Both the bell and clapper have a series of small holes that allow the incense to burn, allowing the magical smell to fill the surrounding area. Any undead within range of the bell that can hear it when it's rung must make a Constitution saving throw. The range, saving throw DC, and other cumulative effects are determined by the bell's rarity. On a failed save, the creature is turned from the bell until the end of its next turn and subjected to the bell's cumulative effects (if any). While turned, it can't move any closer to the bell, and must spend its action on its next turn cowering and clutching its ears and nose (if it has them), as the smoke and chime magically overwhelm its senses.

Once a creature fails this saving throw, it automatically succeeds on subsequent saving throws against the effect for the next 24 hours.

| Rarity | Range | Save DC | Cumulative Effects |
|--------|-------|---------|--------------------|
| Uncommon | 15 ft. | 13 | Not Applicable |
| Rare | 20 ft. | 15 | If the creature is on the Ethereal Plane, it returns to the Material Plane for the duration. |
| Very rare | 25 ft. | 16 | If the creature's challenge rating is 1/2 or lower, it's destroyed. |
| Legendary | 30 ft. | 17 | The creature is turned for 1 minute (instead of the normal duration) or until it takes any damage. |
