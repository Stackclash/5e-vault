# Fulminating Treatise
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/fulminating-treatise.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contingency.md\|contingency]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gust Of Wind.md\|gust of wind]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Leomunds Tiny Hut.md\|Leomund's tiny hut]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Thunderwave.md\|thunderwave]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Force.md\|wall of force]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.  
- When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) force damage to the creature and knock the creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] if it is Large or smaller.
