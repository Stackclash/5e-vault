# Yeti Brush
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

Tufted white grass, yeti brush is incredibly easy to miss among the sheets of snow through which it grows. Indeed, the very fact that yeti brush can manage to break through layers of ice and sleet to reach the sun is owed to a ridge-like adaptation on its stalks to slide through snow like a blade through flesh. Arctic communities have long since learned to wrap their shoes and gloves in this grass to aid their travels through deep snow.

## Effect:

You may spend 1 minute wrapping your hands and feet in this grass. If you do so, you suffer no penalty to your movement speed when moving through snowy or icy terrain, and you have advantage on climbing surfaces covered in ice or snow.
