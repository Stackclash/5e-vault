# Silver Lycan Chime
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Silver-Lycan-Chime.webp#right)  


This small silver bell exudes divination magic, especially while under a full moon. When hung, the bell rings a unique, magical melody if a shapechanger passes no more than 15 feet underneath it. Different kinds of shapechangers cause the bell to emit a different sound. The melody is quiet but is nevertheless audible out to 100 feet.

Under a full moon, the range of the bell's magic changes. During a full moon, any shapechanger within 60 feet of the bell causes it to play its melody.
