# Godsteel Wargauntlets
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Godsteel-Wargauntlets.webp#right)  


These golden gauntlets carry a powerful force within them. The gauntlets have 10 charges. While wearing the gauntlets, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and any target you hit with an unarmed strike or damage-dealing spell with a range of touch takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) force damage. When you deal this bonus force damage, you can choose to expend up to 5 of the gauntlets' charges, dealing an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage to the target for each expended charge.

The gauntlets regain all expended charges daily at dawn. If you're attuned to one or more other magic items with "godsteel" in the name, you don't need to be attuned to these gauntlets in order to use them.
