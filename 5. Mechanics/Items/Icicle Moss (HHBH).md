# Icicle Moss
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

In areas of permafrost, the icicles last so long that they become able to support the growth of plant life that feeds on microbes and algae trapped within. One such breed of plant is known as icicle moss and can be found by the steely-grey patches that it creates on the icicles it grows on. Because of its adaptation, the moss constantly exudes an aura of cold, and when it is used to coat a weapon, it can share the bite of winter with those it strikes.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A weapon that has had this herb applied to it is considered magical and deals an additional `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold damage upon its first successful hit in a turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
