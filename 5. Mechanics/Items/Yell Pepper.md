# Yell Pepper
*Herb, common, Herb*

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

While many chillis can cause a shortness of breath, the yell pepper actually has the opposite effect: increasing lung capacity and aiding breath control. As many have found (most likely including whoever named this herb), this results in the rather droll ability to dramatically increase the volume of one's voice. That said, the next sounds the eater is most likely to make are pained screams, since this herb is also known for being incredibly spicy.

## Effect:

You may eat this herb as an action. For the next hour, the maximum volume of your voice increases, causing you to be able to shout as loud as a thunderclap.
