# Crown of the Eternal Bolt
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing and attuned to this item, you have resistance to lightning damage. This crown also has 6 charges. As an action, you may spend a charge to use any of the following abilities:

## Lightning Bolt

You may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lightning Bolt.md\|lightning bolt]] spell using the crown. You may spend additional charges to cast this spell at a higher level, spending one extra charge per level. This spell uses your spell save DC. If you do not have one, it is set to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.

## Electrical Resuscitation

As part of the action to do this ability, you must touch an adjacent [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] or dead creature, releasing a jolt of electricity from your hands as you do so. If the creature was [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]], you cause that creature to immediately wake up, also restoring them to 1 hit point if they had less than that at the time. If you touch a creature that died within the last minute, you immediately restore them to life with 1 hit point, however, you cannot restore missing body parts with this ability.

## Volt Shield

You cover yourself in a pulsing blue electrical current that harms other creatures that come into contact with it. Until the start of your next turn, you have immunity to lightning damage, and any creature that touches you suffers `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) lightning damage, or double that if they are wearing metal armor or covered in water. A creature can only suffer this damage once per turn.

## Lightning Strike

As part of the action used to do this ability, you must make a weapon attack against one creature within range. If your attack is successful, you deal an additional `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) lightning damage and they must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the start of your next turn.

This crown regains 1 charge per 20 lightning damage you take in a single turn while wearing it. It also recovers all expended charges at dawn.
