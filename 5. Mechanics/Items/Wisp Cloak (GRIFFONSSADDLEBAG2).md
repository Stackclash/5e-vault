- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This near-weightless cloak billows softly even without wind. While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on death saving throws and can move normally through the space of any Medium or smaller creature once on each of your turns, but can't stop there.

## Curse

This cloak is cursed by the spirit of a person who was betrayed by a close friend. Once you wear this cursed cloak, you can't remove it unless you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While wearing the cloak, whenever you move or end your turn within 10 feet of a friendly creature with 0 hit points for the first time on each of your turns, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer a failed death saving throw.
