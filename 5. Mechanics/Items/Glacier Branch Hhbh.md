# Glacier Branch
*Herb, rare, Herb*

## Description:

While at first this may seem like an ordinary branch covered by frost, closer inspection will reveal that the wood itself has actually transmuted into a form of living ice. This extraordinary transformation occurs when a tree is beset by extreme colds of magical origin, such as a wizard's duel or the breath of a white dragon. While most trees simply snap freeze as one would expect, on a rare occasion, certain branches will absorb this magic and become a glacier branch. While they are beautiful in and of themselves, it is their slushy-like sap that is the true wonder, as it contains a marvellous ability to instantly expand and solidify into solid ice once it has been exposed to air. This ability has been used to create makeshift dwellings when out in the unforgiving arctic winds, or even when in the midst of a battle to create an impromptu barricade.

## Effect:

The magical sap contained within this branch expands and hardens quickly after exposure to air, transforming into solid ice. As an action, you may break the tip of this branch and release this sap, creating up to 20 square feet of ice at least 1 foot thick at all points. You may configure this ice structure in any way you wish, but it must be contiguous throughout and be on points reachable by you during your turn. Once created, this ice acts as ordinary ice and will melt at the appropriate temperature. The structure can also be brokenâ€”it has 12 AC, 30 hit points, is vulnerable to fire damage and is immune to psychic and poison damage.
