# Myceliaweave Armor
*Cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Myceliaweave-Armor.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This naturally-sourced armor is interwoven with fibers and caps from a resilient strain of violet fungus that grows when exposed to rejuvenating magic. While wearing this armor, your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and whenever a spell or magical effect causes you to regain hit points, you also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the number of hit points you recover, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. While you have temporary hit points in this way, you also have resistance to necrotic damage.

## Curse

Once you don and attune to this magic armor, you can't doff it unless you die or are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell: a side effect of the violet fungus' magical and parasitic effects. When your attunement to the armor ends, your Constitution score is reduced by 2 (to a minimum score of 1) until `dice:2d6+6|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 6`) days have passed or until you attune to the armor again.
