^appearance-mephit

You can use an action to throw a marble into an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. On impact, the marble is destroyed, and a mephit appears in the space. The type of mephit depends on the marble you threw. The summoned mephit is friendly to you and your companions. It shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The mephit remains for 10 minutes or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. If you throw another marble while a summoned mephit remains, there is a 50 percent chance that the new mephit is hostile to you and doesn't obey your commands.
