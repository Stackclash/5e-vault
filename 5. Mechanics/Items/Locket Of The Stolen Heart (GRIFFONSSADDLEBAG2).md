# Locket of the Stolen Heart
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Locket-of-the-Stolen-Heart.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

The portrait inside this tiny golden locket transforms to depict the creature you love most (living or dead) once you attune to it. The love can be familial, romantic, or otherwise devotional. If your feelings change and you fall in love with a different creature while wearing the locket, the portrait transforms again to reflect your current feelings. While wearing the locket, you're immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]].

## Curse

This locket is cursed, and if the creature you love most is dead while you're attuned to it, the curse is extended to you. Even if the attunement ends or the target of your love changes, the curse remains. While cursed, your dreams are riddled with forlorn whispers and memories from your lost love. If you die while cursed in this way, you must also make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw whenever you're targeted by a spell or other effect that returns you to life. On a failed save, your soul is lost forever as it joins the soul of your lost love.

You remain cursed until you're targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, if the creature you love is restored to life, or if a creature casts the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dream.md\|dream]] spell and enters your dreams to dissolve the locket's illusions.
