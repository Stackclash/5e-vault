# Hat of the Nimbus Mage
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Hat-of-the-Nimbus-Mage.webp#right)  


This twin-peaked wizard hat has thin, wispy clouds circling its mountainous spires. You can mentally command the clouds to look like different weather using an action.

The hat has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you spend at least 1 hour in a naturally occurring fog bank, the hat regains all expended charges at the next dawn instead.

## Spells

While wearing the hat, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it, using the typical casting time for each spell when you do: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gaseous Form.md\|gaseous form]] (3 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Misty Step.md\|misty step]] (2 charges; you appear as a swiftly traveling patch of fog). Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges from the hat to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]] spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell; you can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

## Neutralize Weather

While wearing the hat, you can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to return any naturally occurring inclement weather within a 1-mile radius, centered on you, to a neutral state. The neutral weather can be clear or with light clouds, cool or warm, and with either a calm or moderate wind. After 8 hours, the weather returns to its previous state, unless the GM rules otherwise. You must be outside to use this property of the hat.
