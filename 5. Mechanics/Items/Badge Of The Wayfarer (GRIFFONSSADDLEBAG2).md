# Badge of the Wayfarer
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Badge-of-the-Wayfarer.webp#right)  


This badge is formed in the shape of a maple leaf with an embossed porcelain mug. While wearing the badge, you can recite its command phrase over the course of 1 minute to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md\|plane shift]] spell using the badge. When cast in this way, the spell's destination can only be the Wayfarer's Respite on the Astral Plane, an inn and pub of legend that drifts throughout the astral sea. The inn has no doors leading outside and can only be entered using the badge. Inside, the Wayfarer's Respite is large, comfortable, and decadent. It's frequently busy, despite its exclusivity, but always seems to have enough room and beds available for the wayward band of adventurers. The inn is expensive and suited for an aristocratic lifestyle, but is known to be willing to barter or trade for treasure, information, and favors.

Any creature that teleports to the inn is magically transported with their belongings back to their original location after 24 hours. You can use the badge to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md\|plane shift]] spell again in this way to return to your original location early. Once you return from the Wayfarer's Respite, the badge can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The badge's command phrase and purpose is a closely-kept secret. While casting [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] on the badge only reveals the fact that the badge is magical, a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Legend Lore.md\|legend lore]] spell reveals the badge's command phrase and properties.
