# Speed Apple
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

Despite their name and appearance, these electric-blue, fist-sized fruits are not actually related to apples. It contains a special chemical concoction that boosts the metabolic rate of animals that eat it and grants them a burst of speed and agility. The current theory from botanists is that this trait was developed to encourage its eaters to travel far and spread their seeds as widely as possible, especially since the fruit so rarely blooms. Many cultures once cultivated these precious fruits and handed them out to their greatest warriors tobe used only in the most pivotal of battles.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after you apply this herb, your walk speed increases by 10 feet and you ignore the effects of difficult terrain.
