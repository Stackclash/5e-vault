# Appraiser's Eye
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a creature missing an eye)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Appraisers-Eye.webp#right)  


This golden sphere is the size of an eyeball with a bejeweled iris. Its weight is negligible. The sphere has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. Even if you aren't attuned to the sphere, you can use it and its charges for the following properties.

While holding the eye, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell from it. Alternatively, you can use the eye as the material component required for the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Legend Lore.md\|legend lore]] spell. When you do, there is only a cumulative 10 percent chance that the sphere is consumed by the spell.

While you're attuned to the sphere, it also functions like a normal eye while it's in your socket, and you have advantage on Intelligence checks you make to determine an item's value, as well as on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight. In addition, if you cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Legend Lore.md\|legend lore]] and use the sphere as the material component for the spell while you're attuned to it, the 10 percent chance that the sphere is consumed by the spell isn't cumulative, and in the event that the sphere is consumed by the spell, it loses this property and can no longer be used as a component for the spell, but isn't destroyed.
