# Shadow Ward
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shadow-Ward.webp#right)  


This eerily still cloak seems to absorb some of the light that touches it. While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks. In addition, the cloak has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dusk. When you're hit by an attack, you can use a reaction to expend 1 of the cloak's charges to halve the damage you take from the attack and teleport in a plume of black smoke to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.
