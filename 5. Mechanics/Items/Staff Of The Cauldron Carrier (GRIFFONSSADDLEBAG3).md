This iron and brass staff holds a cauldron at its end. Despite its materials, it only weighs as much as a normal staff. While you're attuned to it, you gain a +1 bonus to any ability check using alchemy supplies, [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cooks Utensils.md\|cook's utensils]], or an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Herbalism Kit.md\|herbalism kit]].

## Spells

The staff has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Burning Hands.md\|burning hands]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Food And Water.md\|create food and water]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Poison And Disease.md\|detect poison and disease]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Heat Met(AL).md\|heat metal]] (2 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Purify Food And Drink.md\|purify food and drink]] (1 charge). This version of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Food And Water.md\|create food and water]] spell grants `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) temporary hit points to any creature that consumes a meal that it creates. The food created by the spell is delicious.
