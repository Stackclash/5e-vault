# Needlecloud Cactus
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

Despite its name, this plant is in fact not a cactus, but is more related to the stinging nettle, albeit taken to a rather extreme degree. This rather insidious plant possesses rather unimpressive vegetation above the surface, but it is its bulbous root system that has its most interesting adaptation. If a creature attempts to forage on the surface leaves, it will trigger a reaction from the root system that releases a cloud of needles that embed themselves in the face of the hapless animal. While this protects the plant, it actually also acts as part of the plant's reproductive cycle, as the needles are tipped with seeds that the scared animal will inevitably spread in its mad attempt to escape their painful meal.

## Effect:

As part of preparing this herb, you place segments of this herb in strategic places around your clothes and armour. Anytime to you are hit by a melee weapon attack, you may use your reaction to release a spray of sharp needles from the herbs on your body, forcing all creatures within 5 feet of you to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage on a failure, or half that on a success. Once you have used this ability 4 times, this herb runs out of needles and becomes useless.
