A hefty blowgun used by the inhabitants of the Murk: a series of deadly swamps whose waters are polluted with an uncanny poison. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic blowgun, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) poison damage. When you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with the blowgun, the target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5.
