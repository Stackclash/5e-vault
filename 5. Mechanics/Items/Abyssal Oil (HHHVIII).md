# Abyssal Oil
*Oil, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This green, viscous oil carries within it all of the rage and power of the Demon Lords of the Abyss. The oil can coat one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical, and any critical hit made with that item deals an extra `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) damage. This damage is not doubled.
