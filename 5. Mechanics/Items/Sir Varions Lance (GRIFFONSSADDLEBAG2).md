# Sir Varion's Lance
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance.md\|lance]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Sir-Varions-Lance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 P
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Special%20Weapons\|special]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This weighty lance was originally designed for Sir Varion, a brave knight with a famous disregard for horses. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has the heavy property, but is uniquely balanced to function well in close-quarters combat. Attacking a target within 5 feet of you with this weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

If you are attuned to [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sir Varions Shield (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Sir Varion's shield]], you can wield this weapon with one hand, instead of two, while also holding the shield.
