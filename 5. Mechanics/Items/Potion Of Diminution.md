# Potion of Diminution
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|enlarge/reduce]] spell for `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) hours (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#concentration\|concentration]] required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
