# Form of Order
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Longsword.md\|longsword]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Form-of-Order.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The whirring of countless gears can be heard faintly from within this weapon's brass fixtures. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and if your AC is an odd number without the sword, you also gain a +1 bonus to AC while you're attuned to it. AC bonuses from a spell or other temporary magical effect don't affect the bonus given by the sword.

## Equalize

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature makes the roll without advantage or disadvantage. A willing creature can choose to fail this saving throw.

## Field of Predictability

You can use a bonus action to cause the blade to emit a field of predictability for 1 minute. The field is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] and remains centered on the weapon, affecting each creature within 20 feet of it. For the duration, the first time that a creature within the field makes an attack roll or ability check on its turn, it must also make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) is treated as a 10. A willing creature can choose to fail this saving throw, but must choose to do so before rolling the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Sentience

The form of order is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can understand all languages and can communicate with the creature attuned to it telepathically while being held. However, it rarely feels the need to, and normally only communicates when prompted.

## Personality

The form of order has an unwaveringly logical personality and is devoid of emotion. Its only directive is to uphold order in the universe, and urges the attuned creature to do what it must to preserve order. If it feels that its attuned creature will not follow that ideal, a conflict may arise.
