# Xorn Eye Coin
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Xorn-Eye-Coin.webp#right)  


This clay coin bears a sculpted xorn eye at its center, and is usually found in a small leaden box. While holding the coin, you can use an action to speak its command word to animate the eye. The eye remains animated for 10 minutes. For the duration, the eye swivels to face the nearest gem or piece of precious metal within 60 feet of it that's worth 10 gp or more, provided the object isn't being worn or carried. This effect can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
