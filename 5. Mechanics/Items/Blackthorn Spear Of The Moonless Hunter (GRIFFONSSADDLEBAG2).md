This spiny, black bone spear is a favorite among nocturnal hunting tribes. While attuned to the spear, you can always see the faint outline of it, even in total darkness. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This spear contains a fragment of the moonless hunter, an ancient spirit that can be channeled to assume some of its powers. While holding the spear, you can use a bonus action to call forth and assume the spirit of the moonless hunter. While assuming the spirit, your eyes become pure white, and you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the effects of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]].  
- You can't sleep or be put to sleep by magical means, and you can't take or benefit from finishing a long rest.  
- You have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks.  
- You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, out to a range of 60 feet.  
- You can use a bonus action to cause the spear to fly back to your empty hand or land at your feet (your choice), provided that the spear is within 60 feet of you.  
- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.  

You can assume the spirit in this way for up to 8 hours. The effect ends early if you release the spirit as a bonus action or if you're farther than 60 feet away from the spear for more than 1 minute. The spirit returns to the spear when you are no longer assuming it, at which point you gain 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] for every 2 hours you assumed the spirit (minimum 1 level). [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|Exhaustion]] gained in this way can only be reduced by finishing a long rest.
