# Peacekeeper's Lily
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

Pure white and radiant, these lilies are most easily identifiable by the smooth, olive-sized bulbs that form in the middle of the lily flower. When pressed into an oil and applied to a weapon, these bulbs have a calmative effect that can turn even the most violent berserker into a diehard pacifist.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to any piercing or slashing melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of piercing or slashing ammunition. For the next hour, anytime you damage a creature with that weapon or piece of ammunition, that creature must succeed on a DC 15Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] until the start of your next turn. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever they attempt to perform an action that would directly lead to another creature taking damage. If they fail, they must choose another action that would not directly lead to another creature taking damage or waste their action.
