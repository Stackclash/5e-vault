# Butcher
*Melee Weapon, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: Martial
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

It is commonly believed that the three-headed flail known as the Butcher was originally crafted by Yeenoghu himself from the thigh bone and skin of a god he slew himself. Whether that is true or simply one of his own self-aggrandizements is up for debate, but what cannot be contested is the strength of the flail itself. With each head capable of delivering both physical and magical devastation that lingers in both the flesh and the mind, it is Yeenoghu's weapon of choice whenever he decides to destroy something with a little more finesse than his teeth and claws will allow.

When you attune to this weapon, your appearance becomes more bestial, growing fur along your limbs and developing a hunch in your posture. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. In addition, whenever you successfully hit a creature with this weapon, you may make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Shove\|Shove]] or Push ^[Potentially the Pushing Attack Maneuver?] attack against them as a free action. You may only do this once per turn.

## Random Properties

Angdrelve has the following randomly determined properties:

- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial]] properties  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Beneficial Properties.md\|minor beneficial]] property  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  

## Triple Threat

When you successfully hit a creature with this weapon, you may choose one of the following additional effects:

- The attack deals an extra `dice: 2d12|avg|noform` (`2d12`) bludgeoning damage.  
- The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] until the start of your next turn.  
- The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell until the start of your next turn. You may only use this feature once per turn.  

## Savage Stampede

While holding this weapon, you may use your bonus action to take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action. If you do so, up to 4 creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you may use their reactions to also move up to their speed in the same direction that you are moving.

## Master of the Hunt

If you are also wearing and attuned to the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Armor Of The Gnoll Lord.md\|Armor of the Gnoll Lord]], you may use your action to throw this weapon down in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and make it fight on your behalf. This weapon acts directly after you on the initiative order and fights using your Strength modifier and proficiencies to calculate attack and damage bonuses. On its turn, it may fly up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and make up to three attacks against adjacent targets. If this weapon is targeted by any effect, you are considered to be holding it. It drops to the ground if you die or if you end this effect on your turn (no action required).

## Curse

As the weapon of a Demon Lord, The Butcher bares a lingering curse for any mortal that attunes to it. Whenever you kill a creature made of flesh while cursed by this item, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you become obsessed with consuming some of that creature's body. While obsessed in this way, you must use your action to consume a mouthful of that creature's body, after which, this obsession ends. If you are unable to use your action to do this for whatever reason, your obsession overcomes your senses, and your action is wasted. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to The Butcher and end the urge immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current urge. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must make the saving throw after your next long rest as usual.

## Destroying the Butcher

The only way to destroy the Butcher is to feed it to a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Zaratan.md\|zaratan]] and allow it to be digested for 100 years inside its cavernous belly. After this, the weapon crumbles into dust and becomes useless.
