# Scroll of the New Dawn
*Scroll, minor, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scroll-of-the-New-Dawn.webp#right)  


This narrow parchment always feels sun-warmed to the touch and gives off a faint glow. Reading the scroll aloud takes 1 minute, at which point the words on the scroll fade and it bursts into an instantaneous flash of sunlight. The scroll is then destroyed. If the reading is interrupted, the scroll is not destroyed.

When the scroll bursts into sunlight, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Any magic item within the bright light that would normally regain a number of expended charges at dawn instantly regains all expended charges. When this happens, a creature that's attuned to an item in the light that regains 1 or more charges takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) radiant damage for each charge regained by the item in this way, even if the creature isn't in the bright light. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. Legendary items and artifacts are unaffected by the light.
