# Architect's Disdain
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/War Pick.md\|war pick]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Architects-Disdain.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This adamantine war pick is specially designed to tear down walls. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever the war pick hits an object or structure, the hit is a critical hit. In addition, if you hit a magically created object or structure, such as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Ice.md\|wall of ice]], with the war pick, you can choose to dispel the wall or object as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] spell (6th-level version). The effect fails if the spell or magical effect that created the object or structure was cast using a 7th-level spell slot or higher. Once the war pick has dispelled a structure in this way, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
