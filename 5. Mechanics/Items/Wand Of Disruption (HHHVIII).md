# Wand of Disruption
*Wand, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This wand has 4 charges. As an action, you may expend 1 charge to force a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target creature suffers `dice:6d10|noform|avg` (`6d10`) necrotic damage, and any magical effect currently affecting them is suppressed until the end of their next turn as if they were under the effect of an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Antimagic Field.md\|antimagic field]] spell.

The wand recovers `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
