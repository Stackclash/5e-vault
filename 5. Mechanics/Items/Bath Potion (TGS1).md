# Bath potion
*Potion, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bath-Potion.webp#right)  


This bubbly potion is frothy and smells like lavender. When you drink this potion, any dirt and grime on your body is magically rinsed away. Further, your breath, hair, and nails are suddenly cleaned, looking either polished and pristine or smelling of daisies and honey for the next 24 hours. Bubbles occasionally escape from your mouth while the potion is in effect.
