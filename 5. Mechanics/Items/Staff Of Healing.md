This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cure Wounds.md\|cure wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] (2 charges). or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mass Cure Wounds.md\|mass cure wounds]] (5 charges).

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). On a 1. the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
