# Tormentor's Flail
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Flail.md\|flail]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Tormentors-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The head of this flail is in the shape of a metal skull that's pierced with large construction spikes. When you hit a creature that's missing any of its hit points with this magic weapon, the creature takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage.

In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of your next turn.
