# Fire Fire!
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Light Crossbow.md\|light crossbow]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Fire-Fire.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 piercing
- **Range**: 80/320
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Loading\|Loading]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

This hollow metal crossbow was created by a team of [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Kobold.md\|kobolds]] and contains an enchanted ember at its core. The crossbow has 3 charges. While the crossbow has at least 1 charge, the inner ember burns brightly when you hold the weapon. While it burns, the crossbow emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, and any nonmagical bolt fired from the crossbow catches fire and deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage to any target it hits.

You can expend 1 of the crossbow's charges as an action to cause the ember to spew forth devastating flames, sending out a wave of fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

The crossbow regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the magical ember inside the crossbow dies, and the weapon becomes a nonmagical crossbow.
