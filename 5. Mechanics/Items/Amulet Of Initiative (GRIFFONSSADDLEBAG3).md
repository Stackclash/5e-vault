# Amulet of Initiative
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Amulet-of-Initiative.webp#right)  


This amulet is actually a small gong-like bell. It emits a loud ring whenever you roll initiative, which is audible out to a range of 100 feet. You have advantage on initiative rolls while wearing the amulet. Further, your speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your second turn of combat, and you gain the following special reaction:

## Knockout Parry

The first time you're hit with an attack before the start of your second turn of each combat, you can use your reaction to immediately make a single weapon attack against the attacker. This reaction can be used even if you're [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Surprised\|surprised]], and allows you to draw a stowed weapon as part of it. If the total of your attack roll is equal to or lower than the attacker's, the triggering attack hits you, and yours misses; if yours is higher, the triggering attack misses you, and you hit the attacker instead. If you hit it with a melee attack, the attack deals an extra damage die of the weapon's type, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of your next turn.
