# Tooth Capsule

- **Cost**: 100 gp

A tooth capsule is a false tooth, or a cap that fits over a tooth, that contains a dose of a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Pill Form (KPDM).md\|potion in pill form]]. (The pill loaded into a tooth capsule can't be changed.) To activate the tooth capsule, you simply bite down on it as a bonus action and make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the capsule shatters and releases the pill, which you can then swallow, hold in your mouth, or spit out.

Determining whether a tooth in someone else's mouth is a tooth capsule takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Medicine\|Medicine]]) check. Obviously, the creature must be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], or cooperative in order for the tooth to be examined. Tooth capsules containing poison are often used by spies and operatives of fanatical organizations who are willing to die rather than allow their secrets to be captured by their enemies.

Tooth capsules are usually priced at 100 gp plus the cost of whatever potion they're loaded with. The use of poison or other harmful potions in a tooth capsule is illegal in some places, and the black market price for one in such a place might be much higher.
