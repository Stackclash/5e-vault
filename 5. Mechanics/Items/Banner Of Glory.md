# Banner of Glory
*Wondrous Item, very rare*  


While holding the banner, you can use an action to wave it heroically to inspire willing creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you. An affected creature immediately gains the benefits of a short rest. Once used, the banner can't be used again for 24 hours.
