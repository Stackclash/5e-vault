# Yeenoghu's Wrath
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Whip.md\|whip]]), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVII/YeenoghusWrath.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]

You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. As a bonus action, you may cause the stinger on the end of this whip to exude a noxious poison. The next creature you successfully hit with this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]]. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, the target is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used this ability cannot be used again until you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack.
