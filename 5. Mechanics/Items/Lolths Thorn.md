# Lolth's Thorn
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

Shining black like a spider's leg, these foot-long thorns grow on vines tangled in cobwebs left behind by giant cave spiders. The tips of these thorns are hollow, while the inside is filled with numerous spongy cells capable of absorbing large amounts of toxins; something that seems to actually nourish the vines they're attached to. These properties also make the thorn a natural syringe that is specially adapted for the removal (and subsequent redistribution) of poisons in the bloodstream. For this reason, the drow believe that these thorns are a gift from Lolth and only granted to those who are destined to spread her venom throughout her enemies.

## Effect:

This herb may be wielded like a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dagger.md\|dagger]]. If this thorn successfully hits a creature suffering from the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] condition, that condition ends immediately, and this thorn is filled with whichever poison that creature was afflicted by. Upon the next successful hit with this thorn, the hit creature suffers any of the effects imposed by the original poison; if that poison required a saving throw, the DC is set to 15. This thorn may only carry one poison at a time, and any poison inside is rendered useless 24 hours after it is first absorbed.
