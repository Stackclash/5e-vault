This old, withered hammer seemingly belongs in a swamp. Regardless of the conditions the hammer is kept in, it is always damp and smells of bog water. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This hammer has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 or more of the hammer's charges to slam it into the ground and transform the area around you into sickly, swamp-like terrain that lasts for 1 minute. When you do, choose a space within 5 feet of you. You create a swamp that fills that space and nearby spaces within 5 feet of it, turning the area into thick muck. This area is considered difficult terrain. For each additional charge expended after the first, the swamp's radius increases by 5 feet. While you're holding the hammer, you can traverse the magical swamp as if it were normal terrain.

If you expend the last charge from the hammer, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the hammer turns into viscous muck in your hands and is destroyed.
