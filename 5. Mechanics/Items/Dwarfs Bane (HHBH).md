# Dwarf's Bane
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A yellow, sponge-like fungus that many mistake for moss at first inspection. This herb tends to grow in noxious environments like forgotten mountain tunnels and uses its porous nature to absorb toxins and other harmful pollutants. As part of this, it works particularly well for rendering poisons harmless. Unfortunately, this trait also extends to alcohol, and many careless dwarven brewers have found casks of their ale ruined by this otherwise helpful herb.

## Effect:

When this herb is placed inside any poisonous liquid, all toxins are absorbed by the herb and that liquid becomes harmless and drinkable water. This effect extends to alcohol which is rendered non-alcoholic if subjected to this herb. This herb is capable of removing the toxins from up to 5 gallons of liquid, after which it is rendered useless.
