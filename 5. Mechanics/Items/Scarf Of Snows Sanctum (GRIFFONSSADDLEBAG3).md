# Scarf of Snow's Sanctum
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*

This scarf is incredibly warm and pinned together with a silvered snowflake brooch. While wearing this scarf, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Ice.md\|wall of ice]] spell from it (save DC 15). When you do, the ice wall creates a hemispherical dome around you in a 15-foot diameter, centered on your location. The wall remains for up to 1 hour, instead of 10 minutes, and any cold damage it deals is halved. When you create the dome, you can choose for the hemisphere to have a small entryway leading into it that a Medium creature can squeeze through. Once this property of the scarf has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
