# Sandtrap Palm
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 5 gp

## Description:

A palm with fronds which secrete a silica-phobic film that repels sand in order to mitigate damage during sandstorms. This incredibly useful feature, combined with the plant's ubiquitous nature has resulted in its leaves being used for everything from housing, to clothing, to specialised equipment designed to ease traversal through the shifting desert sands.

## Effect:

You may spend 1 minute wrapping or unwrapping your hands and feet in this herb. While your hands and feet are wrapped in this herb, you suffer no penalty to your movement speed when moving through sandy terrain, and you have advantage on climbing surfaces covered in sand.
