# Diirinka's Boon
*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While attuned to this item, you cannot be surprised in combat and you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks to spot hidden enemies.

When you become attuned to this item, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`) and look up the results on the Derro Madness table [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: in the derro statblock page]. Your roll indicates what madness you suffer from while attuned to this item. This madness cannot be cured in any way except by ending attunement to this item which ends this condition immediately.
