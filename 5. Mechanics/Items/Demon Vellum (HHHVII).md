This ashy grey vellum is crafted from the skin of a demon and is capable of summoning other demons when it is used to channel words of power. A wizard may choose to inscribe one of their known spells on this sheaf of vellum and insert it into their spellbook. If they do so, whenever they cast that spell, they may cast it as if they had cast it using the highest spell slot level their wizard level would grant them, regardless of the level of the spell slot they actually used.

However, whenever that spell is cast in this way, there is also a 10 percent chance that a demon will appear in an unoccupied space adjacent to the caster. This demon is chosen by the DM but must be of a Challenge Rating equal to or below the spell level that the triggering spell was cast at. This demon acts on its own initiative and is hostile to all non-demons around it but will prioritize attacking the caster if possible. The demon disappears after 1 minute, or if it drops to 0 hit points, whichever comes first.
