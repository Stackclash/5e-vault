# Inferno Rope
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Inferno-Rope.webp#right)  


This 10-foot long rope smells of sulfur and crackles with embers when moved. As an action, you can lay the rope down in a line next to you on solid ground and speak its command word to magically set it ablaze. When you do, the rope becomes a 15-foot tall wall of fire along its length. The flames are visible, but not opaque, and are 1 inch thick. Creatures within 5 feet of the flames when it's ignited must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) fire damage. A creature setting the rope ablaze automatically succeeds on this saving throw. The flames burn for 1 minute and cast bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for another 15 feet. A creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw when it crosses the line of fire for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there. On a failure, the creature takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) fire damage.

The rope rematerializes at the base of the flames after 1 minute. Once the rope has been lit, it can't be used again in this way until the next dawn. The rope can only be cut by magical means and becomes a nonmagical length of rope once cut.
