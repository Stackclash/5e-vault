# Sharpeye Twig
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

The brambly *optica ferala* bush is known for its scraggly appearance, being covered in sticks and thorns from every conceivable angle. However, among this throng of vegetation is an incredibly useful twig identified by its reddish colouration and distinct lack of thorns. When chewed upon, this twig releases a plethora of vasodilators that results in a clarity of the senses and steadying of extremities. Due to this, sharpshooters have taken to chewing on this herb in order to stabilise their aim when attempting long range shotsâ€”the fact that it also makes them look significantly cooler while doing so is simply an added bonus.

## Effect:

You may use your bonus action to start chewing this herb. While chewing this herb, you ignore any disadvantage imposed when attempting to make a ranged weapon attack beyond your weapon's normal range. This herb may be chewed for up to one minute, which may be done all at once, or in several smaller segments, using a minimum of one round each time before stopping (no action required).
