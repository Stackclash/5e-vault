# Potion of Winterbite
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, your physiology changes entirely and your blood becomes icy cold for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) hours. During this time, you are immune to cold damage, and any time a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, they suffer `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage. This potion is bright blue with frost constantly encasing the glass.
