# Potion of Invisibility
*Potion, minor, very rare*  


This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
