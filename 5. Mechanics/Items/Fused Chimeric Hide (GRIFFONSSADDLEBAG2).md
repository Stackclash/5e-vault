# Fused Chimeric Hide
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Hide Armor.md\|hide armor]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a barbarian or druid)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Fused-Chimeric-Hide.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 12.0 lbs.

This armor is made from the three unique hides of a fearsome chimera, creating an armor that's both imposing and practical. You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

In addition, when you enter a rage or use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast, you can take on a special aspect, choosing one of the options below.

## Aspect of the Dragon

Your skin hardens into platelike scales, granting you 20 temporary hit points and resistance to fire damage.

## Aspect of the Goat

You grow a pair of ram's horns. If you already have horns, this aspect causes them to grow larger and more powerful. When you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target no more than one size larger than you and immediately make a melee weapon attack against it, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

## Aspect of the Lion

You grow a shimmering mane that wreathes your head and neck, and your teeth become fangs. You have advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]].

Each aspect lasts for 1 minute. At the end of the duration, you revert to your normal form or beast shape. Once you take on the aspect of a creature in this way, you can't take on that aspect again until the next dawn.
