# Aged Goodberry Wine
*Potion, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Aged--Goodberry-Wine.webp#right)  


This bottle of thick red wine is miraculously made from magical goodberries and peonies using a closely kept family recipe. It tastes fruity and floral, with notes of honey and the feeling of a fresh breeze, and is deeply rejuvenating. The bottle comes with 8 servings of the syrupy potion, which each take 1 minute to drink.

When you drink this wine, you can regain hit points by spending any number of Hit Dice, as if you'd finished a short rest. You regain 1 extra hit point for each Hit Die you spend in this way. The wine provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. In addition, for the next hour, whenever you roll a Wisdom or Charisma ability check or saving throw, you add `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) to the total of the roll.
