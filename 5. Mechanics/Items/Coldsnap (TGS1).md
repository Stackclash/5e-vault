# Coldsnap
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Whip.md\|whip]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Coldsnap.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This icy whip deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) cold damage to any target it hits. In addition, you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The whip has 3 charges and regains all of them each day at dawn. When you hit a creature that is not immune to cold damage with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to force the creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn. On a success, its speed is halved instead.

Once you attune to this weapon, its normally frigid handle feels warm to the touch.
