# Game Changer's Eye
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a creature missing an eye)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Game-Changers-Eye.webp#right)  


This rubbery prosthetic eye has a dark polyhedral die at its center, as if it were a pupil. When found, the die has 20 sides. The following properties of the eye can be used even if you aren't attuned to it:

If you're missing an eye, you can use an action to place the prosthetic in the empty socket. While it's in your eye socket, it can't be removed unless you're willing, and you can see through it as if it were a normal eye.

You can use an action to speak the eye's command word to change the number of sides on the die at its center. The eye must be in your socket or hand in order to use this property.

Whether it's in your socket or your hand, you can shake the prosthetic to cause the die at its center to roll around and reveal a random number, allowing it to be used as part of a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Gaming Set.md\|gaming set]]. If you're attuned to the eye, you also have advantage on ability checks related to gaming sets that involve dice.

While you're attuned to the eye, the die at its center can be used to change elements of your fate, often to chaotic results. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw while the eye is in your socket, you can choose to reroll the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). You must use the new result. You make this decision after seeing the result of the initial roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Each time you use this property, there is a cumulative 50 percent chance that you can't use it again until the next dawn.

The eye releases a burst of chaotic magic each time you use it to reroll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). When it does, roll a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) and consult the table below to determine what additional effects occur. If an effect specifies a duration of a number of rounds, the effect ends at the start of your turn on the round that it would end.

`dice: [[Game Changers Eye (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^effect]]`

| dice: d10 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | You are confused for `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) rounds, as if you were affected by the confusion spell. |
| 2 | Each creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself) takes a â€“2 penalty to its AC for `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. |
| 3 | You transform into a stuffed toy resembling yourself for `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) rounds, during which time you are considered petrified. While petrified in this way, your weight decreases by a factor of 10, rather than increases. |
| 4 | You and every creature within 30 feet of you becomes vulnerable to bludgeoning damage for `dice:1d4\|noform\|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. |
| 5 | For the next day, your skin changes color every 30 minutes, cycling through the colors of the rainbow in order starting with red. |
| 6 | A random creature within 60 feet of you is affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fly.md\|fly]] spell for 1 minute, without requiring concentration. |
| 7 | You gain the use of an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Unseen Servant.md\|unseen servant]] for 1 hour. |
| 8 | You can breathe underwater for 24 hours. |
| 9 | Flowers and vines grow around you; for 1 minute, the ground within 15 feet of you is considered difficult terrain for hostile creatures. The effect remains centered on you and moves with you. |
| 10 | You can immediately take one additional action, interrupting the current turn if it's not already your turn. |
