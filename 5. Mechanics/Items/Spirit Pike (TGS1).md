If you're not proficient with pikes, you are nevertheless proficient with the spirit pike while you're attuned to it. When you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spiritual Weapon.md\|spiritual weapon]] spell, you can dissolve this weapon into the air and command the spell's spectral weapon to take the form of the spirit pike. Your spell attacks with this spectral weapon deal force damage equal to `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) + your spellcasting modifier instead of its normal damage. The spell's damage still increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) for every two slot levels you use to cast the spell above 2nd.

Your hands are left free while the pike is dissolved in this way. When the spell ends, the pike reappears in your hands or appears on the ground at your feet if your hands are full.

In addition, the weapon has 4 charges and regains all of them each day at dawn. When you hit a target with a weapon or spell attack using the pike as either a physical or spectral weapon, you can expend 1 charge to deal `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) radiant damage to the target in addition to the attack's damage.
