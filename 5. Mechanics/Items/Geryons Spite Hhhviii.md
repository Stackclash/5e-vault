You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon and any creature you hit must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 2d12|avg` (`2d12`) poison damage and become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] until it finishes a short or long rest. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the poison damage it takes. If its hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. This reduction lasts until the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] condition is removed.
