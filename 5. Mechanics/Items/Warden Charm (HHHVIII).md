# Warden Charm
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This stone charm contains the remains of an eidolon's spirit which does its best to protect whoever is wearing it. If a creature within 5 feet of you attempts to attack you while you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] and wearing this item, the spirit within the charm emerges to protect you, forcing the attacking creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacking creature suffers `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) force damage and is forced to pick a new target; wasting the attack if they fail to do so.
