# Scepter of Rot and Decay
*Melee Weapon, artifact, Crafted Artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

In one of the many doomsday prophecies thrown around by the demonology cultists, the main focus is on a single splinter that embeds itself in the World Tree. This mottled-grey splinter is topped with sickly, black fungus caps that spread noxious spores through the tree's systems, infecting it and starting a chain of events that will lead to the collapse of all life in the multiverse. This splinter is the Scepter of Rot and Decay, an artifact crafted from the stem of the Demon Lord [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Zuggtmoy.md\|Zuggtmoy]]. Many of her deranged cultists believe that this is her ultimate end goal; once she has built up her army of devoted fungus thralls, she will allow her body to be transformed into this scepter and then ultimately conquer all animal and plant life everywhere. We can only hope that this prophecy remains the simple deranged ranting of demon-afflicted madmen.

In order to attune to this item, you must bury yourself in a 1-foot thick layer of decaying vegetable matter for at least 8 hours while holding onto the scepter. Upon rising from this layer, your attunement finishes and your body takes on a more mottled appearance as small mushrooms grow across your body. When your attunement to this item ends, your body reverts to its original form.

In the hands of one who is attuned to it, this scepter can be used as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]] that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The scepter deals an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage on a hit.

## Random Properties

The Scepter of Rot and Decay has the following random properties:

- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial]] properties  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Beneficial Properties.md\|minor beneficial]] properties  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Detrimental Properties.md\|major detrimental]] property  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  

## Spellcasting

While holding this scepter, you may use it to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Locate Animals Or Plants.md\|locate animals or plants]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Sickness.md\|ray of sickness]] spells at will. In addition, you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ensnaring Strike.md\|ensnaring strike]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Entangle.md\|entangle]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plant Growth.md\|plant growth]] spells up to 3 times each. You regain all expended uses upon the next dawn.

## Infestation Spores

As an action, you release spores that burst out into a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius sphere centered on you, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#spores%20of%20Zuggtmoy\|spores of Zuggtmoy]] and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Zuggtmoy.md\|Madness of Zuggtmoy table]]* ^[See the info tab]) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a "spore servant" if it's a type of creature that can be "(see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual)". You may use this ability up to 3 times, regaining all expended uses upon the next dawn.

## Mind Control Spores

As an action, you release spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you, and it lingers for 1 minute. Humanoids and beasts in the cloud when it appears, or that enter it later, must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#influence%20of%20Zuggtmoy\|influence of Zuggtmoy]] for 24 hours. While infected in this way, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you and can't be reinfected by these spores. Once you use this ability once, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Infectious Sorcery

Poison damage that you deal to a creature while attuned to this staff ignores any immunity or resistance to poison damage that your target may have. In addition, poison damage that you deal to creatures [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you does not count for the sake of ending charm effects that end upon the target taking damage.

## Protective Thrall

Whenever you hit by an attack, you may use your reaction to force one creature within 5 feet of you that is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you to use its reaction and be hit by the attack instead.

## Exert Will

You may use your bonus action to cause one creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you that you can see to use its reaction and move up to its speed as you direct or to make a weapon attack against a target that you designate.

## Curse

When you become attuned to the scepter, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Zuggtmoy.md\|Madness of Zuggtmoy table]]* ^[See the info tab] table and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Scepter

The scepter can only be destroyed by planting it in the fabled Flaming Forest of Nessus, the lowest level of the Nine Hells. Once planted in the ground, the scepter will catch flame and wither away to ash, never to return.
