# Ring of Gestures
*Ring, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Gestures.webp#right)  


This gaudy ring has a delicately carved pink gem in the shape of a hand at its center. While wearing this ring, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Minor Illusion.md\|minor illusion]] cantrip at will to enlarge, reduce, and change the color of the hand wearing the ring or any of its fingers. In addition, whenever you make a gesture with the hand wearing this ring, the pink gemstone moves to mimic the gesture and remains that way until you make a new one.
