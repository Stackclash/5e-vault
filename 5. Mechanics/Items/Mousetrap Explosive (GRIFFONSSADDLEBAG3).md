# Mousetrap Explosive
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mousetrap-Explosive.webp#right)  


This fist-sized ball is made from two conjoined hemispheres. The hemispheres are lined with spinning treads, which are used in tandem to drive the ball forward or change directions.

You can use an action to wind the ball up by turning a mouse-shaped key on its side. You can turn the key up to 6 times using this action. You can then immediately place the ball on the ground at your feet and speak its command word. When you do, the ball's fuse-like tail sputters alight, and its treads begin to spin. The ball immediately moves 30 feet for each time you turned its key, up to 180 feet. When you wind up the ball, you choose the direction it takes for each 30-foot line it moves. It can change direction every 30 feet; if the ball hits an object, it spins in place against that object until it can change direction next.

At the end of the ball's movement, it explodes, destroying the ball and sending alchemical glue flying outward. The glue covers a 20-foot radius around it when it detonates, which doesn't travel around corners. A creature that enters a space that's covered in glue for the first time on its turn or that starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is stuck to the glue, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn, at which point it can repeat the saving throw. On a success, it breaks free from the glue, but must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves within the glued area.

If you wind the ball up but don't speak the command word, it must be wound up again before the next time you use it. The glue dissolves and vanishes after 1 minute.
