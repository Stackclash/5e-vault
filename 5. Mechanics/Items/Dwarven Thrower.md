You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) damage or, if the target is a giant, `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.
