This lashed-together stump and stick carry an age-old enchantment from an unknown source. Over time, the strength of the magic has faded, but this heirloom of a weapon has remained in caring hands all the while. Creatures hit with this magic weapon take an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) poison damage. If the creature is fey, you deal maximum poison damage instead of rolling.
