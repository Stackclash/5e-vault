# Glove of the Grim Fandango
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Glove-of-the-Grim-Fandango.webp#right)  


You are proficient with all musical instruments while you wear this glove on your dominant hand. In addition, spectral musicians appear behind you to accompany your playing when you play an instrument for at least 1 minute. The musicians are obviously illusory and vanish after you stop playing for 1 minute. While accompanied by the spectral musicians, you have advantage on any Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) check you make.

In addition, your spell save DC for enchantment spells you cast while performing with the spectral musicians increases by 2 when the affected creature or creatures are listening to your performance.
