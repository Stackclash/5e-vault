# Shellguard Armor
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Breastplate.md\|breastplate]]), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Shellguard-Armor.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

The front of this armor is adorned with a large shell design, which covers your chest. The metal has a pearlescent shimmer. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, you can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

The armor has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you're within 100 feet of a natural body of sea water at that time, it regains all expended charges instead. While wearing the armor, you can use your reaction when you take fire damage to expend 1 of the armor's charges to halve the fire damage you take from the triggering effect.
