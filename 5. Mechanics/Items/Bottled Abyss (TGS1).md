# Bottled Abyss
*Potion, minor, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bottled-Abyss.webp#right)  


This small vial has a single dose of a fuming, pitch-black poison inside of it. When a creature eats or drinks the poison, it takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage and must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blind]] and unable to sleep. When an affected creature attempts to rest, their dreams are plagued with terrible nightmares, preventing them from benefiting from a long rest. The creature can reattempt the saving throw once every 24 hours.

The poison lasts until the affected creature succeeds on a saving throw or is cured by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/He(AL).md\|heal]], or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell.
