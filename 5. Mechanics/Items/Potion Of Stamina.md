# Potion of Stamina
*Potion, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you gain a sense of inner strength and vitality. For the next 24 hours, whenever you roll a saving throw to resist an effect that causes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]], you may make that roll at advantage. This potion is a bright blue with what looks like electricity running through it occasionally.
