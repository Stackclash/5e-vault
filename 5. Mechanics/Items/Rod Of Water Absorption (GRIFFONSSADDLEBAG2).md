# Rod of Water Absorption
*Rod, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Rod-of-Water-Absorption.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This hollow rod has a hole at its end and four sections that each magically hold up to 10 gallons of water. Each hollow section is capped with a ring of glass, allowing you to see inside the rod and know how much water is stored within it. The rod weighs 3 pounds, regardless of how much water is stored inside.

While holding the open end of the rod underwater, you can speak its first command word as an action to cause it to begin absorbing water for the next minute. The rod can only absorb water. If the rod is submerged in this way for the full duration, it absorbs 10 gallons of water. The rod can hold up to 40 gallons at any time in this way, and can absorb up to 100 each day.

While holding the rod, you can use an action to speak its second or third command words. When you speak the second command word, you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Or Destroy Water.md\|create or destroy water]] spell (Create Water only) from the rod. You can cast the spell at up to 4th level in this way. Each gallon of water you create as part of the spell is drawn from the pool of water within the rod. If you cast this spell from the rod and cause the water to fall as rain, the spell consumes 10 gallons of water for each of the spell's slot levels.

Speaking the third command word causes 10 or more gallons of water to erupt from the rod in a torrent of water, up to the maximum amount remaining within the rod. This water is drawn from the pool of water within the rod. The water is shot in a line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. Any creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 gallons of water used from the rod and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed.
