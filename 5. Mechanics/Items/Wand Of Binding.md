# Wand of Binding
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/wand-of-binding.jpg#right]]  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

## Spells

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Monster.md\|hold monster]] (5 charges) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Person.md\|hold person]] (2 charges).

## Assisted Escape

While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]], or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
