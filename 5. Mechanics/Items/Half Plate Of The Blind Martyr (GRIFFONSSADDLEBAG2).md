![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Half-Plate-of-the-Blind-Martyr.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 15 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

This dark, battle-scarred half plate armor honors the blind valkyrie, a twisted symbol of impartial war, justice, and repentance. You gain a +2 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

## Charges

This armor has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d4+4|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 4`) expended charges daily at midday. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC, spellcasting ability modifier, and spell attack bonus:

- 1 charge: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cure Wounds.md\|cure wounds]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|inflict wounds]]  
- 2 charges: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blindness Deafness.md\|blindness/deafness]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]]  
- 3 charges: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]]  
- 4 charges: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Banishment.md\|banishment]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Death Ward.md\|death ward]]  
- 5 charges: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contagion.md\|contagion]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mass Cure Wounds.md\|mass cure wounds]]  
- 6 charges: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Harm.md\|harm]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/He(AL).md\|heal]]  

## Curse

This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. This curse can only be removed by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell or similar magic, removing the armor fails to end the curse. While you're cursed, you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blind]], but have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] out to a range of 60 feet while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with an attack or cast a spell that affects a creature other than yourself, you take 3 psychic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity
