# Rat King Crown
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Rat-King-Crown.webp#right)  


This dark silver circlet is embossed with the heads and tails of many rats. While wearing it, ordinary rats, giant rats, and swarms of rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

In addition, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with rats, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Animals.md\|speak with animals]] spell.

## Mark of the Rat King

While you're attuned to one or more other items with "rat king" in its name, the crown gains the following additional property.

Whenever you roll initiative, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`). On a 5 or 6, a swarm of rats gathers at your location, provided that enough rats are within a half mile of you (as determined by the GM). The swarm is friendly to you and your companions. It remains with you until the combat ends or you die. If the swarm is reduced to half its hit point maximum or less, it scatters and leaves early.

The friendly swarm shares your initiative but takes its turn immediately after yours. On its turn, it attacks the nearest hostile creature within 30 feet of you. If there isn't a creature to attack, it shares your space and takes the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dodge\|Dodge]] action.

The swarm becomes hostile if you remove the crown or if you or your companions harm it.
