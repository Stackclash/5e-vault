# Ring of the Distant Digit
*Ring, common (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Ring-of-the-Distant-Digit.webp#right)  


This brass ring looks like a curled finger. An eye emblem with a hole through it rests on top. As an action while wearing the ring, you can cause the finger it's on to become ghostly and translucent, conjuring a magical finger to poke, press, or tap something that you can see up to 30 feet away from you. The magical finger then vanishes, and your finger returns to normal.
