# Stylus of Draconic Influence
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This stylus has 8 charges. While holding this stylus, you may spend 1 minute and a number of charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Glyph Of Warding.md\|glyph of warding]] spell, choosing the Spell Glyph option and infusing it with a spell chosen from the following list: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Person.md\|charm person]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fear.md\|fear]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Person.md\|dominate person]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mass Suggestion.md\|mass suggestion]] (6 charges). All spells are cast at their lowest possible level and all spells use your spell save DC. If you do not have a spell save DC, the DC is set to 8 + your Intelligence modifier.

This item recovers `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) charges at dawn. If you use the last charge, there is a 10 percent chance that it crumbles into dust and becomes useless.
