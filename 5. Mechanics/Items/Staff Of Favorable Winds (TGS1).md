# Staff of Favorable Winds
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-Favorable-Winds.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

While you hold this staff, areas affected by strong winds do not count as difficult terrain for you.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it using the required casting time as well as your spell save DC: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cone Of Cold.md\|cone of cold]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gust Of Wind.md\|gust of wind]] (2 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wind Wall.md\|wind wall]] (3 charges).

In addition, while holding the staff, you can create a harmless sensory effect using the air. You can cause leaves to rustle, slam shutters closed in a sudden gust, or cause your clothing to billow dramatically.

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff turns to dust and is blown away by a sudden flurry of wind.
