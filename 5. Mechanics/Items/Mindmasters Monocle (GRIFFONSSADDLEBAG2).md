# Mindmaster's Monocle
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mindmasters-Monocle.webp#right)  


This ancient golden monocle's lens is a roughly hewn ruby. While you wear this monocle, it magically floats in front of your eye, instead of resting on your face, and you can see clearly through its ruby lens. While peering through the lens, you always know if a creature you can see is concentrating on a spell. You perceive a concentrating creature's head as being shrouded in an indigo mist.

This monocle has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn.

## Spells

While wearing the monocle, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Arcane Eye.md\|arcane eye]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]] (2 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Rarys Telepathic Bond.md\|telepathic bond]] (5 charges).

## Mental Assault

While wearing the monocle, you can use a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges to attempt to break a creature's concentration on a spell. The target must be within 60 feet of you, and you must be able to see it. When you do, make an Intelligence check contested by the target's spellcasting ability check. If you win the contest, the target's concentration on the spell ends.
