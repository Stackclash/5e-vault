# Ring of the Fowl Sentinel
*Ring, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-the-Fowl-Sentinel.webp#right)  


This plain bronze ring is embossed with a rooster's head at its center. You can use an action to enchant a friendly chicken or rooster by tapping the ring to its beak. While enchanted, its speed becomes 0 and remains quiet for up to 8 hours. The chicken or rooster lets out a cry after 8 hours or if it sees another Small or larger creature it hasn't seen before. The chicken or rooster has a passive perception of 13 and a +3 bonus to Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks it makes while enchanted. It has 1 hit point, an AC of 10, and can be heard out to 150 feet when it lets out a cry. Only 1 creature can be enchanted by the ring at any time. Tapping the ring to the enchanted chicken or rooster's beak again before the effect ends breaks the enchantment early.
