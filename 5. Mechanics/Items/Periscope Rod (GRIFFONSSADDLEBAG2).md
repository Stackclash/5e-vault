# Periscope Rod
*Rod, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Periscope-Rod.webp#right)  


This silver rod is 1 foot long and is polished to a mirror finish. Its two ends are bent in different directions and are emblazoned with the symbol of an eye. While holding the rod, you can speak its command word as either an action or as part of making a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check, placing your eye against one of the rod's ends. When you do, you can magically see through the rod and outside the far end as if the rod were a spyglass. While looking through the rod in this way, you can use a bonus action to mentally control the angle of the rod's ends, as well as its length. The rod can grow up to 5 feet long in this way, and returns to its normal size when your remove your eye from it.
