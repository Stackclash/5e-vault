# Fireweaver Gloves
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Fireweaver-Gloves.webp#right)  


While wearing these fine golden gloves, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Produce Flame.md\|produce flame]] cantrip (spell attack bonus +5) from it. You can hold this and other small nonmagical flames (such as a torch or candle) as if they were tangible objects, and can sculpt them like clay. Once sculpted, a flame retains its form for 1 minute before returning to normal. A nonmagical flame carried in this way burns for 1 hour before dying. If you drop or throw a nonmagical flame, it immediately burns out.

When you cast *produce flame* using the gloves, the spell's duration is 1 hour, instead of 10 minutes, and it casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. In addition, you can place the spell's conjured flame on the ground at your feet (no action required). When you do, the flame continues to burn harmlessly for up to 1 minute before going out. While you're within 5 feet of the placed flame, you can use an action to pick it back up.

In addition, when you take fire damage while wearing these gloves, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 2`), provided that you have a free hand.
