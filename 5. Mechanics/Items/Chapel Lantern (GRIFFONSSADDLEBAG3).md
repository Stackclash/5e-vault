# Chapel Lantern
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Chapel-Lantern.webp#right)  


This stained glass lantern casts colorful lights around it while lit, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Alternatively, you can fill the lantern with a flask of holy water. While holding it, you can use an action to magically reduce the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

When the lantern is lit using holy water, the light that it sheds almost shimmers with divine magic. When lit in this way, any undead creature within the lantern's bright light has disadvantage on any attack roll it makes. Further, if such a creature starts its turn within the bright light, it immediately takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) radiant damage.

Each time that an undead creature takes radiant damage as result of the lantern's bright light, deduct 1 hour from the lantern's total burn time.
