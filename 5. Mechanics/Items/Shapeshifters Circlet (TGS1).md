# Shapeshifter's Circlet
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shapeshifters-Circlet.webp#right)  


This ivory circlet allows you to recreate some of the natural features of other creatures. While wearing the circlet, you can spend 1 minute to gently massage your ears, forehead, or temples. When you do, you can choose to create one of the following features or effects:

- You can cover or replace your own ears with the form of another creature's.  
- You can summon one or more horns or antlers atop your head.  
- You can change the appearance of your eyes, including their color and pupil shape.  

You can only have 1 of these effects active at a time. The effect lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action, remove the circlet, or fall unconscious. You don't gain any of the senses or abilities of another creature by recreating its physical features in this way.
