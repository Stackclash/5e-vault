# Thaw Bud
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

In their flower stage, these buds have large purple, star-shaped petals and are some of the first to bloom during the thawing months. This is in large part due to an adaptation during their budding stage, in which they secrete a saline solution that causes the snow around it to melt quickly, freeing the trapped bud to warmer sun and giving it the early energy push it needs to grow. However, for a variety of reasons, some clumps never end up flowering and remain in their bud form. While unfortunate to the flower, it is useful for foragers that need a way to cut through thick snow or ice in a hurry.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d6|avg|noform` (`1d6`) charges, corresponding to the number of buds picked. As an action, you may use a charge to crush one of these buds and rub the resulting secretion on a patch of ice or snow, causing it to melt. One charge can melt a patch with an area that is up to 5-foot square and 1 inch thick.
