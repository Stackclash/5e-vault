# Monarch Mantle
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Monarch-Mantle.webp#right)  


While wearing this silky, scalloped cloak, you can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your turn. The cloak flaps behind you like butterfly wings while flying in this way.

In addition, the cloak has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack while you're wearing this cloak, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to take half as much damage from the attack and teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. When you do, you reappear in a flourish of butterflies that remain in that space until the end of the current turn, imposing disadvantage on any attack roll against you while you remain in that space for the duration.
