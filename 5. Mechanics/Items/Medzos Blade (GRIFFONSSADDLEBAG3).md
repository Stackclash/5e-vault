# Medzo's Blade
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Rapier.md\|rapier]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Medzos-Blade.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 P
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The red and black hilt of this weapon is decorated with four card suits, and its blade has seven hash marks carved into its side. This magic weapon deals `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage on a hit, instead of `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`). When you hit with an attack using this weapon and roll a 7 on the damage dice, the next attack roll you make with it before the end of your next turn is made with advantage.
