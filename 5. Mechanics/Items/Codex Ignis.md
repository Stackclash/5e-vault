# Codex Ignis
*Wondrous Item, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/codex-ignis.jpg#right)  


Hu Tai was the last Magister of Fire, and like her contemporaries, the other four elemental magisters, she swore to bind her knowledge into a tome and thereby seal it away, ending the Century of Five Emperors and the wars that ensued as each emperor's elemental magister used their lore to warp and twist reality for their regent.

History records that her efforts were successful. The Five Magisters sealed their power away, and the wars ended. Only rarely in the thousands of years since has one of the five elemental codices emerged and been mastered, and never more than one has been active in the world since.

## Magister of Fire

Your fire spells and cantrips deal their maximum damage. Also, whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, there's a 50% chance you do not use a spell slot. You are immune to fire damage.

## Fire Armor

You are always protected by an invisible [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fire Shield.md\|fire shield]] spell. Whenever you take damage from a melee attack, your fire armor erupts in flame, revealing itself and dealing damage to the attacker in equal amount to the damage taken (instead of `dice: 2d8|avg|noform` (`2d8`)).

## Ward of Fire

Whenever you are surprised in combat, a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Fire Elemental.md\|fire elemental]] immediately arrives and acts on initiative count 20. It attacks your enemies, putting your safety first, obeying your orders second. It remains in the Mundane World for 1 minute, after which it returns to Quintessence.

## Sea of Fire

Once per day as an action, you can cast sea of fire.

- **Sea of Fire (battle magic).** Target: 3 units, Attack: +13, Power: +13. Enemy units damaged by this attack suffer a Power: +11 check on your next round.  

## Blazing Form

By staring into a fire and concentrating on a distant location no larger than a castle, you sense all large (as big as a fireplace or larger) fires there. You can see and hear as if you were the fire.

Also, once per week you can project an illusory duplicate of yourself into the fire. As an action, you can move this blazing duplicate up to your speed, but it can only move to places illuminated by the fire from which it emerged. You can cast your spells originating from your duplicate.

You can make your duplicate gesture, speak, and behave in any way you yourself could. You can see and hear through this duplicate, and you can switch between using its senses and yours as a bonus action. While you're using its senses, your own body is blind and deaf.

The duplicate is insubstantial and has no hit points. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence bonus, after which it evaporates.

While deploying this form, you must sacrifice 1 Hit Die at the end of each round.
