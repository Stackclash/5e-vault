# Incredible Mending Tape
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Incredible-Mending-Tape.webp#right)  


This roll of waxy parchment has a thin layer of adhesive on its underside. The top of the parchment has a repeating series of sigils on it, similar to a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spell Scroll.md\|spell scroll]], which duplicates the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mending.md\|mending]] spell. The roll has 30 feet of 1-inch-wide tape. You can use an action to apply the tape over any break or tear of an object within your reach, connecting the length of tape to either side of the broken area across its largest dimension. At the end of the action, the object is repaired and the tape falls off as its magic is expended. Each application of the tape requires you to use at least 1 foot of the roll's total remaining length.

Applying the tape in this way can allow you to repair longer breaks and tears, such as a long tear on a sail or a running split on a wooden plank, provided that it's larger than 1 foot in only a single dimension. When you use an action to apply the tape to such an object, you must also use any required movement in order to cover the length of the area to be repaired, attaching one end of the tape to either side of it.
