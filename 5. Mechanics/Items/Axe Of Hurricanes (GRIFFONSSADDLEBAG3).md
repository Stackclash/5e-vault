# Axe of Hurricanes
*Major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Axe-of-Hurricanes.webp#right)  


You can use an action to create a powerful whirlwind around you by swinging this magic weapon. Make a melee attack with the axe against each creature within 5 feet of you (other than yourself), with a separate attack roll for reach target. Immediately after the attacks, each creature within 15 feet of you (other than you) must also make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage. It takes a second `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage if it's within 10 feet of you, and a third `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) if it's within 5 feet. If the creature is Medium or smaller, it's also thrown up to 10 feet away from you. On a success, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't thrown.

Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
