# Armor of St. Gaed the Confessor
*Heavy Armor, unknown (magic)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/SaF/socr-armor-confessor.jpg#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This set of magic plate mail covered in silver filigree grants +1 Armor Class to the wearer. Also, once per month, the owner can summon the spirits of the Blue Dragon Phalanx to aid them in battle. The Phalanx serves for 1 hour or two battles, whichever happens first.

The spirits of the Blue Dragonflight will fight your enemies, but if ordered to do anything other than fight in a battle against an enemy army, they stand around looking confused, wondering what's happened to their bodies and the world they once knew.
