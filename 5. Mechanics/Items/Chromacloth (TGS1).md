# Chromacloth
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Sling.md\|sling]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Chromacloth.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 bludgeoning
- **Range**: 30/120
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]]

This silken cloth is enchanted using a unique blend of abjuration and evocation magic, allowing it to be used for a number of purposes. At any one time it can be one of four colors: red, yellow, green, or blue. You can change the chromacloth's color to another one as an action.

You can wear the chromacloth as a headband or wrap to gain resistance to the damage type associated with the cloth's color. Once the cloth reduces damage taken in this way, it can't do so again until the following dawn.

Alternatively, the cloth can be fashioned to be an effective sling. Ammunition fired from the sling deals damage of a type matching the cloth's color instead of bludgeoning. Refer to the table below for a reference of the chromacloth's associated colors and damage types:

**Chromacloth Sling Damage**

| Color | Damage Type |
|-------|-------------|
| Red | Fire |
| Yellow | Lightning |
| Green | Poison |
| Blue | Cold |
