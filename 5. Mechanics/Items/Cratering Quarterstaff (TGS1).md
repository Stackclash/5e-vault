This thick, stony quarterstaff requires a Strength score of 17 or higher in order to wield. Despite glowing with embers, it feels comfortably warm to the touch. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This quarterstaff has 5 charges and regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. Once on each of your turns immediately after you make an attack with the quarterstaff, you can expend 1 of its charges (no action required) to slam the weapon into the ground and create a 10-foot cone of intense tremors and flame in the direction of the original attack's target. Any creature caught in the cone must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. The original attack's target has disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage and `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.
