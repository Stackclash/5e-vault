# Boots of Dendallen
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Boots-of-Dendallen.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

These dark, fleshy boots grant marvelous powers and enhance your normal movement. While wearing these boots, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can hover up to 20 feet off the ground in this way, leaving behind a thin trail of shadow when you do. In addition, when you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action while wearing the boots, you can move an extra 10 feet.

The boots have 4 charges and regain `dice:1d3+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the boots, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of their charges to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Expeditious Retreat.md\|expeditious retreat]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Misty Step.md\|misty step]] spell from them. When you cast *misty step* in this way, the normally silver mist that surrounds you is dark and ominous.

## Curse

When you pull these boots over your feet for the first time, make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you are aware of the curse's effects and can immediately remove the boots before they extend it to you. On a failure, the boots' muscly sinews dig into your legs and feet, interlocking with your own flesh. You immediately take `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) necrotic damage as the tainted muscles and flesh latch onto you, and you can't remove the boots unless you're targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While you wear the boots, your feet sometimes move in unexpected ways. You make Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) checks and Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage, and it costs you an extra 10 feet of movement to stand up after you fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

If you fail the saving throw to resist the curse and later remove the boots, you take another `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) necrotic damage as they painfully tear themselves from your body.
