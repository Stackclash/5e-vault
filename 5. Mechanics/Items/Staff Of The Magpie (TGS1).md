# Staff of the Magpie
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Staff-of-the-Magpie.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic stone staff weighs 10 pounds and has the bust of a magpie at its top. While holding the staff, you gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) checks made to search for treasure or a specific item you're looking for.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from it: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fly.md\|fly]] (3 charges) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Locate Object.md\|locate object]] (2 charges). The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff as the magpie springs to life and flies away.
