# Scepter of the Tyrant's Gaze
*Rod, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scepter-of-the-Tyrants-Gaze.webp#right)  


This gilded rod features a sculpted eye bound within a mass of entangled tentacles. At the center of the eye is a dark gemstone. While holding the rod, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

The scepter has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the scepter, you can use an action to expend up to 3 of its charges, firing a beam of colored light for each expended charge. Each beam can target a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you; make a ranged spell attack for each one, using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) force damage and suffers an additional effect (save DC 15). Roll a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) and use the table below to determine each beam's color and additional effect.

`dice: [[Scepter Of The Tyrants Gaze (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^beam-color-additional-effect]]`

| dice: d10 | Beam Color | Additional Effect |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Red | The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the start of your next turn or until it takes any damage. |
| 2 | Orange | The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of your next turn. |
| 3 | Yellow | The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn. |
| 4 | Green | The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be thrown 1d6 Ã— 5 feet in a random direction and be restrained until the start of your next turn. |
| 5 | Cyan | The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have its speed reduced by half for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. |
| 6 | Blue | The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The sleeper remains unconscious until it takes any damage or if another creature uses an action to wake it. |
| 7 | Indigo | The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns until it either succeeds on the saving throw and ends the effect, or fails the saves for a third time. If the target fails the saving throw for a third time, it becomes petrified until the start of your next turn, at which point the effect ends. |
| 8 | Violet | The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking an extra 4d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 9 | Indigo | The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking an extra 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 10 | Black | The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking an extra 8d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. |

Alternatively, you can expend 3 or more charges from the scepter to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Counterspell.md\|counterspell]] from it, using your reaction. The spell's level increases by 1 for each charge you spend after the third.
