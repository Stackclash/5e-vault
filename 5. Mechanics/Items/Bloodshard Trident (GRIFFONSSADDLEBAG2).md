This magic trident has grooves in its obsidian surface that are used to channel blood in rituals of self-sacrifice. While holding the trident, you can use a bonus action to make a blood offering. When you do, choose a number of hit points to sacrifice. You take necrotic damage equal to the amount you sacrifice, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. For every 5 hit points you sacrifice, the trident creates 1 shard of magic obsidian, which floats alongside the trident's three prongs for 1 minute. You can have up to 3 shards in this way at a time. The trident deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) piercing damage to any target it hits for each floating shard it has.

When you throw the trident while it has at least 1 floating shard, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.
