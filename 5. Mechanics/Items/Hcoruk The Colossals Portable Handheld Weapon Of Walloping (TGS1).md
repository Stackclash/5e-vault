# Hcor'uk the Colossal's Portable Handheld Weapon of Walloping
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Flail.md\|flail]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Hcoruk-the-Colossals-Portable-Handheld-Weapon-of-Walloping.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 200.0 lbs.

This flail has the two-handed, heavy, and reach properties. Attacks made with the flail deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage, or `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) if the target is a structure. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon against a Huge or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

The rope and boulder that make this weapon are magically attached and can't be separated. The boulder weighs 200 pounds but is effortless for you to lift once you attune to the weapon.
