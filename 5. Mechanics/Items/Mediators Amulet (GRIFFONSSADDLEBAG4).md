# Mediator's Amulet
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Mediators-Amulet.webp#right)  


A small, shattered sword hangs from this gilded chain, and its clasp is made of two shaking hands. While wearing this necklace, you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]]. It has 5 charges for the following properties, and it regains `dice:1d3+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn.

## Deescalate

You can expend 1 of the necklace's charges as an action to speak a calming string of words and choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do, each creature of your choice within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 hour. The effect ends early if you or your companions do anything to threaten or harm any of the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creatures. When you charm a creature in this way, you can choose to make it indifferent about creatures of your choice that it's hostile toward. When the effect ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

## Of One Blood

When you restore hit points to a creature, you can choose to expend 1 of the necklace's charges to take an amount of necrotic damage up to the amount restored, which can't be reduced or negated in any way. When you do, the healed creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage you took in this way.
