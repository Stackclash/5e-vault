# Bullseye Dart
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Dart.md\|dart]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Bullseye-Dart.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 0.25 lbs.

The weighted end of this dart is made to resemble a stylized eye, and its shaft is hewn from a bull's horn. Your attacks with this magic weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 16-20. Once this happens, the dart loses this property for 1 minute. In the meantime, it can still be used as a magic dart.
