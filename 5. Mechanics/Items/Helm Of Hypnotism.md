# Helm of Hypnotism
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While wearing this helmet, if you force a creature to roll a saving throw to resist being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you, that creature makes that saving throw at disadvantage so long as it can see you. In addition, if you succeed on a saving throw to resist being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by a creature you can see, you may spend your reaction to impose an identical effect on that creature, as if you had used that spell or ability yourself.
