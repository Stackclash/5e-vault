# Rageroot
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

I never thought that anger could be expressed in vegetable form, but I stand corrected when I hold a rageroot. This distinctive, carrot-sized tuber is bright red and shaped into three branching prongs as if it is trying to stab the earth itself. Its taste is no less fierce as it packs a strong acrid punch followed by a prolonged spiciness that invigorates the senses and energises the mind in a way similar to a powerful adrenaline rush.

## Effect:

As an action you may eat this root. If you do so, you become immune to the stunned, fear, and charmed conditions for the next 10 minutes as you become filled with a manic rage.
