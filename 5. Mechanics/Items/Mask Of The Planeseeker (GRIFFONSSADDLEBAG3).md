# Mask of the Planeseeker
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mask-of-the-Planeseeker.webp#right)  


This elaborate mask was first worn by an interplanar diplomat. While wearing it, you understand any spoken language you hear, and when you speak, any creature that can hear you and knows at least one language can understand what you say. The mask also functions as an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amulet Of The Planes.md\|amulet of the planes]]. You can't be teleported against your will or unwillingly transported to another plane of existence by another creature or hostile effect while wearing this mask.

Depending on the plane of existence it's on, the mask's appearance and effect changes. Its appearance is stylized and ornate, regardless of the form it takes. Refer to the table below to determine its effects on various planes.

| Plane of Existence | Mask Appearance | Gemstone Color and Damage Type |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Material Plane | An ornate rendition of your own face | Pearlescent; Force |
| Elemental Plane of Air | The face of a djinni or air elemental | White; Lightning |
| Elemental Plane of Earth | The face of a basilisk or earth elemental | Brown; Thunder |
| Elemental Plane of Fire | The face of an efreeti or fire elemental | Red; Fire |
| Elemental Plane of Water | The face of a merfolk or water elemental | Blue; Cold |
| Fey-influenced plane | The face of an elf or dryad | Violet; Psychic |
| Shadow-influenced plane | The face of a shadow or wraith | Black; Necrotic |
| Fiend-influenced plane | The face of a balor or rakshasa | Orange; Fire |
| Celestial-influenced plane | The face of a platinum dragon or solar | Yellow; Radiant |

The mask has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the mask, you can expend 1 of its charges as a bonus action to change the plane of existence the mask is associated with. After 1 hour, the mask reverts to its normal form.
