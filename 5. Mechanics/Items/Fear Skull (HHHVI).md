# Fear Skull
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While holding this item, you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fear.md\|fear]] spell, requiring no other components. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Furthermore, anytime a creature within 30 feet of this skull makes a saving throw to avoid the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|fear]] condition, they make that save at disadvantage.
