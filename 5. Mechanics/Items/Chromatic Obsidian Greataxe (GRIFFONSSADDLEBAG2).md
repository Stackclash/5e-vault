This prismatic greataxe is made using chromatic obsidian, a dazzling type of stone found where several Elemental Planes meet. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A target takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) cold damage, `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage, `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) lightning damage, and `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Roll the damage dice separately, recording any 6 you roll. For each 6 you roll in this way, use the table below to determine which of the following effects apply.

| Damage Type | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Cold | The target's speed is halved until the end of your next turn. |
| Fire | The target takes an extra 6 fire damage at the end of its next turn. |
| Lightning | The target can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. |
| Radiant | The next attack roll made against the target before the end of your next turn has advantage. |
