*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/ghostfirepack.webp#right]]  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This 1-foot cube mechanical pack contains the key components of a cadaver collector's internal engine and is designed to be attached to a suit of plate armor to bolster the wearer's abilities with unholy, mechanical endurance. Attaching this pack to the back of a suit of plate armor takes 1 hour and takes 10 minutes to remove it. A suit of plate armor that has had this pack attached to it has the following properties:

- The wearer of the suit's Strength score increases to 18 if it was less than that before.  
- The wearer of the suit is immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] condition and has advantage on Constitution saving throws.  
- The wearer of the suit may use their bonus action to imbue themselves with necrotic energy, causing their next successful weapon attack this turn to deal an extra `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the wearer has killed another creature.
