# Idea Bulb
*Wondrous item, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This morbid looking glass bulb contains the preserved brain of a cranium rat. When a creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher comes within 10 feet of this item, it will light up, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. If 5 of these bulbs are grouped together, the light increases to a bright light in a 10-foot radius, with another 10 feet beyond that of dim light. If 5 of these bulbs are grouped together, the light increases again to a bright light in a 30-foot radius, with another 20 feet of dim light beyond that.

A creature that comes within 10 feet of this item for the first time in a turn may mentally command them to not react to their presence until they mentally command them to react to them again.
