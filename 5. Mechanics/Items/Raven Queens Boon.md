# Raven Queen's Boon
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This boon takes the form of a necklace strung with the Raven Queen's symbol and several feathers plucked from a freshly slain raven. While wearing and attuned to it, you have advantage on death saving throws. In addition, when you make a successful weapon attack against a target, you may choose to deal an additional `dice: 1d12|avg|noform` (`1d12`) necrotic damage. Once this ability has been used once, it may not be used again until you complete a short or long rest.
