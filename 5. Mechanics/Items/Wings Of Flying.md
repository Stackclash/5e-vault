# Wings of Flying
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/wings-of-flying.webp#right]]  


While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) hours.
