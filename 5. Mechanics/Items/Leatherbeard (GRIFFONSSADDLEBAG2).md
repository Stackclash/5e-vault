# Leatherbeard
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Leatherbeard.webp#right)  


This leather mask sits over your mouth and chin and can be worn or removed using an action. While wearing the mask, you grow an illusory beard. You choose the color and style of the beard each time you wear the mask. The beard can be up to 2 feet long. A DC 10 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check reveals the beard is an illusion.

For every 7 consecutive days that pass in which you do not remove the mask, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that the beard becomes real. When it does, the mask is destroyed. The real beard doesn't continue to grow unless you can already naturally grow a beard.
