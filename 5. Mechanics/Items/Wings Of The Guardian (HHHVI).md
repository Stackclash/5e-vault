# Wings of the Guardian
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

These wings are joined to a leather harness that allows a humanoid to comfortably wear them on their back. While wearing these wings, you have a flight speed equal to your movement speed.

In addition, you may spend your action to teleport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you have used this ability once, you may not use it again until you finish your next short rest.
