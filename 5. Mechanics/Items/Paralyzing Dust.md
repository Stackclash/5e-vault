# Paralyzing Dust
*Adventuring Gear, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

You may spend an action to blow this pouch of grey dust into the face of a non-undead creature within 5 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] for 1 minute. That creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

If this dust is dissolved into a liquid first and then drunk by a non-undead creature, they automatically fail the save and all subsequent saves for the next minute.
