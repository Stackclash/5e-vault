# Eyedrops of Clarity
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Eyedrops-of-Clarity.webp#right)  


This eyedropper is stoppered with a cork at the opening of its spherical top, which is designed in the likeness of an eye. When found, the eyedropper contains `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) doses of magical solution. When uncorked, the solution inside begins to drip from the eyedropper. A creature can use its action to uncork and apply 1 dose of the eyedrops to itself or another willing creature that it can see within reach, stoppering the eyedropper again once finished. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] creature that has eyes and receives a dose of the eyedrops ceases to be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]]. In addition, that creature gains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 30 feet and has advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight for 1 hour. If the creature already has [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]], its range increases by 30 feet for the duration.
