# Moon Muzzle Mixture
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

Drinking this potion completely cures a creature of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Variant Rules/Player Characters As Lycanthropes (MM).md\|lycanthropy]] if taken before that creature experiences its first full moon as a lycanthrope. If drunk after that, or if drunk by a natural born lycanthrope, a lycanthrope is able to ignore the usual transformative effects of the full moon for the next 28 days.
