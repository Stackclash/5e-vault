# Festerwood Masher
*Major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Festerwood-Masher.webp#right)  


This festerwood hammer has amber pustules on its end that have enriched the wood with its corrosive properties. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

In addition, this hammer has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. When you hit a creature or object with the hammer, you can expend 1 of its charges to magically release some of the corrosive acid. When you do, if the target is Large or smaller, that target takes a cumulative −1 penalty to its AC that lasts for 1 minute. If the target is Huge or Gargantuan, it takes this penalty after you expend either 2 or 3 charges in this way, respectively. This hammer deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) acid damage to any target it hits for each −1 penalty to AC it has in this way.
