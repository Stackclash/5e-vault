# Windswept Kite
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Windswept-Kite.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This blue silk kite is 5 feet across and is attached to a 60-foot string. It weighs 1 pound and can be folded into a 6-inch square. While holding the kite, you can use a bonus action to toss it aloft and speak its command word. When you do, you also choose how much string to let out, between 10 and 60 feet. The kite then expands to its full size (if it was folded) and creates a cylinder of moderate wind of 10 miles per hour, which allows it to continue flying. The cylinder's height and diameter is the same as the amount of let-out string, up to 60 feet. The kite and top of the cylinder remain centered above your location. You can use another bonus action to speak the flying kite's command word to end the effect and cause it to fall softly back into your hand. You can change the wind's direction at the start of each of your turns for the duration.

You can use the kite to create this wind for up to 1 hour, all at once or in several shorter intervals, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. The effect ends early if you are no longer holding the string, at which point it flies up to `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) times 10 feet in a random direction before landing on the ground. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the string (AC 15) severs it, causing the kite to fly away as if you let go of the string. The severed string can later be reattached by holding its ends together for 1 minute.
