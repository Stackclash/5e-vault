# Pillow of Perfect Rest
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This pillow is stuffed with couatl feathers and is extraordinarily soft and comfortable. A creature sleeping on this pillow only has good dreams and only requires half their usual sleeping time in order to feel properly rested (the length of a long rest is unaffected though).

In addition, a creature sleeping on this pillow is immune to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]] attempts and to any effect that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its location. It is also immune to any magical effect that would affect its sleep, such as the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dream.md\|dream]]. Only one creature may benefit from this pillow's effect at a time.
