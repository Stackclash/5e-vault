# Pollinator Carapace
*Major, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Pollinator-Carapace.webp#right)  


This black and yellow armor has a billowing plume of soft fur around its neck and chest. Draped over its shoulders is a scalloped cape that's split into two translucent, wing-like ends.

The armor has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 of its charges (no action required) to activate the cape, transforming it into a pair of insect-like wings for 1 hour. For the duration of the wings, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.

## Beekeeper's Commitment

While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the armor regains all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`), and gains the following benefit:

## Pollinator

While the armor's cape is transformed, it releases a sparkling mist of enchanting pollen. For the duration, any insect or plant creature that targets you with an attack or harmful spell must first make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.
