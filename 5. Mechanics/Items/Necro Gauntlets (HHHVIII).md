# Necro Gauntlets
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing these gauntlets, your unarmed strikes deal `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage instead of the damage normal for an unarmed strike and they count as magical for the purposes of overcoming magic resistance.
