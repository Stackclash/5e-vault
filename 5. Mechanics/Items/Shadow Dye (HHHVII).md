# Shadow Dye
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

You may spend your action to pour this dye on yourself. If you do so, you take on a semi-corporeal shadowy form for the next hour. During this time, you gain a vulnerability to radiant damage and resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. In addition, so long as you are within dim light or darkness, you may take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action as a bonus action, and you make Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks at advantage.
