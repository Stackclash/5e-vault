# Charming Knife
*Melee Weapon, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: Crafted by, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

As an action, you may speak this weapon's command word to activate its ability for the next minute. While this dagger's ability is active, any damage it deals to a creature that is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you does not count as damaging it or doing anything harmful to it for the sake of potentially ending the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charm effect]]. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
