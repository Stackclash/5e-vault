# Phoenix Rocket Sword
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greatsword.md\|greatsword]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Phoenix-Rocket-Sword.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This heavy, steel greatsword creates a powerful fan of flames from curious, whirring chambers mounted to the blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The sword has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn.

As an action, you can hold the sword out in front of you and speak its command word to expend up to 5 of its charges, causing a jet of flame to erupt from it. When you do, the sword emits a roar that's audible out to 100 feet, and you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 20 feet for each charge you expend. You can choose to fail this saving throw, whose DC equals 10 + the number of charges you expend. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Pointing the blade down and expending charges in this way launches you upward instead. If you do and you are not launched, the sword's flames spread out in a 15-foot radius circle, centered on you.

The jet of flame spreads out in a 15-foot cone and moves with you if you're pushed. Any creature in the area when the flame first appears or when it moves into the creature's space must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) fire damage, or half as much fire damage on a success. The fire damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) for each additional charge you expend beyond the first.

If you strike an object because of this forced movement, such as a wall or floor, you take `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) bludgeoning damage for every charge you expend and are knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. If you strike a creature, you and that creature take the same bludgeoning damage and must each succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 10 + the number of charges you expend) or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].
