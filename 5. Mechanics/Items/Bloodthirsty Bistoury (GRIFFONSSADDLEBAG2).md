This elegant, dark dagger is never bloodstained and effortlessly pierces flesh. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When this dagger is used by an evil-aligned creature, any creature hit by it doesn't bleed from the attack or the wound it leaves behind for 10 minutes.
