# Floral Chime
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Floral-Chime.webp#right)  


A faint, floral perfume wafts from this handbell and radiates powerfully from you when you ring it. While holding the bell, you can use an action to ring it and instantly make any flowers blossom, any seed pods open, and any leaf buds bloom that are within 60 feet of you, provided the sound can reach them. Once this property of the bell has been used, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

Any swarm of insects within earshot of the bell must immediately make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become distracted by the smell of flowers, either from the bell's perfume or from any that bloomed nearby. Regardless, a swarm that fails the saving throw is indifferent towards you and your companions for 1 hour or until it's threatened or harmed.
