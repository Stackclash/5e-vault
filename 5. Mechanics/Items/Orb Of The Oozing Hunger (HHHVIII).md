# Orb of the Oozing Hunger
*Wondrous item, cursed item, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVIII/OrboftheOozingHunger.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20Artifact\|Crafted Artifact]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

The worshippers of [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Juiblex (MPMM).md\|Juiblex]] are among the most pathetic and depraved of all demon cultists. So indoctrinated into their patron's mantra of consuming everything, Juiblex's worshippers make it their goal to be consumed by the Demon Lord themselves, joining it as one writhing mass for all eternity. In their quiet and meditative moments, these cultists report seeing a single orb made of writhing dark-green slime that seems to stare through their bodies and into their souls. This is the legendary Orb of the Oozing Hunger, a demonic artifact made from Juiblex's body that it intends as its final attempt at assimilating the world into its own mass. Many cultists believe that any defeat that [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Juiblex (MPMM).md\|Juiblex]] suffers is actually planned by them as a way to create this orb and spread its influence into corners of the multiverse that it would normally be unable to access.

In order to attune to this item, you must fully dissolve the body of a Medium sized creature in acid. Then, while holding this item, you must submerge yourself into this acid pit, taking `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) acid damage as you do so. If this damage kills you, your soul is sent to the Slime Pits in the Abyss. If you survive, you become attuned to this item and your body takes on a distinct green hue. Your skin constantly drips a sticky mucus, and you exude a horrible odor reminiscent of rotting flesh. A creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) acid damage. You are also immune to acid damage. When your attunement to this item ends, your body reverts to its original form.

If an ability of this item imposes a saving throw, the DC is calculated at 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.

## Random Properties

The Orb of the Oozing Hunger has the following random properties:

- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial]] property  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Beneficial Properties.md\|minor beneficial]] properties  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  

## Spellcasting

Using this item, you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blight.md\|blight]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contagion.md\|contagion]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gaseous Form.md\|gaseous form]] spells once each per long rest. You do not require any components to cast these spells and you cast them at their lowest level.

## One With the Hunger

As an action, you may transform into an ooze-like form for the next hour. While in this form, you retain your basic shape and anatomy, but your body is composed entirely of a corrosive, ooze substance. Your equipment does not transform with you. When you transform, you may choose to have your equipment remain on your body or to slide off and drop to the ground around you. While in your ooze-like form, you gain the following benefits:

- You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.  
- The damage you deal to a creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you increases to `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) acid damage.  
- If a nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood hits you, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits you is destroyed after dealing damage. In addition, you may destroy up to 2 inches of a nonmagical wood or metal item by remaining in contact with it for one round.  
- You become resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.  
- Every time you deal acid damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to the amount of acid damage you dealt unless you took fire damage since the end of your last turn.  

## Eject Slime

As an action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target suffers `dice:10d10|noform|avg` (`10d10`) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent −1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent −1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to −5, the object is destroyed.

## Spreading Corruption

Whenever you kill a creature with acid damage, you can use your reaction to cause a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Gray Ooze.md\|gray ooze]] to rise from the corpse [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Ochre Jelly.md\|...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (your DM has the stats)]. The [ochre jelly]] is loyal to you and acts directly after you on the initiative order. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Ochre Jelly.md\|ochre jelly]] remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, after which it dissipates.

## Curse

When you become attuned to the orb, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Juiblex (MPMM).md\|Madness of Juiblex table]]* ^[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|See the info tab] and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Orb

This item can only be destroyed if it is constantly suspended in clean, fresh water for a year. The water must be changed every 24 hours, otherwise it becomes fouled and the process must start over. After it has been kept in water for a year, the orb must be subjected to fire or radiant damage from a good-aligned creature, after which the orb is vaporized, leaving nothing behind except ash. This is easier said than done however, since while in the water, the orb will continuously beckon for cultists and other mad individuals to seek it out and rescue it from its imminent destruction.
