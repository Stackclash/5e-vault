# Axe of Essential Inversion
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greataxe.md\|greataxe]]), legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Axe-of-Essential-Inversion.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

This axe's mighty twin blades are edged with ruby and sapphire. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) force damage to any celestial or fiend it hits.

## Charges

The axe has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

## Banishment

When you make an attack with this weapon, you can expend 2 of its charges to empower it with planar magic, or 1 charge if the target is a celestial or fiend. If the attack hits, the target is affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Banishment.md\|banishment]] spell (save DC 17). You must concentrate on the spell as normal, but if you fail a Constitution saving throw made to maintain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] on the spell when you take damage, you can expend 1 of the weapon's charges to succeed instead.

## Dilution

When you hit a celestial or fiend with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) force damage. When you do, the target's essence is diluted until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the target is considered to have no damage resistances, immunities, or vulnerabilities.

## Inversion

When you reduce a celestial or fiend to 0 hit points using the axe, you can expend 1 of its charges to force the target to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target's sense of self is shattered; it drops to 1 hit point instead, and its alignment is changed. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If its alignment is true neutral or unaligned, or if the target has legendary actions, this property has no effect on it.
