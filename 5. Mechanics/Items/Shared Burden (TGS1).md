# Shared Burden
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a warlock)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shared-Burden.webp#right)  


This set of chained rings and bracers is a sign of the pact you forged with your patron. When you attune to the item, the small spikes that line the inside of the bands become harmless and feel like a warm, gentle caress against your skin. Once attuned, you can also use it as a spellcasting focus.

Whenever you would deal damage to a creature with a warlock spell or cantrip, you can choose to add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to the spell's damage. When you do, you take psychic damage equal to half your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), rounded up. This psychic damage ignores resistances and immunities.
