# Mutated Eye Stalk Wand
*Wand, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This wand has 5 charges. While holding this wand, you may spend an action and 1 charge to shoot a magical ray of energy at a target within 120 feet of you. The type of ray depends on the type of mindwitness eye stalk that the wand was crafted from. Consult the list below to find out what your wand does.

- **1. Aversion Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **2. Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **3. Psychic Ray.** The target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) psychic damage.  
- **4. Slowing Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **5. Stunning Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **6. Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you move it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of your next turn or until you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]]. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 feet in any direction. You can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.  

The wand recovers `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) charges at dawn. When you use the last charge of the wand, there is a 10 percent chance that it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
