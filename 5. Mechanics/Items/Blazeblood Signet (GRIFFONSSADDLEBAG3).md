# Blazeblood Signet
*Ring, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

The gem at the center of this dark silver ring is always warm to the touch. While wearing the ring, your blood feels unnaturally hot, and it feels as though the ring itself pulses to match your heartbeat. You gain the following benefits while wearing this ring:

- You regain all of your spent Hit Dice whenever you finish a long rest.  
- Whenever you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of a short rest, you automatically regain the maximum number of hit points possible.  
- You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit.  

## Blood Conversion

While wearing this ring, you can choose to spend 1 or more Hit Dice whenever you hit a creature with an attack, up to a maximum of 5 Hit Dice per turn. For each Hit Die spent, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to half the total (rounded up), and the target of the attack takes fire damage equal to the same amount.

## Curse

This ring is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. For as long as you remain cursed, you regain half as many hit points whenever a spell or magical effect restores them.
