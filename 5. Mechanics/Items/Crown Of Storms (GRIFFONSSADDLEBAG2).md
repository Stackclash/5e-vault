# Crown of Storms
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Crown-of-Storms.webp#right)  


This crown was created by storm giants as a reward for a brave band of much smaller adventurers. While wearing this crown, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. If you are subjected to an effect that deals lightning or thunder damage and allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no lightning or thunder damage if you succeed on the saving throw. If you are a giant, you can choose to wear this crown as a ring, instead.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to take on the aspect of the stormbringer. When you do, you spark with electrical power and your eyes glow bright white. The aspect lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early using a bonus action. While the aspect persists, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. For the duration, you also gain the following benefits:

- You can use an action to release a bolt of lightning at a point on the ground that you can see that's within 60 feet of you and at least 15 feet below you. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- You can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Thunderwave.md\|thunderwave]] spell (2nd-level version, save DC 17). The first time you cast this spell each time you take on the aspect, it's cast at 4th level instead.  
- When an attacker within 30 feet hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to send out a bolt of lightning at the attacker. The attacker must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each time the attacker hits you again before the end of this turn, it must repeat the saving throw.  

Once this property of the crown has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
