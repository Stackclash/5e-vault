# Sir Varion's Mantle
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Sir-Varions-Mantle.webp#right)  


This sturdy, waterproof riding cape once belonged to Sir Varion, a famed knight known for his charm and eccentricity. While wearing this cape, you can spend 10 minutes to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Steed.md\|find steed]] spell from it. When you do, the summoned steed is in the form of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Toad.md\|giant toad]]. The steed remains for the duration or until your attunement to the mantle ends. When the steed drops to 0 hit points, this property can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

In addition, while you're mounted, you have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) checks.
