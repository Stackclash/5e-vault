# Pearl Elixir
*Potion, legendary*  


This silvery-white elixir has a variety of effects depending on whether it is drunk, rubbed on a creature's feet, or smeared on the hull of a boat. If drunk, the elixir confers the ability to breathe both air and water with equal ease. If rubbed on the feet, the elixir provides a creature with the ability to walk on water as if wearing a ring of water walking. If placed on the hull of a boat or similar vessel, the vessel gains a damage threshold of 20 against all environmental effects, and anyone piloting the vessel has advantage on ability checks associated with it. All of these effects are permanent.

## Ingredients

The scale of a merfolk princess, a vial of pure elemental water, and the eye of a kraken.
