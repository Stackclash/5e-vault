# Armor of the Eternal Flame
*Heavy Armor, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Properties**: Crafted by
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +3 bonus to AC and you have resistance to fire damage. In addition, if you receive damage that would reduce your hit points to 0, you may use your reaction to negate that damage and release a fiery nova from yourself, forcing all creatures within 10 feet of you to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, suffering `dice: 4d8|avg|noform` (`4d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this ability, you may not use it again until your next long rest.
