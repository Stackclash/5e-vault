# Indigo Stray's Conviction
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Indigo-Strays-Conviction.webp#right)  


This set of midnight-colored gloves effervesce with slow wisps of smoke, and were famously worn by a royal assassin who had been freed of their bindings. At the hems are old, well-worn manacles that have been fastened to the gloves and magically clasp onto your forearms when worn. If you're missing any arms, hands, or fingers when you attune to the gloves, dark, smoky copies of the missing appendages magically rematerialize. The limbs are fully capable parts of your body and remain as long as you're attuned to the gloves.

While attuned to the gloves, you have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. You can see normally in magical and nonmagical darkness within this range. If you already have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]], wearing the gloves increases its range by 60 feet, although you can only see within magical darkness within the first 60 feet of its range.

The gloves have 7 charges which are used for the following properties while wearing them. They regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

## "Allow Me!"

When an attacker that you can see within 15 feet of you deals damage to a friendly creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to immediately move up to 15 feet, and make one weapon attack against the attacker. On a hit, you have advantage on attack rolls against that target until the end of your next turn.

## "By His Will!"

You can use a bonus action to expend 3 of the gloves' charges to surround yourself with a dark, smoking aura of retribution. The aura extends from you in a 15-foot radius, creating an area of magical darkness. A creature with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. When a hostile creature enters this darkness for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage. If you roll an 8 on both of the damage dice for this effect, the creature becomes magically [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by the aura's smoky tendrils. The creature remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] until it's no longer within the aura, or until it uses an action to make a DC 17 Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check (its choice), escaping the grapple on a success. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you die, are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]], or end the effect early using a bonus action.

## "The Price of Freedom!"

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend 2 of the gloves' charge to magically take that damage, instead of the creature taking it. Alternatively, if a creature that you can see within this range becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], you can use this reaction to suffer the effects of that condition instead of the target creature.

## Flaw

The Indigo Stray's conviction compels its wearer to take swift, decisive action to prove themselves. While attuned to the gloves, you gain the following flaw: "I will do what I must to demonstrate my ability, and I won't stop until a job is done." In addition, if you are attuned to the bracers for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to prove yourself drives you to obsession, and even minor acts of kindness compel you to feel heavily indebted. You can't attune to the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Red Queens Burden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Red Queen's burden]] or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Violet Kings Promise (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Violet King's promise]]. If you are already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Violet Kings Promise (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Violet King's promise]] becomes your sovereign leader, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Red Queens Burden (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Red Queen's burden]] or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Violet Kings Promise (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Violet King's promise]] without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell, but not while you are attuned to the gloves.
