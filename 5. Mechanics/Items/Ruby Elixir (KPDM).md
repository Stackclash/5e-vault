# Ruby Elixir
*Potion, legendary*  


This vermilion-hued elixir neutralizes all magical and nonmagical diseases and poisons, all curses of 8th level or lower, all exhaustion effects, and restores hit points as a superior healing potion. If this elixir is poured over a corpse that's been dead for no more than a year, it restores the creature to life as per the resurrection spell even if the corpse could normally not be resurrected.

## Ingredients

A mixture of purest cinnabar, the blood of a slain dragon of at least adult age, and the hearts of six celestial tigers willingly donated to the alkemancer.
