# Wand of Chromatic Wrath
*Wand, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This wand has 10 charges. While holding it, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage of either fire, lightning, poison, acid, or cold damage, you may spend a number of charges to change that damage type into another one of the damage types from that list. The amount of charges you spend are equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast that spell (cantrips do not require any charges). In addition, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls made while holding this wand.

The wand recovers all expended charges at dawn. If you use the last charge on this wand, there is a 90% chance chance that it crumbles into dust and becomes useless.
