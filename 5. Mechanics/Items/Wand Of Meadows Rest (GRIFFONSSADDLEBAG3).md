# Wand of Meadow's Rest
*Wand, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wand-of-Meadows-Rest.webp#right)  


This wand looks and smells like a flourishing sprig of lavender. It has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into petals and is destroyed.

## Sleep

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleep.md\|sleep]] spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend, up to 5th level. Creatures that have a trait that grants them advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on smell are considered to have half as many current hit points for the purposes of determining the number of creatures affected by the spell.

## Nature's Respite

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 7 of its charges and wave it in the air above you. You and up to five willing creatures you choose within 20 feet of you are lulled into a restful sleep. A sleeping creature remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for 10 minutes. It wakes up early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. If a creature remains asleep for the full duration, it wakes up and gains the benefit of a short rest. This property of the wand fails if you aren't outside.
