# Lionguard Chain
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Lionguard-Chain.webp#right)  


This armor was once the standard equipment of elite guards for a now-fallen empire. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and you can add your proficiency bonus to any Charisma check with which you aren't already proficient when interacting with common guards or soldiers.
