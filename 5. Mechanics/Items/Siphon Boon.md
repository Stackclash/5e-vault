# Siphon Boon
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#cast%20a%20spell\|cast a spell]], you may instead cast it as if you used a spell slot one level higher than the one you actually used, even if such a level would not normally be available to you. Once you have used this ability once, you may not use it again until you have finished a short or long rest. If you are attuned to this item, you may also use it as a spellcasting focus.
