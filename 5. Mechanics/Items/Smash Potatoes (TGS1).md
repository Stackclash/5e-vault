# Smash Potatoes
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Smash-Potatoes.webp#right)  


This hearty root vegetable is grown by the clerics and champions of a god of war and combat, whose strength is said to make its way onto the Material Plane through their gardens. Eating one of these vaguely fist-shaped potatoes will cause your hands to itch for the thrill of combat. Eating a potato increases your unarmed damage to `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) for 1 hour. Each additional eaten potato increases the duration by 1 hour. You can eat up to 3 potatoes before needing to finish a long rest to benefit from them again. If you already have an unarmed combat die that is 1d4 or higher, this vegetable has no effect but is nevertheless delicious.
