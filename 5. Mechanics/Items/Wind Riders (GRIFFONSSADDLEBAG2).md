# Wind Riders
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Wind-Riders.webp#right)  


These boots look and feel like pale, dried leaves but are remarkably soft and quiet to walk in. While wearing these boots, you can move normally in difficult terrain caused by strong winds.

While wearing these boots, you can use an action to speak their command word to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gaseous Form.md\|gaseous form]] spell, transforming yourself into a swirling cloud of vapor and leaves. This version of the spell lasts for up to 1 minute, but only allows you to float vertically using your movement speed. Your horizontal movement speed while in this form is decided by the direction and speed of the wind. A wind of light speed (between 5 and 10 miles per hour) propels you 10 feet per round, whereas a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) pushes you 20 feet instead.

Traveling somewhere while in this form where the swirling leaves are unable to follow you ends the effect early. Once the boots have been used to cast this spell, they can't do so again until the next dawn.
