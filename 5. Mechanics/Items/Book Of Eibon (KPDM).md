# Book of Eibon
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  


This fragmentary black book is reputed to descend from forgotten realms of Hyperborea. It contains puzzling guidelines for frightful necromantic rituals and maddening interdimensional travel.

The book contains the following spells: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Semblance Of Dread (KPDM).md\|semblance of dread]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ectoplasm (KPDM).md\|ectoplasm]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animate Dead.md\|animate dead]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Dead.md\|speak with dead]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Emanation Of Yoth (KPDM).md\|emanation of Yoth]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Green Decay (KPDM).md\|green decay]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Yellow Sign (KPDM).md\|yellow sign]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Eldritch Communion (KPDM).md\|eldritch communion]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Undead.md\|create undead]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Gate.md\|gate]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Harm.md\|harm]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Astral Projection.md\|astral projection]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Void Rift (KPDM).md\|Void rift]], and any additional spells of the GM's choosing.

If attuned to it, the book's owner can use it as a spellbook and as an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the book, an attuned owner can use a bonus action to cast a necromancy spell that is written in this tome without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic components. Once used, this property of the book can't be used again until the next dawn.
