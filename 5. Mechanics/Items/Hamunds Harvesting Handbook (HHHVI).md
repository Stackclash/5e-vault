> Yes, you can own a copy of this very book in any plane you visit! Due to my travels, I have visited almost every world in the multiverse, dropping manuscripts in publishers' hands as I go. No matter where you are, or where you come from, this handy book is sure to help you get the most out of whatever your local fauna has to offer.

This book is filled with all sorts of useful information on the creatures that inhabit the multiverse, specifically, which parts of them are useful for harvesting. Using this book grants you advantage on any "Appraise" ability check.
