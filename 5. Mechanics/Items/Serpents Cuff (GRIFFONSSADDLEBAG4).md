# Serpent's Cuff
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Serpents-Cuff.webp#right)  


While wearing this brass ear cuff, you can understand the literal meaning of what snakes say to you, as if by the speak with animals spell, although you have no special ability to speak to them in return. In addition, a tiny, bell-like rattle sits at the end of the snake's tail; it chimes softly in your ear to alert you whenever there's a snake or similar serpentine creatures within 60 feet of you.

If you're [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] while wearing the cuff, you can use an action to clamp its snake mouth down on your ear using a free hand. You take 1 piercing damage from the snake bite, and the poison is neutralized. If you're afflicted by more than one poison, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
