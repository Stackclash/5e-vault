# Bane Shield
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Bane-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This classic iron shield is emblazoned with the skulllike face of a demon. The shield has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you while holding this shield, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to curse that creature. The next time that creature makes an ability check or attack roll before the end of its next turn, it must roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from the total.
