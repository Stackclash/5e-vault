# Winterlight Bloom
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

Adventurers say that while deserts have oases, snowfields have winterlight bloom. This majestic plant features a powder blue flower that resembles a lotus. Each petal is thick and contains a salt compound that when added to water (such as snow), causes a chemical reaction that creates a very pleasant and long lasting source of heat. This adaptation allows the winterlight bloom to both process saltier environments and to also clear away snow from its surroundings so that its seeds can reach the soil when they drop.

## Effect:

You gain resistance to cold damage for 4 hours after using this herb.
