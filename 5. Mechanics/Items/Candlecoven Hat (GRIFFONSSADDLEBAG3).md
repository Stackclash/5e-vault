# Candlecoven Hat
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Candlecoven-Hat.webp#right)  


This pointed mage hat is weighed down and stiffened by the solidified wax of 7 candles set atop it. The candles are harmless, require no oxygen, and emit dim light in a 10-foot radius while lit. While wearing the hat, you can use a bonus action to mentally light or extinguish the candles, up to the maximum amount. The candles can only be lit in this way. The maximum number of candles that can be lit depends on the number of times you've used the following property of the hat.

If a creature that you can see is cursed by you, such as by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]] spell or other feature or property that uses "curse" in its name or description, you can use a bonus action to magically ignite that creature. You must be wearing the hat, and its candles must be lit. Each time you do, one of the candles on the hat is extinguished and can't be relit until the next dusk. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, taking `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature is affected by a curse that causes it to take extra damage from attacks, this fire damage also triggers that extra damage on a failed save.

Alternatively, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dancing Lights.md\|dancing lights]] spell from the hat while wearing it. The maximum number of lights you can create with this version of the spell is equal to the number of lit candles atop the hat, up to seven. By combining all seven of these lights, you can create a vaguely humanoid form of Large size, or one of Medium size with six or fewer.
