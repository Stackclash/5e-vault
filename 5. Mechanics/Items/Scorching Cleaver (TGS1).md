- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This battleaxe has 8 charges and regains `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) expended charges each day at dawn. As long as the weapon has at least 1 charge, attacks you make with it deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage to any target it hits. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it regains 3 expended charges.

## Erupting Slash

As an action, you can expend 3 or more of the battleaxe's charges to slash the air in front you. When you do, a line of fire 30 feet long and 5 feet wide erupts from the blade. Creatures within the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage for each expended charge. If you expend 4 or more charges in this way and leave the battleaxe with 0 remaining charges, the weapon overheats. When it overheats, targets within the line take an extra `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) fire damage, and creatures that succeed on the Dexterity saving throw take half damage instead of avoiding the effect. The DC for this property's saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the number of charges you expend.
