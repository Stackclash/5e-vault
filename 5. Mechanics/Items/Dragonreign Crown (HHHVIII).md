# Dragonreign Crown
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this crown, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]) and Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) checks.  
- Whenever a creature with the type "dragon" attempts to do something that would directly result in damage to you, they must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature must choose a different action instead that does not directly result in damage to you, wasting their action if they do not.  
- As an action, you may choose up to four of your allies within 60 feet of you that you can see. Until the start of your next turn, those allies make attack rolls with advantage and can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]].  
- As an action, you may force all creatures of your choice within 120 feet of you and can see you to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.  
- As an action you may target one dragon you can see within 120 feet of you, forcing them to make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. If they are a chromatic dragon, they make this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to this ability for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 hour. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, the target regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if you or your allies deal damage to the target. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.
