# Goblin Effigy
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This basic cloth doll is woven from long strands of barghest fur and resembles a caricature of a goblin. When you speak the command word within 10 feet of this doll, it grows into a semi-aware goblin whose basic appearance you choose. This goblin superficially resembles a goblin but is unable to speak, communicate meaningfully, or change its emotions from anything but a blank stare. It has a walking speed of 10 feet, a Strength and Dexterity score of 8, an AC score of 9, and 6 hit points. It is unable to take any actions except for the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]], and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Use%20an%20Object\|Use an Object]] actions. The goblin is loyal to whoever spoke its command word and does its best to follow their orders. After 1 hour, or if it is reduced to 0 hit points, the goblin reverts back to its doll form. Once this has occurred, the doll cannot transform into its goblin form again for another 24 hours.
