# Harbinger's Flail
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Flail.md\|flail]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Harbingers-Flail.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This whip-like chain flail's head is a sonorous bell from the Temple of Twin Fates, a holy site known for its grim foretellings. This weapon has the reach property and deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) thunder damage to any target it hits. When it hits a target, the bell releases a deep sound that's audible out to 100 feet.
