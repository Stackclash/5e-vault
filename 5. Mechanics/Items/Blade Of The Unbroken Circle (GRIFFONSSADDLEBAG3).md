# Blade of the Unbroken Circle
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Longsword.md\|longsword]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Blade-of-the-Unbroken-Circle.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This blade is made by archdruids from the branch of an ancient tree. Rejuvenating magic pulses through it. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you're a druid, you're proficient with this weapon, which can also be used as a druidic focus, and the bonus increases to +3.

While attuned to the weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength, for its attack and damage rolls. In addition, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

## Charges

This sword has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you're a druid, it regains all expended charges at dawn instead.

## Spells

While holding the sword, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 17): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Barkskin.md\|barkskin]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plant Growth.md\|plant growth]] (3 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Regenerate.md\|regenerate]] (7 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Tree Stride.md\|tree stride]] (5 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Thorns.md\|wall of thorns]] (6 charges). If you're a druid, this version of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Barkskin.md\|barkskin]] spell prevents your AC from being less than 18, instead of 16.

## Nature's Wrath

When you hit a target with the sword, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) damage to it of a type based on the environment you're in. If an environment has more than one damage type associated with it, you choose which one each time: arctic (cold), coast (cold or fire), desert (fire), forest (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), grassland (piercing or slashing), mountain (lightning), swamp (necrotic or poison), or underground (necrotic).
