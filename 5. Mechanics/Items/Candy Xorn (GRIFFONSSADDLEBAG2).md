# Candy Xorn
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Candy-Xorn.webp#right)  


Candy xorn is a round, waxy candy that typically comes in small bags of `dice:2d6+3|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 3`) pieces. Each piece is traditionally either orange or yellow, but always has a narrow, reptilian pupil drawn at its center. Eating a candy xorn causes your eyes to turn orange or yellow (your choice), and your pupils to match the ones found on the piece of candy. After 1 minute, the effect ends and your eyes return to normal.

In addition, each piece of candy xorn has a 5 percent chance to not be candy at all, but actually a gemstone covered in the sugared coating. When you find a gemstone in this way, it can be either [[5. Mechanics/Items/Eye Agate.md\|eye agate]] (40%, 10 gp), [[5. Mechanics/Items/Tiger Eye.md\|tiger's eye]] (40%, 10 gp), or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Amber.md\|amber]] (20%, 100 gp).
