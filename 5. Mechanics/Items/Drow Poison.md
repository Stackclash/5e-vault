# Drow Poison
*Adventuring gear, poison (injury)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Poison\|Poison]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

This poison is typically made only by the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Drow.md\|drow]], and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] while [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
