# Potion of Stamina
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you gain a sense of inner strength and vitality. For the next 24 hours, whenever you roll a saving throw to resist an effect that causes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]], you may make that roll at advantage. This potion is a bright blue with what looks like electricity running through it occasionally.
