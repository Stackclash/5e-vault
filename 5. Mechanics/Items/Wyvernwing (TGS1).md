This enchanted greatsword contains a wyvern's wing that's stretched between three thin, collapsed blades. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The sword has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) expended charges each day at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to flick open the sword like a fan and swing it down to create a buffeting wind. When you do, you can choose for the wind to affect creatures in either a 15-foot cone in front of you or all creatures within 5 feet of you. Creatures affected by this wind in the area you designate are forced to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't pushed. The weapon magically collapses again as the wind settles.
