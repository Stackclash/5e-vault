# Elixir of Health
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
