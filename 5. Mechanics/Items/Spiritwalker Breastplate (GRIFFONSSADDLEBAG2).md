# Spiritwalker Breastplate
*Medium armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Breastplate.md\|breastplate]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Spiritwalker-Breastplate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this armor, your spirit leaves your body and appears as a floating, ghostly version of yourself. The spirit remains there for 1 minute or until you regain consciousness, at which point the spirit returns to your body. For the duration, you don't suffer a death saving throw failure as a result of taking damage, and you can only die from damage if the total damage you take on a turn equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. You still make death saving throws at the start of each of your turns while in this state; however, the number you must roll to succeed on a death saving throw increases by 1 for every 5 feet away from your physical body your spirit is at the start of each of your turns.

Your spirit is tethered to your physical body and can't be farther than 30 feet away from it at any time. The spirit has your senses, a flying speed of 30 feet, and can hover. On your turn, it can only move and take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Help\|Help]] action. The spirit is immune to all damage and is incorporeal, but an effect that turns undead will automatically send your spirit back to your physical body and end the effect early.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
