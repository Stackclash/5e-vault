# Planar Rapier
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Rapier.md\|rapier]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Planar-Rapier.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 piercing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This thin blade seems to toe the line between planes of existence, occasionally allowing it to bend them to extend beyond its normal reach. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The rapier has 5 charges and regains `dice:1d4+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges each day at dawn. You can expend 1 charge to extend the reach of a melee attack you make with the rapier to 10 feet instead of 5. You can expend this charge either before or after you make the attack. If you expend the charge after making a melee attack with the rapier against a target within 5 feet of you, you can extend the rapier to immediately pierce through the original target and make a bonus melee attack against a different target 5 feet behind the original one, provided that the second target is still within 10 feet of you. This bonus attack is considered to be part of the initial attack. The second target does not benefit from using the original one as cover. Whenever you expend a charge with this weapon, the planes around the blade begin to tear, causing any target hit by an attack with the extended blade to take an extra `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) force damage.

After the attack, the blade returns to its normal size.
