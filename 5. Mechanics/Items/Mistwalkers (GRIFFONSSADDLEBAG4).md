# Mistwalkers
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

Your walking speed is increased by 10 feet while wearing these boots. While in fog, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed; you move through the air as if you're walking.

Once on each of your turns when you walk 30 or more feet on the ground in a straight line, you can immediately cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Misty Step.md\|misty step]] spell from the boots (no action required). When you do, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you that's along the same straight line and in the same direction in which you were moving. This property of the boots can be used four times. The boots regain one use of this property for every hour they aren't used to teleport.
