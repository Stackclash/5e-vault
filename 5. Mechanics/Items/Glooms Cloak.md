# Gloom's Cloak
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A rather grim-looking species of ivy that is pitch black in colour and covered in tiny hairs on each leaf that make it appear as if a living darkness is growing across any cave wall that it clings to. This herb's incredible adaptation to cave existence allows it to absorb any miniscule amount of light and trap it within itself, allowing none of it to escape and wasting none of it at all.

## Effect:

You gain resistance to radiant damage for the next 4 hours after using this herb.
