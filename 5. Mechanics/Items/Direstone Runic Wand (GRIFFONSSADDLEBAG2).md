# Direstone Runic Wand
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Direstone-Runic-Wand.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A rigid stone wand used by the arcane dwarves of the Direstone mines. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to trace one of the following runes in the air to invoke its properties (spell save DC 15):

## Algiz

You can expend 3 charges to grant 1 creature you can see within 10 feet of you resistance to fire damage for 1 hour.

## Eihwaz

You can expend 2 charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Arcane Lock.md\|arcane lock]] spell. When you use this spell to lock a second object, the spell ends on the first one.

## Hagalaz

You can expend 2 charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shatter.md\|shatter]] spell.

## Kenaz

You can expend 1 charge to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Burning Hands.md\|burning hands]] spell, or 2 charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Heat Met(AL).md\|heat metal]] spell.

## Raidho

You can expend 4 charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stone Shape.md\|stone shape]] spell. This version of the spell can alter the form of either stone or natural metal (such as iron or silver).

Alternatively, you can use the wand to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Illusory Script.md\|illusory script]] spell over the course of 1 minute by expending 1 of its charges, but can only use it to write on stone or metal surfaces.

The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into stone dust. If you are not a [[5. Mechanics/Races/Dwarf.md\|dwarf]] when this happens, you must also succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]] until freed by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell or similar magic.
