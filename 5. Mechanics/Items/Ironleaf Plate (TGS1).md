# Ironleaf Plate
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ironleaf-Plate.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This set of armor gives you a +1 bonus to your AC and is lined with ironleaf vines. While wearing this armor, the vines seem to support and quiet its normally loud movements, allowing you to make Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks without disadvantage. In addition, the vines dampen the impact you receive from blunt force, granting you resistance to bludgeoning damage.

If you take fire damage, the leaves wither for 1 minute. While the leaves are withered, you gain none of their benefits.

## Mantle of the Wild

While wearing this armor, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Pass Without Trace.md\|pass without trace]] spell from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the following dawn.
