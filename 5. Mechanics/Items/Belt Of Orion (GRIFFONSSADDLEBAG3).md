# Belt of Orion
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Belt-of-Orion.webp#right)  


While wearing this belt, you have advantage on any ability check made to track a beast or monstrosity. In addition, when you hit a beast or monstrosity with a weapon attack, you deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage of the weapon's type.

## Summon Hounds

You can use an action while wearing this belt to summon two [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Mastiff.md\|mastiff]]s, which appear in unoccupied spaces of your choice within 10 feet of you. The mastiffs are friendly to you and your companions, and take their turns immediately after you. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. Each mastiff remains for 1 hour or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. While at least one mastiff remains, you gain a +5 bonus on any ability check made to track a creature. Once this property of the belt has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
