# Crystal Fruit
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

An icy-blue fruit that well deserves its name. This curious fruit has an incredibly strange adaptation in that its juice freezes any creature that drinks it. Ostensibly, its purpose is to freeze any insects that attempt to eat it once it blooms at the start of the winter months. Once the snows thaw, the frozen insects are released and have free reign to spread the fruit's pollen far and wide, free from competition. That said, the fruit's freezing effect is mostly designed to be used on insects, and although it will still encase any creature that eats it in ice, it won't have nearly the same potency on anything larger than a mouse.

## Effect:

You may use your action to eat this fruit. If you do so, for the next 10 minutes your body becomes coated in a thin layer of ice that raises your AC to 15 if it was lower than that before, but your movement speed is halved.
