![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Gladius-of-the-Everfighter.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 P
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This worn gladius has been used by numerous famed warriors over centuries. When swung, the sound of a valiant battlecry can be faintly heard. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding this weapon, you gain an additional use of your Second Wind and Action Surge class features, but can use Action Surge only once on a turn.

As an action, you can speak the weapon's command word to transform it into a different **simple or martial melee weapon** of your choice. When you do, the weapon glimmers with a golden sheen and becomes mutable, allowing you to use a bonus action to mentally change the weapon's form again for the duration. The weapon remains mutable for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to end the effect early. It reverts to its normal form when it's no longer mutable.

While the gladius is transformed into a weapon with the thrown property, it flies back to your hand immediately after you make a ranged attack with it.

## Sentience

The gladius of the everfighter is a sentient weapon of lawful neutral alignment with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a stern and commanding voice.

## Personality

The gladius of the everfighter is sworn to do battle for eternity. It grows tired of diplomacy quickly and believes that disputes are best settled through combat, either lethal or otherwise. It only finds comradery with its wielder after overcoming a powerful adversary together. It strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time, preferring instead to search out new tests of strength.

If the gladius enjoys a fight that would normally end in the death of the opposing creature, it can choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it.
