# Instrument of Harmony
*Wondrous item, instrument, rare (requires attunement by a character with proficiency in at least one stringed instrument)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

The notes played on an instrument strung with unicorn hair are reminiscent of the sound of wind whistling through the branches of an ancient forest. You can use an action to play this instrument in a performance that lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, any friendly creature who can hear your performance may reroll any 1s or 2s rolled when they recover hit points in any way. Creatures that do so must use the new result, even if it is a 1 or a 2.
