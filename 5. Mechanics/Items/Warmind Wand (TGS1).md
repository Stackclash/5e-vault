# Warmind Wand
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a half-orc or orc)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Warmind-Wand.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand is made from the shattered hilt and jawbone of a defeated warband leader. It has 7 charges for the following properties and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand releases a small gasp of breath as its magic escapes it, leaving the wand a nonmagical and mundane sword hilt.

While holding the wand, you can use it to command and bolster your allies by extending 1 or more of its charges to use the following properties:

## Warband Strike

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, you can forgo one of your attacks and expend 1 charge as a bonus action to direct one of your allies to attack. When you do, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.

## Form Ranks

You can expend 1 charge as an action to command one of your allies to move to a more advantageous position and bolster their resolve. When you do, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains `dice:2d4+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4 + 2`) temporary hit points that last for 1 minute and can use its reaction to move up to half its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

## Forced Endurance

When a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that can see or hear you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and expend 2 charges to prevent that creature from falling [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] and drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property has been used on a creature, that creature can't benefit from it again until it finishes a long rest.

## Unyielding Critical

When a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that can see or hear you scores a critical hit, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to amplify the brutality of the attack and add an extra `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) damage to the total of the attack's damage roll.
