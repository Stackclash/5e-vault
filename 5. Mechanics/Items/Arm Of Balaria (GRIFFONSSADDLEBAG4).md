# Arm of Balaria
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), uncommon (requires attunement by a monk)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Arm-of-Balaria.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

The ends of this quarterstaff are topped with brass hands. Whenever you would make an unarmed strike, you can make a special attack with the weapon instead; this special attack counts as an unarmed strike and uses the damage die for your unarmed strikes as normal. When you make this special attack using the quarterstaff, your reach with the weapon is increased by 5 feet.

The staff's hands can change into different positions or gestures. Each position allows you to change your unarmed strike's damage type with it: bludgeoning damage (clenched fist), piercing damage (finger point), or slashing damage (hand chop). Whenever you make an unarmed strike with the staff, you can change the gesture of the respective hand as part of the attack.
