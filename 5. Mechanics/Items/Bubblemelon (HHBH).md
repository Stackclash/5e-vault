# Bubblemelon
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

This plum-sized melon can be found buried under the sand in the shallows of a coast and is identifiable by looking for the telltale bubbles that it emits from the sand during low tide. It is believed that these fruits were created by some sea god as a method of bridging the divide between land and sea dwellers; indeed, it has the incredibly useful ability to release breathable oxygen when it is chewed, allowing the non-aquatic races to venture beneath the depths (at least temporarily).

## Effect:

As an action you may begin chewing this herb. As long as you continue chewing this root, you do not need to breathe. This herb may be chewed for up to 10 minutes, which you may do all at once or over several sessions.
