# Foxfire Charm
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Foxfire-Charm.webp#right)  


This ebony charm is decoratively shaped into a fox's head and is always slightly warm to the touch. It measures 4 inches across and weighs 1/2 pound. If the charm is placed in a sufficiently hot fire, such as in a campfire, forge, or oven that fills up to a 10-foot cube, the charm begins to glow red-hot and creates a harmless, but comfortably warm, fire elemental in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fire. The elemental is in the form of a fox and can't move farther than 100 feet from the fire in which its charm is kept. The elemental's singular goal is to supply this fire with fuel. If the fire begins to burn out, the elemental will search the surrounding area for fuel that isn't being worn or carried.

The fox uses the statistics for a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Cat.md\|cat]], except that it's an elemental instead of a beast, is immune to fire and poison damage, and understands Common and Ignan but can't speak. The elemental has advantage on ability checks to find fuel for its source fire and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. It can carry fuel back to the fire as normal, provided that it's appropriate to the elemental's size. If the elemental drops to 0 hit points, touches fire, or its source fire goes out, it vanishes and the charm grows cold and dark again until it's placed in a new fire.
