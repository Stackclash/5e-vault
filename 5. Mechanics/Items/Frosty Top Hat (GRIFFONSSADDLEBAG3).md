# Frosty Top Hat
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Frosty-Top-Hat.webp#right)  


A light dusting of snow covers the brim of this bent and beaten top hat. While wearing it, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.

As an action, you can speak the hat's command word and throw it into an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. When you do, a snowman magically appears from below the hat. Its body is made from three stacked spheres of snow, two arms made of forked branches, and pieces of coal in place of its eyes and mouth. The snowman uses the ice mephit's statistics with the following changes:

The snowman understands Common but can't speak.

The snowman is a Medium creature, instead of Small, and can't fly. It moves by rolling its bottom-most snow sphere like a wheel.

While the snowman remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary snowman.

The snowman obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you) and takes its turn immediately after yours. If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The snowman remains for 1 hour, until it dies, or until you use an action to speak its command word again, at which point it crumbles to powdery snow. Once this property of the hat has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
