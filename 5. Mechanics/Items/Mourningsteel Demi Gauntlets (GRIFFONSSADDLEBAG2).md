# Mourningsteel Demi-Gauntlets
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Mourningsteel-Demi-Gauntlets.webp#right)  


This pair of dark, open-fingered gauntlets are made from mourningsteel, a metal whose ore has been steeped in the blood of countless fallen creatures. While wearing the gauntlets, you have resistance to necrotic damage.

The gauntlets have 12 charges and regain `dice:1d6+6|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 6`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the gauntlets, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from them using a spell attack bonus of +8: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] (no charges, or 1 to cast at 5th level), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|inflict wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] (3 charges). Damage dealt by these spells ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

In addition, if you spend a charge to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] from the gauntlets and hit a creature, you can immediately choose to expend additional charges to cast either the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|inflict wounds]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] spell from them as part of the action to cast the cantrip. When you do, the cantrip's skeletal hand delivers the spell to the target, instead of requiring you to touch it. If you were already concentrating on the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] spell when you hit a creature with [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] in this way (after spending a charge to cast it), you don't need to expend any additional charges to deliver your [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] spell to the target. Necrotic damage dealt by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] doesn't count toward the amount dealt by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vampiric Touch.md\|vampiric touch]] for the purpose of calculating the number of hit points you regain from the spell.
