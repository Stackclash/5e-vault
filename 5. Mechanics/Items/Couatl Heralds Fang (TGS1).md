# Couatl Herald's Fang
*Major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Couatl-Heralds-Fang.webp#right)  


This vibrant sword carries with it some of the properties of the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Couatl.md\|couatl]] who either forged it or the couatl whose scales it was crafted from. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] and has a speed of 0 until it takes any damage or someone else uses an action to shake the target out of its stupor.

## Flight of the Couatls

While you're attuned to 3 items with this property, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, your flying speed increases by 30 feet instead.
