# Dream Catcher
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Net.md\|net]]), major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Dream-Catcher.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Special%20Weapons\|special]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This circular net is stylized with large white feathers around its edge. Unlike a normal net, the dream catcher can restrain a formless creature such as a ghost or water elemental. The net is immune to slashing damage, and it requires a DC 16 Strength check, instead of DC 10, to free a creature from the net.

The net has 8 charges, which are represented by the number of feathers around the net. When you throw the net, you can speak its command word to expend up to 4 of its charges. If the net hits and restrains a creature, that creature is also affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Sleep.md\|sleep]] spell. The spell targets only the creature within the net, and its spell level is equal to the number of charges expended from the net when it was thrown. If a creature falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] as a result of this effect, it can't be woken up early until the net is removed.

When you expend a charge, one of the feathers disappears in a dream-like cloud of smoke. The net regains `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) expended charges daily at dawn.
