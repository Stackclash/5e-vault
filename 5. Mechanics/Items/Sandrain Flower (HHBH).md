# Sandrain Flower
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

A flower with burnished orange petals, whose beauty belies its rather sinister nature. In order to survive in the arid desert environment, the sandtrap ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: sandrain] flower is capable of absorbing all ambient moisture around it, usually decimating its immediate surroundings into a pit of dry, brittle sand. Worse is that the plant is even capable of sapping moisture from any creature that touches the tiny needles on its alluring petals, reducing the hapless victim to a shrivelled husk in a matter of moments.

## Effect:

This herb has 4 charges. As an action, you may wrap this herb's roots around one of your free hands. While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] with this free hand, you may use your bonus action and 1 charge to force that creature to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] as the herb rapidly dehydrates their body. Constructs, undead, and any creature that does not naturally have liquid in its body automatically succeed on this roll. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] creature may make the Constitution saving throw again at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once all charges have been used on this herb, it bursts from gorging on liquid and becomes useless.
