# Whistle of Dog Command
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Whistle-of-Dog-Command.webp#right)  


You can use an action to blow this whistle, which is only audible to dogs and wolves within 300 feet of you. When you do, choose up to four dogs or wolves that you can see that can hear the whistle. Each creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is affected by a special version of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Command.md\|command]] spell, and it must obey your choice of one of the following commands on its next turn:

## Attack

The creature moves up to its speed toward a target of your choice. If the target is within its reach at the end of this movement, the creature then makes a single attack against the target, using either its bite or claws.

## Drop It

The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

## Fetch

The creature uses its action to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] and retrieve an item that it can carry in its mouth, returning with the item to its original space. The object must be within range of the creature's normal movement.

## Roll Over

The creature rolls over and remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] for the turn.

## Sit

The creature drops [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and then ends its turn.

## Speak

The creature releases a loud howl that's audible out to 300 feet. If the creature communicates by howling, you decide the nature of the howl made.

You don't need to speak in order to issue the chosen command. A shapeshifter is only affected by the whistle if it's in a dog or wolf form when the whistle is blown. Once this property of the whistle has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
