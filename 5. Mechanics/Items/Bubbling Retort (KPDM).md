# Bubbling Retort
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  


This long, thin retort is fashioned from smoky yellow glass and is topped with an intricately carved brass stopper.

You can unstopper the retort and fill it with liquid as an action. Once you do so, it spews out multicolored bubbles in a 20-foot radius. The bubbles last for `dice:1d4+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) rounds. While they last, creatures within the radius are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] and the area is heavily obscured to all creatures except those with tremorsense. The liquid in the retort is destroyed in the process with no harmful effect on its surroundings. If any bubbles are popped, they burst with a wet smacking sound but no other effect.
