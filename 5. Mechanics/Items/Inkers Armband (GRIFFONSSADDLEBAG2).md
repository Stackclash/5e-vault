# Inker's Armband
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Inkers-Armband.webp#right)  


This brushed metal bracelet is lined with a magical black ink. The ink only stains skin and slides harmlessly off of clothing. While wearing the bracelet, you can use a bonus action to cause magical tattoos to appear on the arm that's wearing it. The tattoos remain until you remove the bracelet or use a bonus action to end the effect or change their appearance. These tattoos can either be still or magically animated in a slow loop that repeats every 6 seconds. Regardless of the tattoo, the armband only produces black ink.
