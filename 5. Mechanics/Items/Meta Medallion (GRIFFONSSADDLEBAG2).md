# Meta Medallion
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Meta-Medallion.webp#right)  


This small medallion is 1 inch tall and made of a strange metal that contains a mote of pure magic. While wearing the medallion, your understanding of Metamagic expands, granting you one additional Metamagic option of your choice. As long as you continue to wear the medallion, you can change this option when you finish a long rest.
