# Ring of the Koi
*Ring, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Ring-of-the-Koi.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, you can swim up waterfalls; doing so costs 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot you move.

## Hallowed Water

You can perform a special ritual over the course of 10 minutes; doing so requires the ring of the koi and a golden basin worth no less than 100 gp, which must be filled with water. At the end of the ceremony, you drop the ring in the basin. The ring is then destroyed, but duplicates the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hallow.md\|hallow]] spell, centered on the basin of water. This version of the spell uses the Courage option for its extra effect. When a creature finishes a long rest within the spell's area, it gains the benefit of the ring of the koi's other effects for the next 24 hours.
