# Armor of the Stone Citadel
*Heavy armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Plate Armor.md\|plate armor]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Armor-of-the-Stone-Citadel.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This armor is made of stone and reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than 17, instead of 15. Castle-like crenellations run along the tops of the armor's various pieces. While wearing the armor, you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]], and you have a damage threshold of 10. In addition, if you are blocking a friendly creature enough to grant it half cover against an attack or hostile effect, that creature instead has three-quarters cover against it.

## Living Citadel

While wearing the armor, you can use an action to transform into a Huge stone tower. The tower is a 15-foot-square that's 30 feet tall, centered on you. It resembles your head and upper torso, complete with a pair of powerful stone arms. If there isn't space for the tower, you don't transform, and the action (but not the use of this property) is wasted. Your equipment merges into this form when you transform and has no effect for the duration. For the duration, you use your normal senses, but your speed is reduced to 0. While in this form, you gain 100 temporary hit points and have an AC of 18, your damage threshold increases to 20, and you can't be moved or knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. You are also immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form. You remain in this form for up to 8 hours, at which point you return to your normal form. You return to your normal form early if you lose all of these temporary hit points or if you end the effect using an action. While in this form, you can't cast spells, and your normal attacks are replaced by unarmed strikes using your massive stone fists. These unarmed strikes have a reach of 30 feet and deal `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) bludgeoning damage on a hit. You can make two unarmed strike attacks on each of your turns when you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, even if you can normally make more. Alternatively, you can use an action to hurl a boulder from your arm. The boulder is a ranged weapon attack with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. On a hit, it deals `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with these attacks, which use your Strength modifier for their attack and damage rolls.

You can choose to contain any willing or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] creatures that would be in your space when you transform into the tower. Other creatures are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the tower. When you revert to your normal form, any creatures within the tower reappear in the nearest unoccupied space. A door large enough for Medium creatures to enter the tower appears on the ground. Creatures of your choice can open the door easily, but any other creature must make a DC 20 Dexterity check using [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]] or a DC 25 Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) check to open it. The tower has no windows, but has two floors and a staircase connecting them inside.

Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. If you're reduced to 0 temporary hit points and revert to your normal form, it can't be used again until `dice:1d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) days have passed, instead.
