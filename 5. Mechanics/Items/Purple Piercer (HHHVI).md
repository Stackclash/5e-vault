# Purple Piercer
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  


This weapon possesses a wickedly curved head, taken from the stinger of a purple worm. You gain +3 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Once per day, you may use a bonus action to cause the spearhead to secrete purple worm venom. The next time you successfully hit a creature with this weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:12d6|noform|avg` (`12d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
