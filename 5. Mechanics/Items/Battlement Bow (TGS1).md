# Battlement Bow
*Major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Battlement-Bow.webp#right)  


This magic bow is enchanted with passive abjuration protections. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this bow, the bow creates a thin barrier of protective magic that stays between you and that creature until the start of your next turn. If you hit a different creature while protected by this barrier, the barrier moves to defend you against the new target instead. While the barrier is protecting you against a creature in this way, you're considered to have half cover against that creature's ranged attacks and spell effects.
