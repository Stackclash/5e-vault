# Astral Harpoon
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When fired from a [[5. Mechanics/Objects/Ballista.md\|ballista]] or similar firing mechanism, this harpoon has a +3 to attack and damage rolls and deals `dice: 6d10|avg` (`6d10`) piercing damage instead of the normal amount of damage. When firing this destructive harpoon, if you roll a 20 on your attack roll against a non-magical ship, you cause catastrophic hull damage that causes fractures and breakages to compound. For the next minute, the struck ship suffers `dice: 2d10|avg` (`2d10`) piercing damage ^[This is a homebrew addition] at the end of each round.
