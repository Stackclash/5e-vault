# Storm Caller
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  


When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage.

In addition, if you are outside and holding this weapon, you may spend an action to call a lightning bolt from the sky to strike your weapon, forcing every creature other than yourself within 10 feet of you to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they suffer `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) lightning damage, or half that on a success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
