# Harp of Horror
*Wondrous item, instrument, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

You must be proficient with stringed instruments to use this harp. This harp has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to create a horrid, mind-shattering tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears this performance must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of your next turn. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] in this way, a creature's speed is halved and it is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]]. If you wish, you may choose to make all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of this harp for 24 hours. The harp regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you use the last charge, there is a 20 percent chance that the harp crumbles into dust and becomes useless.
