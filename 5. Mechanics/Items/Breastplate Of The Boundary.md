# Breastplate of the Boundary
*Medium Armor, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 14 + DEX (max of +2)
- **Properties**: Crafted by
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

While wearing and attuned to this breastplate, you constantly teeter on the boundary between life and death. You have resistance to necrotic damage, and if you end your turn with 0 hit points, you regain 1 hit point. In addition, you are immune to any spell or ability that would attempt to kill you instantly without dealing damage, instantly reduce you to 0 hit points without dealing damage, or attempt to remove your soul from your body without your consent (except for the curse described below).

## Curse:

Attuning to this armor curses you until you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic which ends your attunement; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, the amount of death saving throw failures required to kill you is reduced by 1. In addition, if you die while wearing this armor, your soul is consumed by the breastplate and is instantly transported to [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus.md\|Orcus]] to do with as he wishes. Your corpse is transformed into a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Devourer.md\|devourer]] on full hit points which is hostile to any creature around it. Resurrection magic automatically fails when cast on you, unless your soul is first removed from [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus.md\|Orcus']] possession, after which a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Resurrection.md\|resurrection]] spell may be cast on your [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Devourer.md\|devourer]] corpse which will transform back into your original body.
