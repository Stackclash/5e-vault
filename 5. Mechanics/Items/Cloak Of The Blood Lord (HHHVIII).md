# Cloak of the Blood Lord
*Wondrous item, cursed item, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/HHH/HHHVIII/CloakoftheBloodLord.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20Artifact\|Crafted Artifact]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

Under the cover of night, the cultists of [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus (MPMM).md\|Orcus]] blanket themselves in thick, leathery cloaks and steal away into graveyards and cellars to do their master's dark bidding. These dark red cloaks are designed to represent the all-encompassing ambitions of [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus (MPMM).md\|Orcus]] to smother the living under his dominion. Among the cultists is the prophecy of the Cloak of the Blood Lord, a garment fashioned from the wings of a defeated [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus (MPMM).md\|Orcus]] and crafted to continue his legacy. The most zealous among his followers even believe that any 'defeat' that [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus (MPMM).md\|Orcus]] may experience is merely a part of his grand scheme to extend his influence and that he is merely biding his time until his body can be reconstituted and his reign to begin anew.

In order to attune to this item, you must wear it from sundown to sunrise while being buried alive under at least 6 feet of soil. Upon the sunrise, you become attuned to this item and your body changes to resemble that of an undead. Your skin becomes extremely pale, your eyes become sunken, and your physique becomes gaunter. You remain in this form so long as you are attuned to this item; if your attunement to this item ends, you revert to your original form immediately.

While attuned to this item, you are immune to necrotic damage and to any effect that would attempt to remove your soul without your permission. In addition, if you are attuned to this item, you automatically succeed the saving throw imposed by attempting to attune to the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of Orc(US).md\|Wand of Orcus]].

## Random Properties

The Cloak of the Blood Lord has the following random properties:

- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Beneficial Properties.md\|major beneficial]] properties  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Beneficial Properties.md\|minor beneficial]] properties  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Major Detrimental Properties.md\|major detrimental]] property  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Artifact Properties Minor Detrimental Properties.md\|minor detrimental]] properties  

## Spellcasting

While wearing the cloak, you can use it to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Undead.md\|create undead]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] spells up to 3 times each. You regain all expended uses upon finishing your next long rest. In addition you may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] spell and the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] cantrip at will as if you were at 17th level. The spell attack bonus for casting these spells using this item is `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)`.

## Master of Undeath

When you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animate Dead.md\|animate dead]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Undead.md\|create undead]] spells, you may choose the level at which that spell is cast, regardless of the spell slot you actually used or the spell slots you have available, and the creatures created by these spells remain under your control indefinitely. Additionally, you can case the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Undead.md\|create undead]] spell even when it isn't night.

## Regalia of the Necrolord

While wearing this cloak, you may use your action to target an undead creature you can see within 60 feet of you that has an Intelligence score of 8 or less, forcing them to make a contested Charisma check against you. If that undead is under the control of another being, they make the contested Charisma check against you instead. Either way, if you succeed, that undead creature comes under your control.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any undead creature you have under your control in this way if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, including those that you created through the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Undead.md\|create undead]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animate Dead.md\|animate dead]] spells, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 1 hour, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 1 hour, you must use this feature on the creature and succeed on the contested Charisma check again before the current hour period ends.

## Flight from Death

As an action, you may transform this cloak into a pair of wings that attach themselves to your back. If you are wearing armor or clothes under the cloak, it passes through them harmlessly. This transformation lasts for up to 1 hour, or until you dismiss them as a bonus action, transforming them back into a cloak. Once you have used this ability once, it cannot be used again until you finish a short rest or until the next time you kill a creature, whichever comes first.

While you have these wings attached, you have a flying speed equal to your walk speed, and anytime that you are subjected to cold, fire, or lightning damage, you may use your reaction to cover yourself with your wings to gain resistance to that damage type until the end of the current turn.

## Curse

When you become attuned to the cloak, you become cursed. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed in this way, you must roll on the [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus (MPMM).md\|Madness of Orcus table]]* ^[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|See the info tab] and gain the corresponding flaw until you finish your next long rest. If you are targeted by an effect that removes a curse such as a [greater restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell, the user of that effect may choose to either end your attunement to this item and end the madness immediately, or they may choose to continue your attunement and simply end your current madness. If they choose the latter, you are still considered cursed and must roll on the table as usual at the end of your next long rest.

## Destroying the Cloak

Destroying the Cloak of the Blood Lord requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of Orc(US).md\|Wand of Orcus]]. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to lifeâ€”no easy task, given the fact that [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus (MPMM).md\|Orcus]] has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded. Bathing the cloak in positive energy causes it to wither and deteriorate, but unless the above conditions are met, the cloak instantly reforms in a random location in the multiverse, usually in proximity to an easily influenced individual, or someone that worships [[4. World Almanac/NPCs/Orcus (MPMM).md\|Orcus]].
