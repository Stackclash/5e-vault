# Rings of Spell Sharing
*Ring, major, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Rings-of-Spell-Sharing.webp#right)  


This pair of purple rings are linked by a magical force. Each ring displays an outstretched hand. One ring's hand looks to be casting a spell from a gemstone, while the other ring's hand levitates a larger gem above it; the former is a Siphoning ring, and the latter is a Channeling ring. Only the Channeling ring can be attuned to.

The ring has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you're wearing the Channeling ring while the other ring is being worn by another willing spellcaster on the same plane of existence as you, you can use an action to expend 1 of the ring's charges to cast a spell from the other creature's known or prepared spells, using your own spell slot, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability to do so. The spell must have a casting time of one action or bonus action, and you must provide any material components required by the spell. If the creature wearing the Siphoning ring is willing, you are magically aware of its known or prepared spells while wearing the Channeling ring.

If the rings have been more than 1 mile away from one another for 24 hours, the Siphoning ring magically appears next to the Channeling ring again.
