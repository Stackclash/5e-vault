# Potion of Winterbite
*Potion, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, your physiology changes entirely and your blood becomes icy cold for `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) hours. During this time, you are immune to cold damage, and any time a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, they suffer `dice: 2d6|avg|noform` (`2d6`) cold damage. This potion is bright blue with frost constantly encasing the glass.
