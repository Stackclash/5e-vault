# Greater Silver Sword
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greatsword.md\|greatsword]]), legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/greater-silver-sword.webp#right]]  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This magic weapon grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold the sword, you have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, you are immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], and you have resistance to psychic damage. In addition, if you score a critical hit with it against a creature's astral body, you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
