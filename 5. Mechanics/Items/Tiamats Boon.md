# Tiamat's Boon
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you first become attuned to this item, choose a damage type from the following: acid, poison, fire, lightning, and cold. You gain resistance to that damage type. You also gain the ability to use your action to release a wave of deadly breath from your mouth. Targets in a 30-foot cone in front of you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, suffering `dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`) damage of the damage type you chose on a failure, or half that on a success. Once this ability has been used, it may not be used again until you finish a long rest. After a long rest, you may choose to switch your chosen damage type to a different one from the list.
