# Ghost Leaf
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

Due to its gossamer thinness and extremely pale colouring, ghost leaf can only grow in areas of extreme shade lest it burn in the open sun. While these properties seem counterintuitive, they actually allow these leaves to absorb the faint traces of spectral energy that are often found in such dark places. As such, whenever you find a gnarled bush with transparent leaves, I would suggest you pick a good bunch of them to harness their power for your own.

## Effect:

For the next hour, whenever you are moving, you become incorporeal, allowing you to move through other creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain, taking `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage if you end your movement inside a solid object. In addition, creatures with the *Incorporeal Movement* trait can not pass through you.
