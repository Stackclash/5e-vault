These two axes are magically bound and count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which return to your open hand after you make a ranged attack with them. If the two axes are separated and you are holding one of them, you can use a bonus action to cause the other one to teleport and reappear in your open hand or at your feet (your choice each time).

When you make an opportunity attack using the axes, you can make two attacks against the provoking creature instead of one, once with each axe.

## Shade

The first axe, named Shade, is made from an inky black metal. Thin plumes of smoke emanate from several small holes found across it. While holding Shade, you can use a bonus action to exude a dark aura, which lasts for 10 minutes or until you use the weapons' Shine property. For the duration, any creature within 10 feet of you that attacks you immediately takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage, as smoke-like blades lash out and strike it in return. In addition, your attacks with Shade and Shine deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage to any target you hit with them. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Shine

The second axe, named Shine, is made from a pale silver metal. Thin rays of light glimmer from a series of small holes found across it. While holding Shine, you can use a bonus action to exude a brilliant aura, which lasts for 10 minutes or until you use the weapons' Shade property. For the duration, any creature within 10 feet of you that attacks you immediately takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage, as blades of pure radiance appear in a flash of light and strike it. In addition, your attacks with Shade and Shine deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) radiant damage to any target you hit with them. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Special Reaction

While holding at least one of the axes, you can use a special reaction when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you is hit with a melee attack. When you do, you immediately teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of the target, and the attacking creature takes a -10 penalty to the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. If you're surrounded by the aura from Shade, the attacker also takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage, or `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage if you're surrounded by the aura from Shine. This special reaction doesn't count towards the normal number of reactions you can take. This property can be used twice, and Shade and Shine regain all expended uses of it daily at dawn.
