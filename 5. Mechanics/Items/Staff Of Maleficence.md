# Staff of Maleficence
*Melee Weapon, legendary, Crafted by (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: Crafted by, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This twisted staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use any of the following abilities:

## Spellcasting

You use the staff to cast any of the following spells using your spell save DC. Spells are cast at their lowest level, but you may increase their level by spending 1 extra charge per increased spell level: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Person.md\|charm person]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Witch Bolt.md\|witch bolt]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Person.md\|hold person]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Enfeeblement.md\|ray of enfeeblement]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] (4 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Person.md\|dominate person]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Geas.md\|geas]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Circle Of Death.md\|circle of death]] (6 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Disintegrate.md\|disintegrate]] (6 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feeblemind.md\|feeblemind]] (8 charges).

## Paralysis

As an action, you expend 3 charges and slam this staff into the ground, releasing a shockwave of atrophic energy that interferes with the motor functions of all creatures around you. All creatures within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Undead and constructs are immune to this effect.

## Extend Dominion

As an action, you expend 4 charges and target one creature within 30 feet that you can see that is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you. Any elapsed duration of that [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charm]] effect is reset as if that creature had just become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you. In addition, until that [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charm]] effect ends, any saving throw that creature makes to end that [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charm]] effect is made at disadvantage.

## Harvest Knowledge

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you dies, you may use your reaction to steal their knowledge for yourself, which you retain for the next 24 hours. Doing so takes a number of charges equal to their Intelligence score minus your own (minimum of 1 charge). While you have their stolen knowledge, you have access to all of their memories, giving you all the languages that they knew and any proficiencies they may have had (except for saving throw proficiencies). In addition, if their Intelligence score was greater than yours, your Intelligence score rises to equal theirs. You do not gain access to any of their spells or abilities through this knowledge.

This staff regains all expended charges at dawn. Whenever you use the last charge, there is a 90% chance chance that this staff disintegrates into feather-like ashes and becomes useless.
