# Telescoping Bladelance
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance.md\|lance]]), minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Telescoping-Bladelance.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 piercing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Special%20Weapons\|special]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This mechanical lance has bladed edges and has the heavy property. You can use a bonus action on your turn to extend or retract the weapon by twisting its handle. The weapon is a normal lance while it's extended. If the lance is retracted, the end of the weapon rests inside the wider, bladed base and is considered to be a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Greatsword.md\|greatsword]] instead. This greatsword deals `dice:1d12|noform|noparens|avg` (`d12`) slashing damage instead of 2d6.

While the weapon is retracted, you can choose to extend it as a bonus action immediately after hitting a target with an attack. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it's pushed 5 feet away from you.

## Special

You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
