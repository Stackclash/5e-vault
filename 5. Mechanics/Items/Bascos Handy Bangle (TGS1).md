# Basco's Handy Bangle
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bascos-Handy-Bangle.webp#right)  


This shiny platinum bangle is inlaid with arcane runes that seem to be written by different hands. Labels can be read behind each of the adorning runes on the inside of the bangle. As an action, you can touch one of the runes and say the command phrase, "I can do this," to gain proficiency in the rune's associated tool for the next 24 hours. The rune glows with arcane energy while in effect. Once a rune is activated in this way, it can't be activated again until `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) days have passed.

There are 10 runes on the bangle that can be activated in this way: [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Supplies.md\|alchemist's supplies]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Carpenters Tools.md\|carpenter's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cooks Utensils.md\|cook's utensils]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Leatherworkers Tools.md\|leatherworker's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Smiths Tools.md\|smith's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Tinkers Tools.md\|tinker's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Musical Instrument.md\|instruments]] ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Drum.md\|drum]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Flute.md\|flute]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lute.md\|lute]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lyre.md\|lyre]]), [[5. Mechanics/Items/Navigators Tools.md\|navigator's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]], and [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Mounts And Vehicles Waterborne Vehicles.md\|vehicles (water)]]. If you're already proficient with any of these tools, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the tool while the rune is active.
