# H'rethi Desperation
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greatsword.md\|greatsword]]), legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Hrethi-Desperation.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

The handle of this blade is all that remains of this old weapon. Its shattered metal blade is overgrown and replaced by sharpened desert glass, which magically radiates with a sweltering heat. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage to any target it hits. If you have one or more levels of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]], the fire damage becomes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`), instead.

You have resistance to fire damage and ignore difficult terrain created by sand while the weapon is on your person. If you have one or more levels of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] and take fire damage, the damage is reduced to 0, but you have a 20 percent chance to gain an additional level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. Once you gain a level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] as a result of taking fire damage, you can't gain another in this way until the start of your next turn.

## Arid Cleave

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action using this weapon, you can replace one of your attacks with a special sweep in front of you. When you do, a cleaving wave of sand cuts through the air in a 30-foot cone, originating from the blade. A creature within the cone must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) slashing damage and `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage, or `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage if you have one or more levels of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. Once this property has been used, it shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it's used again before then, you gain one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. You can use this property once on each of your turns.

Any levels of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] you gain as a result of this weapon's properties are lost after 1 minute.
