# Windrazor
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Longsword.md\|longsword]]), major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Windrazor.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 slashing
  - Two-handed: 1d10 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has the finesse property. The sword has 10 charges and regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the blade, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 17): [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Heroism.md\|heroism]] (1 charge) or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wind Wall.md\|wind wall]] (3 charges). Your spellcasting modifier is +5 when casting *heroism* in this way.

## Air Rend

This weapon can manipulate the air around it to generate blades of wind, delivering devastating slashing attacks from range. When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, you can expend 1 charge to make a special ranged attack with the sword against a target you can see up to 30 feet away. If you have the Extra Attack feature, you can expend 1 or more charges to use this special attack for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.

## Sudden Storm

When you hold the sword and take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and make a melee attack with the sword against that creature. Additionally, if a creature hits you with a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and slash at the projectile, reducing the damage you take by `dice:1d10+5|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d10 + 5`). If you reduce the damage to 0, you destroy the projectile.
