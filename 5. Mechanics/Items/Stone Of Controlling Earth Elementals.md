# Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals.webp#right]]  

- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Earth Element(AL).md\|earth elemental]], as if you had cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Element(AL).md\|conjure elemental]] spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
