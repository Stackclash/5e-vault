# Lightseer's Gaze
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, legendary (requires attunement by a monk)*

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This flourished mask obscures your eyes and magically stays in place while worn. It once belonged to a wise spiritual leader whose name has been lost to time, but was said to have eschewed personal belongings. While wearing the mask and attuned to it, you gain the following benefits:

- You have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] out to a range of 120 feet, and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Truesight\|truesight]] out to a range of 60 feet. You are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blind]] beyond this radius. Despite being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blind]], you can still see the moon, stars, and sun when they're in the sky above you.  
- Your Wisdom score changes to 21. This property has no effect on you if your Wisdom is already 21 or higher without the mask.  
- You have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) checks.  
- You can spend 3 ki points as an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spirit Guardians.md\|spirit guardians]] spell (save DC 16).  
- You can use an action to spend 2 ki points to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] spell (save DC 16). Alternatively, if you speak to a hostile creature for 1 minute, it must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or become indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward, as if affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] spell (no concentration required). If a creature succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it's immune to the effects of this property for 24 hours.  

## Curse

This item is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. You can't remove the mask while cursed in this way. You remain cursed until it's ended by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell or similar magic. When you become cursed, your name remains known to only you but becomes lost to the rest of the universe, at the GM's discretion. You must choose a new name. This new name replaces every instance of your lost name throughout history, and becomes the only known name for you among all creatures who once knew your lost name. While cursed, you take `dice:5d10|noform|avg` (`5d10`) psychic damage whenever you attempt to speak, write, or otherwise share or communicate your lost name. Regardless of how you attempt to share the lost name, it always comes across as your new one.
