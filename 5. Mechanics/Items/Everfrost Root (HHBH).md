# Everfrost Root
*Herb, spellcasting focus, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

Before the shifting of the plates and the formation of the lands, there were roots that spread from ancient trees all across the world. As time passed, these roots died and withered to make room for the new life that would take its place. However, some still remain frozen under snowy tundra. They have spent millennia absorbing the very cold itself, ready to unleash it to any that know how to tap into its strength.

## Effect:

You may use this herb as an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Arcane Foc(US).md\|arcane focus]] when casting your spells. While this herb is your [[5. Mechanics/Items/Arcane Foc(US).md\|arcane focus]], whenever you roll a 1 or a 2 for cold damage that results from a spell you cast, you can reroll that die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
