# Wizards' Bout Top
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wizards-Bout-Top.webp#right)  


This wooden top is a favorite among children in the wizard city of Orostead, who use them in a local favorite game of Wizards' Bout. Many children repaint their tops to fit their personal aesthetic. You can spin the top using an action; roll a `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) and use the table below to determine the illusory effect created by the top. The effects are instantaneous.

`dice: [[Wizards Bout Top (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^illusory-effect]]`

| dice: d8 | Illusory Effect |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | A burst of light flashes, followed by fading sparkles. |
| 2 | Small vines grow up and around the top. |
| 3 | The ground under the top rumbles and cracks, like an earthquake. |
| 4 | A frigid whirlpool encircles the top. |
| 5 | A viper coils around the top and strikes out. |
| 6 | A sharp sound, like a whip, radiates from the top. |
| 7 | A small pillar of flame flares upward from the top. |
| 8 | A swirling breeze stirs around the top. |

To play a game of Wizards' Bout, another creature must also spin a different Wizards' Bout top within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn. When playing Wizard's Bout, a Tiny, illusory wizard appears above each top when it's spun, which then casts a magical spell against the opposing top. Each player has 10 points at the start of a game of Wizards' Bout, which are subsequently lost and gained depending on the tops' effects. You lose when you have 0 points at the start of your turn, or win if you start with 20 points or more. Refer to the table below to determine the top's additional effects when playing a game of Wizards' Bout.

Both players take turns spinning their tops. Each round is called a bout, and the tops' effects are resolved simultaneously at the end of each bout (even if one player spun their top first). Each effect is associated with a unique element. If that element trumps the one rolled by the opposing player, the opposing top's effect is negated.

`dice: [[Wizards Bout Top (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^element-trumps-wizards-bout-effect]]`

| dice: d8 | Element | Trumps | Wizards' Bout Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | Radiant | Thunder, Poison | Roll another d8. On a 1â€“4, the opposing top's effect misses and has no effect; you then gain 2 points. If this trumped the opposing roll, you gain 3 points instead. |
| 2 | Nature | Earth, Radiant | You gain 2 points. If this trumped the opposing roll, the opposing player also loses 1 point. The vines extend to the opposing top, slowing its rotation and causing the next roll made by the player to be reduced by 1d4 (to a minimum of 1). |
| 3 | Earth | Air, Thunder | The opposing player loses 1 point. The next time the opposing player rolls, they roll twice and you choose which result to use. |
| 4 | Water | Fire, Earth | The opposing player loses 1 point, or 3 points if this trumped the opposing roll. |
| 5 | Poison | Water, Nature | The opposing player loses 1 point if this trumped the opposing roll. Otherwise, if the opposing player's roll would cause you to lose points, they also lose the same number of points. |
| 6 | Thunder | Air, Water | The opposing player loses 1 point, or 2 points if this trumped the opposing roll. The next time the opposing player rolls, you choose if the result is either 1 higher or lower than the actual roll; treat 8 as if it were a number lower than 1. |
| 7 | Fire | Nature | The opposing player loses 2 points. If the opposing player also rolls this effect or one that trumps it, you lose 1 point. You lose this point even though its effect is negated by being trumped. |
| 8 | Air | Poison, Fire | The opposing player immediately rolls a second d8; you choose which result to use. If this trumped the opposing roll, the opposing player loses 2 points. If both players roll this effect, nothing happens. |
