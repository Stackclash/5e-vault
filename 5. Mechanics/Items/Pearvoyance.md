# Pearvoyance
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A magical variety of pear identified by its extremely pale yellow colour that borders on a creamy white. Aside from being absolutely delicious, the juice of this herb can be boiled down into a thick, edible paste when placed into a crucible. This paste has a strong religious history with local people, with many claiming that it allows them to see the futureâ€”while others claim that it is merely a hallucinogenic effect. Either way, the sensation is described as quite pleasant.

## Effect:

After using this herb, you receive a brief vision of the future. The details of this vision, including its length, its distance from the present, and even whether it's true or not is at the discretion of your DM. Regardless, you fully believe this vision to be a true and accurate portent of things to come.
