# Potion of Digestion
*Potion, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, for the next 24 hours you become able to digest anything you eat without any negative consequences. Rotten food does not make you ill, and swallowed poisons have no effect on you. Food with no nutritional value will still not contribute to your daily food requirements however. This potion is a dark green color with a sludge consistency and a smell of decomposing food.
