# Ouroboros Wand
*Wand, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Ouroboros-Wand.webp#right)  


This wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Melfs Acid Arrow.md\|acid arrow]] spell from it, using a spell attack bonus of +7. The arrow created by the spell appears as a snake, rather than an arrow. When you expend the last charge from the wand, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand loses its magic and is transformed into a giant constrictor snake that's hostile toward all creatures (including you). On any other result, the wand immediately regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) charges. Each time this happens, the minimum number you have to roll on the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) to transform it into a snake increases by 1, to a maximum of 5; this number returns to 1 daily at dawn.

This version of the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Constrictor Snake.md\|giant constrictor snake]] has twice as many hit points. In addition, any creature that it bites must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d4|noform|avg` (`4d4`) poison damage and becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half as much poison damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].
