# Starmetal Circlet
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Starmetal-Circlet.webp#right)  


This dark metal headpiece grants you a measure of control over nearby metal while you wear it. When another creature that you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack with a weapon made of metal or a piece of metal ammunition, you can use your reaction to influence the result. When you do, roll a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) and add or subtract the number rolled from the attack roll (your choice). You make this choice after the creature makes its attack roll but before the GM says whether the attack hits or misses.

In addition, while wearing the circlet, you can use an action to interact with an object made of metal that isn't being worn or carried or move it up to 15 feet. The object must be within 30 feet of you and weigh no more than 20 pounds.
