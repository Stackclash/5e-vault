# Ring of Ice
*Ring, major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Ring-of-Ice.webp#right)  


This ring is made of magical ice. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Ice.md\|wall of ice]] spell (spell save DC 16).

When cast from the ring, the wall must be in a circle centered on you. The *wall of ice* is 10 feet tall and 1 foot thick.
