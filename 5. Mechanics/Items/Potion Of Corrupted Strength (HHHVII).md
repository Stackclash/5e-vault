# Potion of Corrupted Strength
*Potion, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you grow one size larger and your Strength score increases to 21 for 1 hour if it was lower than that before. At the end of this hour you return to your regular size, and your Strength score returns to normal. This potion is a pale red color that swells and ebbs to the rhythm of an invisible heartbeat.
