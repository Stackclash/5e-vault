# Glove of the Aegis
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Glove-of-the-Aegis.webp#right)  


This glove holds 5 charges and regains `dice:1d3+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d3 + 2`) expended charges each day at dawn. When a target that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend any number of the glove's charges. You add +2 to your AC for the attack for each charge expended in this way, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this ability after the attack has been made but before any damage has been calculated.

The glove's power cannot be used if you are already wielding a shield.
