# Orb of Shielding
*Spellcasting Focus, common (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

An orb of shielding is a polished, spherical chunk of crystal or stone aligned to one of the planes of existence. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this orb as a spellcasting focus.

If you're holding the orb when you take damage of the type associated with the orb's material, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) (to a minimum of 0). The materials and their associated damage types are listed in the Orb of Shielding table.
