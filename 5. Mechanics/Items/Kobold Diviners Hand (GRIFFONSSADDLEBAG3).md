# Kobold Diviner's Hand
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Kobold-Diviners-Hand.webp#right)  


This severed hand of a kobold diviner still twitches on occasion. You can use an action while holding it to speak its command word followed by the name or description of an object, said in Draconic. If one or more of those objects is within 1,000 feet of you, the hand points towards the nearest one with one, two, three, or all four of its fingers. For each finger pointing, the object is within a cumulative 250 feet in the pointed direction. The hand then goes slack and ceases to point.

Once this property of the hand has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
