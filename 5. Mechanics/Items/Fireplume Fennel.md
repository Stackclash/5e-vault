# Fireplume Fennel
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

A beautiful orange-red plant herb that can be found by looking for the distinctive flame shaped stalks that it shoots above the soil. Unlike its more mundane cousin, it is highly recommended that you do not attempt to eat this plant, as it has developed a unique propagation method that causes its bulb to explode upon undergoing sufficient external stress (like that of a bite or simply a very hard landing) and thus spreading its seeds a long distance. However, if you really must know what the plant tastes like, I can confirm (with a very burnt tongue) that it tastes like a mix of cinnamon and cloves.

## Effect:

As an action, you may throw this herb at a space within 20 feet of you that you can see. Upon landing, this herb explodes, forcing all targets within 5 feet of that space to succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer `dice: 2d6|avg|noform` (`2d6`) fire damage, or half that on a successful save.
