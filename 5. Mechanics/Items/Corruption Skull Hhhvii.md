# Corruption Skull
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

While holding this skull, you may use it to cast the message spell without using any components.

Once per day, when you cast message in this way, you may also choose to force your target to succeed a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by you for the next 24 hours. While charmed in this way, their alignment changes to evil, and any Persuasion (Charisma) checks you make to convince them to perform an evil act is rolled at advantage. The charm ends after 24 hours, or if you do anything to directly harm the charmed creature.
