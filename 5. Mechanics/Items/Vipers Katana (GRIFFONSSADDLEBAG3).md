- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S
  - Two-handed: 1d10 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]

This menacing curved blade is detailed with hundreds of metallic scales and has a serpentine hilt. When you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) poison damage. This weapon has the finesse property.

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to deal no damage to it. You make this decision after determining that the attack hits, but before rolling the damage for it. Instead, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of its next turn. If the target was surprised, it has disadvantage on this saving throw. When the poison ends, the creature takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) piercing damage and `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) poison damage, as if a great serpent had suddenly struck it. Once a creature has been [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, it automatically succeeds on its saving throw against this property for the next 24 hours.
