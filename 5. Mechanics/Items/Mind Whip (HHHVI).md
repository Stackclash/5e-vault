# Mind Whip
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Whip.md\|whip]]), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

When you make a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check, you may choose to do so with this whip instead of using your free hand. If you do so and if you succeed on the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check, you may force the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] creature to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, this whip may not be used to attack another target. Once this ability has been used 4 times in a day, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
