# Potion of Growth
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|enlarge/reduce]] spell for `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) hours (no [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#concentration\|concentration]] required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
