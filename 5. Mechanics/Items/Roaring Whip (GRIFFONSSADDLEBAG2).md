# Roaring Whip
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Whip.md\|whip]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Roaring-Whip.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Reach\|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This magic whip releases a thunderous burst of sound from it when snapped that can damage faraway targets with its ferocity.

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action while holding this whip, you can use it to attack a target that's up to 5 feet outside your normal reach with the weapon. On a hit, the weapon's damage die changes to a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) and deals thunder damage instead of slashing damage. Hit or miss, it emits the sound of a roaring lion audible out to 100 feet.
