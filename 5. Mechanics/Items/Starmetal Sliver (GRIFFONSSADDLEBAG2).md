This slim blade was forged using strange, unearthly metals from a meteorite. When you use an action to toss this magic dagger into the air, it orbits your body at a distance of `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) feet. Another creature can use an action to grasp the dagger to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check. You can use an action to seize and either wield or stow the dagger.

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action while the dagger is orbiting you, you can use a bonus action to cause the dagger to attack a target within 10 feet of you. The dagger uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls. Immediately after the attack, the dagger returns to orbit you.

In addition, the dagger creates a small gravitational field that wards off harm. While the dagger orbits you, when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by `dice:1d10+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d10 + 4`). If the damage is reduced to 0, the missile slows to a stop without hitting you and falls to the ground at your feet.
