# Drowner's Pearl
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Drowners-Pearl.webp#right)  


This magic, sickly pearl contains a fragment of life absorbed from a body that sank to the bottom of the sea. While holding this pearl in your mouth, you can survive for 1 additional minute before you suffocate when you run out of breath or begin to choke underwater. Once this property has been used, the pearl turns to dust and is destroyed.
