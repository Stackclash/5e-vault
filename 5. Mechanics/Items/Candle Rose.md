# Candle Rose
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

A wonderfully droll flower thought to have been invented in the courts of the Feywild by a druid attempting to win a fey queen's favour (they were apparently successful). This rose grows a naturally waxy cuticle around its flower petals, and when the tips are set alight, this wax melts much like a candle's would. Altogether, this rose is essentially usable as an ordinary candle, but with the added benefit of both looking and smelling fantastic. Other varieties have been grown as well, leading to a range of colours and fragrances. They can be rather expensive for common folk however, so they are usually only brought out when celebrating a valued guest.

## Effect:

This foot-long herb may be used in the same manner as an ordinary [[5. Mechanics/Items/Candle.md\|candle]]: for 1 hour when lit, it sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. The fragrance and colour of this rose is determined by your DM, but they are usually both quite pleasant.
