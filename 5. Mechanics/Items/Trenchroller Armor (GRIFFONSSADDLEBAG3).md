# Trenchroller Armor
*Major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Trenchroller-Armor.webp#right)  


This heavy, rounded armor is marked by a glowing crystal at its center. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. As a bonus action, you can transform into a 2-foot-diameter metallic sphere. Your equipment melds into the new form. While transformed, your size is Small, and opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage. Your senses are unaffected while in this form, although you don't need to breathe for the duration. Your AC also remains the same, but you can only take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]], Disengage, or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dodge\|Dodge]] action. You can use a bonus action to take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action while transformed.

You can remain in this form for up to 1 hour, until you drop to 0 hit points, or until you use a bonus action to return to your normal form. Deduct a minimum of 1 minute from the armor's total transformation time each time you transform, even if you aren't transformed for the full minute. The armor regains all of its expended transformation time daily at dawn.
