# Phoenix Arrow (Generic)
*Major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Phoenix-Arrow.webp#right)  


This bolt or arrow is fletched with [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Phoenix (MPMM).md\|phoenix]] feathers and is magically bound to a small [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quiver.md\|quiver]]. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. Once fired, the ammunition bursts into flames upon impact and deals fire damage instead of piercing. At the start of your next turn, the arrow leaves behind a small pile of ash and reappears in its quiver.

You can speak the ammunition's command word as a bonus action before firing it to set it ablaze. If you fire it on that same turn, the arrow or bolt deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) fire damage to any target it hits, but turns to ash before reaching its target if fired at a target more than 30 feet away. The arrow reappears in its quiver immediately after making this attack.

You can store up to 10 other arrows in the quiver but can only have 1 Phoenix Arrow bound to it at a time. If the arrow is ever destroyed, it reappears in the quiver after 24 hours. Firing the arrow or bolt into an antimagic field renders it nonmagical while within the field, allowing the ammunition to be permanently destroyed.
