# Creeper's Folly
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A type of ivy distinguishable by its spindly forked leaves that resemble that of sharp, tiny hands. Despite its off-putting appearance, these leaves contain a powerful stimulant that when brewed into a tea, raises one's awareness of the world around them while also keeping them calm in the tensest of situations. Among spelunkers, finding a vine of these leaves at the entrance of a new cave is considered a good omen, and it is tradition for them to drink a cup of it to protect them from ambushes by the dark denizens they are sure to  meet.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you cannot be surprised and you make all initiative rolls at advantage.
