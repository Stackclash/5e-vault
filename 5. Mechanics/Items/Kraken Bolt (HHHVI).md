# Kraken Bolt
*Ammunition, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This several-foot-long bolt is designed to be loaded and fired from a [[5. Mechanics/Objects/Ballista.md\|ballista]], usually one mounted on board a naval ship. An attack made with this bolt has a `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)` to hit, range 120/480 ft., deals `dice:6d10|noform|avg` (`6d10`) piercing damage upon a successful hit, and ignores any damage threshold of their target. If the attack is being made against an object or structure, this attack deals `dice:12d10|noform|avg` (`12d10`) piercing damage instead. Unlike most ballista bolts, kraken bolts may be used again after being shot, so long as they can be retrieved successfully.
