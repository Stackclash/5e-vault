# Revenant Standard
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), very rare (requires attunement by a creature that has died)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Revenant-Standard.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff looks like a war standard that's topped with a metal brazier. While holding it, an ethereal flag tumbles down from the staff's cross, as if it's hung there. You choose the flag's design, which is obviously illusory. You can mentally change the design using an action while holding the staff. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

While holding the staff, hostile creatures within 30 feet of you take an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) necrotic damage whenever they take necrotic damage for the first time on a turn. In addition, friendly creatures within that range make death saving throws with advantage; on a 20, a creature gains 20 temporary hit points as part of returning to consciousness.

The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice:1d8+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While the staff is on your person, it regains 1 expended charge whenever a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you. To be eligible, the humanoid can't have been behind total cover from the staff when it died, and it must have had a challenge rating of 1/2 or more.

While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16), using the spell's normal casting time: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bane.md\|bane]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hellish Rebuke.md\|hellish rebuke]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/See Invisibility.md\|see invisibility]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Dead.md\|speak with dead]] (3 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Spirit Guardians.md\|spirit guardians]] (3 charges; the spirits are of the dead humanoids). If a spell cast from the staff deals damage, the damage's type is necrotic.

Alternatively, when you hit a creature with the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) necrotic damage to that creature.
