This magic dagger was made from pieces of a slain basilisk and still retains some of its properties. The dagger deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) poison damage to any target it hits.

In addition, when you score a critical hit with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your next turn.
