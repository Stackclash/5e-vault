# Horn of the Fiendish Voice
*Wondrous Item, common, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you speak into this horn, your voice becomes magically amplified to twice its volume and is changed to sound deeper and more intimidating. A creature that hears this voice may make a DC 10 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check to realise it is artificial.
