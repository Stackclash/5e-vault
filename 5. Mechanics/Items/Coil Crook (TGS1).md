# Coil Crook
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Coil-Crook.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This smooth red staff is actually made from a rigid length of rope. You can speak the staff's command word as a bonus action to cause it to magically loosen and turn into a 10-foot length of decorative [[5. Mechanics/Items/Silk Rope 50 F(EET).md\|silken rope]]. You can speak the staff's command word again as a bonus action to cause the rope to untangle itself and become the solid staff form once more. It can be used as a spellcasting focus in either of these forms.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Rope Trick.md\|rope trick]] spell from it, using it as the rope required for the spell. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
