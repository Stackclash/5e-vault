# Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/helm-of-telepathy.webp#right]]  


While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]] spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]], you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Suggestion.md\|suggestion]] spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
