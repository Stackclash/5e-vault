# Bite-Back Belt
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Bite-Back-Belt.webp#right)  


This thick, reinforcing belt is lined with red, tongue-like leather and what appear to be silver teeth. While wearing the belt, whenever you take damage from a bite attack, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 2`). When this happens, the belt magically bites back at the attacker using its silvery teeth. Make a melee attack using the belt, with an attack bonus of +5. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage.
