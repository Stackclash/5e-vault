# Trick Knot
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Trick-Knot.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

This knotted ball of hempen rope weighs 5 pounds. A loop extends from it for easy carrying. While holding the ball, you can spend 10 consecutive minutes untying the knot. At the end of that time, the ball comes untied, duplicating the effects of the rope trick spell and extending upwards as a 30-foot length of floating rope. If there isn't enough space above you, the rope rises as far as it can before disappearing into the extradimensional space created by the spell.

The spell lasts for the full duration or until the rope is pulled from the space. When the spell ends, the rope magically ties itself into a new knotted ball, and this property of the ball can't be used again until the next dawn.
