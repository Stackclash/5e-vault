# Spool of Shadow
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Spool-of-Shadow.webp#right)  


Thin wisps of smoke gently rise from this spool of magic black thread. You can use the entire spool of thread to repair an article of clothing or embroider a design on one instead. In either case, it takes 1 hour to sew the entire spool's thread on an article of clothing, at which point the thread's magic is transferred to it. While a creature is wearing the article of clothing, it can add `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) to the total of any Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) check it makes. Once this property has been used for a third time, its magic is lost.
