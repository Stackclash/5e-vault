# Wand Charging Station
*Wondrous item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wand-Charging-Station.webp#right)  


A wand that's left in this wooden device for 8 consecutive hours regains `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) expended charges the next time it would normally regain charges within 24 hours. This `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) replaces the normal number of charges the wand regains each day. If a wand doesn't regain charges daily at dawn, dusk, or a similar time, this item has no effect on the wand. An artifact can't benefit from this item. Only one wand can be in the charging station at a time.

If you roll a 4 on both d4s, the wand's maximum number of charges increases by 1 for 24 hours. For example, if a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of Fireballs.md\|wand of fireballs]] is placed in the charging station and you roll a 4 on both dice to regain its expended charges, the wand begins the day with a total of 8 charges, instead of its normal 7.

If having an extra charge would potentially allow you to cast a spell from the wand at a level higher than 9th, the spell can nevertheless not exceed 9th level.
