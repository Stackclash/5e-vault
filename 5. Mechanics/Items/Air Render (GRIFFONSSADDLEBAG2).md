When you make a ranged attack with this magic bow, you can choose to fire a mote of wind instead of using an arrow. When you do, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls, and you can choose the form the wind takes, causing it to deal either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice). When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made in this way, the target also suffers from one of the following effects:

## Bludgeoning Gust

If the mote of wind dealt bludgeoning damage, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] or pushed 15 feet away from you (your choice). If the target is Huge or larger, it automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

## Piercing Wind

If the mote of wind dealt piercing damage, you can immediately make another attack with the same mote of wind against a different creature that is within 15 feet of the original target. This attack deals piercing damage.

## Slashing Tornado

If the mote of wind dealt slashing damage, each other creature within 5 feet of the original target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) slashing damage.
