# Gorgon War Pick
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/War Pick.md\|war pick]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Gorgon-War-Pick.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This war pick is made from the metal armor of a gorgon and designed in its visage. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with this weapon on the same turn, that target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage from the attack. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll against a creature with this weapon, the war pick's metal emits a small plume of weakened gorgon breath. When it does, the target's body begins to stiffen, and it takes a cumulative-10 foot penalty to its speed until it finishes a short or long rest, or until it's targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] spell or similar magic. This penalty can't reduce a creature's speed lower than 5 feet.
