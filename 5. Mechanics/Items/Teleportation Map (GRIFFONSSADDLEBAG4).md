# Teleportation Map
*Scroll, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Teleportation-Map.webp#right)  


This map is delicately inked on a magic scroll and kept in an elaborate travel case. Almost every teleportation map is different: some show maps of entire continents, whereas others are of local city streets or their immediate surroundings. When found, the GM decides the area and scale of the map on the scroll.

While holding the scroll, you can use an action to speak its command word and touch a point on the outstretched map. When you do, you and up to seven other creatures of your choice that are touching you are teleported to the spot you touched on the map. That spot on the map is then incinerated, leaving a charred 1-inch-radius circle around the point. If you touch a spot on the scroll that's charred and speak its command word, nothing happens.

Maps on a smaller scale can teleport you more accurately than those on a larger one. The GM decides how close you are to the intended target depending on where you touch the map in relation to its size and scale.

Each time you use this scroll, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the scroll bursts into flames (after teleporting you) and is destroyed. This number increases by 1 each time the map's been used, after the first. When found, the map has been used `dice:1d6-3|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 - 3`) times (minimum 0).
