# Dust of Darkness
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This fine black dust is crafted from ground black abishai horn and is capable of creating a cloud of darkness once released into the air. As an action, you may throw a pinch of this dust into the air around you, instantly creating a 15-foot radius cloud of shadow similar to the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Darkness.md\|darkness]] spell. You, and creatures you choose upon throwing the dust, are unaffected by this darkness and are able to see clearly through it. The darkness remains for 10 minutes. This bag has enough dust in it for 5 uses.
