You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The war pick deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) fire damage to any target it hits.

This weapon has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a target that is either made of metal or wearing metal armor, you can expend 1 charge to inflict an extra `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage to the target.
