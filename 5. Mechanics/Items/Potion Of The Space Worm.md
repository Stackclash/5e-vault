# Potion of the Space Worm
*Potion, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

When you drink this potion, you temporarily gain an other-dimensional awareness of reality, as if the secrets of the universe have been laid bare before you. For the next hour, you have the following benefits:

- You have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#truesight\|truesight]] out to a range of 100 feet.  
- You cannot be surprised.  
- You have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks.  
- You have advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks made to navigate or find your way to something, and you are immune to any magical effect that would attempt to misdirect you or hamper your navigation.  
- Whenever you roll to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you may use your reaction to reroll that dice and use the new result instead. You may decide to use this ability after making the initial roll, but before the DM determines if it is a success or not.  

This potion has a chunky consistency and is pitch black. It has a lingering flavor of spice that is vaguely reminiscent of cinnamon.
