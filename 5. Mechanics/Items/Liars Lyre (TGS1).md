# Liar's Lyre
*Instrument, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Liars-Lyre.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This magical lyre's strings reverberate with enchantment magic when you tell lies, allowing you to deceive other creatures more easily. You have advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]) checks you make when you spend at least 1 minute attempting to convince a creature of a lie. In addition, if you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vicious Mockery.md\|vicious mockery]] cantrip while holding the lyre, the spell save DC is increased by 1. You are proficient with this lyre while you're attuned to it.
