# Staff of the Dream Shepherd
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Staff-of-the-Dream-Shepherd.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff's cushioned handle is lined with soft wool and decorated with star and moon patches. While the staff is within 5 feet of you, you can use an action to immediately fall asleep, but otherwise can't be put to sleep by magical means. While attuned to the staff, you regain 1 extra Hit Die whenever you finish a long rest.

In addition, while holding the staff, you can use an action to summon a flock of spectral sheep. The sheep run in a line 20 feet long and 10 feet wide originating from you before disappearing. Each creature of your choice in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, taking `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw and has 20 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it also falls asleep. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed can't be put to sleep in this way. A sleeping creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] and stays asleep for 1 minute, until it takes damage, or until someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
