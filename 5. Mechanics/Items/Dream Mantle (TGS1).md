# Dream Mantle
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Dream-Mantle.webp#right)  


This short purple cape is vaguely iridescent and is difficult to look at from afar. The cape creates illusions of faraway places that are visible only to creatures 30 or more feet away. While wearing this cloak, creatures more than 30 feet away from you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect you based on sight and make ranged attacks against you with disadvantage. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

In addition, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dream.md\|dream]] spell (save DC 16) using the mantle, using yourself as the messenger within the dream. Once this property of the mantle has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
