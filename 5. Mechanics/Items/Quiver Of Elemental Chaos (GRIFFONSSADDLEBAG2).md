# Quiver of Elemental Chaos
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Quiver-of-Elemental-Chaos.webp#right)  


This quiver has a lid with 5 holes in it and has depictions of the Elemental Planes on its side. It has 4 buttons along its top that correspond to each of the four elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.

## Elemental Ammunition

The quiver can have up to 5 arrows or bolts on display at a time, which appear through the holes in its lid. You can press one of the quiver's buttons using a bonus action to cause it to create and display 1 elemental arrow or bolt. The type of arrow or bolt depends on the button you press. The quiver can produce up to 5 of each type of ammunition in this way each day.

Any arrow or bolt created by this quiver is magical and has the following properties based on its element. The ammunition is only magical for you, and any arrow or bolt removed from the quiver loses its magic at the end of the turn.

## Air Ammunition

This ammunition is weightless and whistles softly as it moves. This piece of ammunition can be fired at its long range without disadvantage and deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) thunder damage to any target it hits. In addition, any magical atmospheric effect that the arrow passes through cast at 3rd level or lower, such as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Stinking Cloud.md\|stinking cloud]], is dispelled.

## Earth Ammunition

This ammunition carries an uncanny force behind it and turns to stone at its end. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

## Fire Ammunition

This ammunition has tongues of fire licking up its side and spews embers at the slightest movement. When shot, it erupts into a plume of white-hot flame. This piece of ammunition deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage to any target it hits. Hit or miss, the ammunition explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage.

## Water Ammunition

This ammunition has a silky texture and glitters with watery reflections. A ranged attack made with this ammunition ignores the normal penalties of underwater fighting and deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage to any target it hits, or `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) piercing damage if the target is made of fire. In addition, any nonmagical flames within 10 feet of this ammunition's point of impact are extinguished when it hits.

## Paraelemental Ammunition

You can press two compatible elemental buttons at the same time as a bonus action to create a paraelemental arrow or bolt: a hybrid piece of ammunition. Water and Air create Ice, Fire and Earth create Magma, Earth and Water create Ooze, and Air and Fire create Smoke. This ammunition appears from a special compartment in the quiver's lid. The quiver can create 1 of each type of paraelemental ammunition each day. A non-compatible combination, such as Fire and Water or Air and Earth, has no effect.

## Ice Ammunition

This special piece of frosted ammunition is cold to the touch and casts off snowflakes when it moves. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) cold damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]] for 1 minute. On a success, the target's speed is halved until the end of its next turn. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect ends early if the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]] target takes fire damage.

## Magma Ammunition

This special piece of glimmering ammunition is warm to the touch and flakes off in sooty pieces. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) fire damage. Hit or miss, the area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact becomes unbearably hot until the end of the turn. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] from the sudden flash of heat. A creature with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

## Ooze Ammunition

This special piece of sticky ammunition gives off a faint, alchemical odor. This ammunition creates a unique [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Grease.md\|grease]] spell (save DC 15) at the point of impact. This version of the spell covers a 20-foot-square area, and any creature that starts its turn [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] in the area takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) acid damage.

## Smoke Ammunition

This special piece of black ammunition feels smooth like coal to the touch and releases a faint wisp of smoke. This ammunition duplicates the effect of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fog Cloud.md\|fog cloud]] spell (2nd-level version) at the point of impact, with the exception that this fog is pitch black.
