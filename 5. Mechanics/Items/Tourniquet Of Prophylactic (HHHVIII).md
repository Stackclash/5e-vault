This tourniquet is made from a bulezau tail treated with medicinal herbs and oils. So long as you wear this tourniquet, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming diseased or to end a disease on yourself. Any time you succeed on either of those saving throws, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.
