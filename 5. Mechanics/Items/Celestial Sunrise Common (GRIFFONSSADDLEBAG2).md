The typical [[5. Mechanics/Items/Celestial Sunrise (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|celestial sunrise]], a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes light to pour from your mouth for 1 hour after you drink it. The light shines in a cone from your mouth, casting bright light for 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The potion glows softly on its own, even if no light is shining through it. The beverage is rejuvenating and powerfully flavored with pineapple, orange, and honey, with just a hint of pomegranate as an aftertaste. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
