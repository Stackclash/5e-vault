# Keoghtom's Ointment
*Wondrous Item, minor, uncommon*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/keoghtoms-ointment.jpg#right]]  


This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `dice: 1d4 + 1|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh Â½ pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains `dice: 2d8 + 2|avg` (`2d8 + 2`) hit points, ceases to be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]], and is cured of any disease.
