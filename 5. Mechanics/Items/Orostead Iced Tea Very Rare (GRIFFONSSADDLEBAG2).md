# Orostead Iced Tea (Very Rare)
*Potion, minor, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Orostead-Iced-Tea.webp#right)  


The following [[5. Mechanics/Items/Orostead Iced Tea (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md\|Orostead iced tea]] is a very rare variant with additional properties. It also tastes better. When made, a tea has enough for `dice:6+1d4|noform|avg` (`6 + 1d4`) sips before it's used up, instead of a single use. You can take a sip as an action.

When you take a sip of this potion, roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) and consult the table below instead to determine which one of the following benefits you gain. Once you've gained a benefit from the table, you can't gain that same benefit again until you finish a long rest.

`dice: [[Orostead Iced Tea Very Rare (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG2).md#^very-rare-effect]]`

| 1 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength ability checks and saving throws, as well as attack and damage rolls for weapons that use Strength. |
| 2 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity ability checks and saving throws, as well as attack and damage rolls for weapons that use Dexterity. |
| 3 | You gain `dice:2d10+20\|noform\|avg` (`2d10 + 20`) temporary hit points. |
| 4 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence ability checks and saving throws. If Intelligence is your spellcasting ability, you also gain a +2 bonus to your spell attack rolls and spell save DC for the duration. |
| 5 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom ability checks and saving throws. If Wisdom is your spellcasting ability, you also gain a +2 bonus to your spell attack rolls and spell save DC for the duration. |

| 8 | You recover expended spells slots with a combined level that is equal to or less than 8, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. If you don't have any expended spell slots, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] spell once within the next 8 hours, casting the spell at 6th level and using a spell save DC of 16 when you do. |
