![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Owlbear-Leather-Armor.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 11 + Dex modifier
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

This set of leather armor was made from the remains of a hardy and ferocious owlbear. While wearing this armor, if you fail a Constitution saving throw against an effect from a hostile source, you can choose to succeed instead. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
