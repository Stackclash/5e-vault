# Spectrum Rose
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1,000 gp

## Description:

An extraordinarily rare rose, coveted for both its beauty and its power. With a flower head that shines with every gradient of the visible light spectrum, it is easily identifiable among its more mundane relatives. When brewed into a tea and drunk, this herb strengthens every aspect of the imbiber, as if imparting the powerful cascade of the entire rainbow. Unfortunately, this plant is impossible to cultivate and any attempts at growing it domestically merely results in a regular rose of a random colour. Why this occurs is unknown, but it does result in any discovery of a naturally occurring specimen to be particularly extraordinary.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after using this herb, you are proficient in all saving throws. If you were already proficient, you double your proficiency bonus for that saving throw instead.
