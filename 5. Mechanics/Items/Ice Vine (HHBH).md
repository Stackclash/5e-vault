# Ice Vine
*Herb, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

It is rare to find vines in the arctic, as the arid environment doesn't lend itself to strong supports to climb, nor does the cold promote the watery and supple structure of a vine. The ice vine overcomes both of these challenges however, by growing itself along icy stalactites, as well as possessing the uncanny ability to be immune to outside temperatures. Its ability to remain cool regardless of the weather has led to it being used as a source of refrigeration, as well as for comfortable bedding in summer months.

## Effect:

This 10-foot length of vine remains icy-cold regardless of the environmental temperature.
