This crooked, jet black dagger curses the blood of any creature hit with it. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with this weapon that isn't a construct, plant, or undead, that creature is cursed until the end of your next turn. While cursed by the dagger, it has disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks made to hide and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw whenever it magically regains hit points. On a failed save, the creature instead takes necrotic damage equal to the amount healed (maximum 20).
