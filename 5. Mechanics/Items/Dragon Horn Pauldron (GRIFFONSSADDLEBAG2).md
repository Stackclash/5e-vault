This single pauldron is made from the horn of a fallen dragon. While wearing it, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to one damage type, which is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the horn, as shown on the table below.

| Dragon | Resistance |
|--------|------------|
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |
^dragon-resistance

In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage of this resisted type, you can use your reaction to instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.
