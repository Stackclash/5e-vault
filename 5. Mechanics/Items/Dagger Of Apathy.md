While this item is in your hand, you may use your bonus action to speak its command word, causing it to radiate a lifeless energy for the next minute. While it is radiating this energy, any creature hit by this weapon that is not a construct or undead must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be struck by an overwhelming sense of apathy and lifelessness for 1 minute. An apathetic creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws, and on its turn may use either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of its turn, a creature affected by this ability may attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds this saving throw is immune to the effects of this dagger for the next 24 hours.
