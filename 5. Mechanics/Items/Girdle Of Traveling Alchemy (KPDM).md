# Girdle of Traveling Alchemy
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


This wide leather girdle has many sewn-in pouches and holsters that hold an assortment of empty beakers and vials. Once you have attuned to the girdle, these containers magically fill with the following liquids:

- 2 flasks of alchemist's fire  
- 2 flasks of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Ice (KPDM).md\|alchemist's ice]]  
- 2 [[5. Mechanics/Items/Acid Vi(AL).md\|vials of acid]]  
- 2 jars of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Swarm Repellent (KPDM).md\|swarm repellent]]  
- 1 vial of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Assassins Blood.md\|assassin's blood]] poison  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Climbing.md\|potion of climbing]]  
- 1 [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing.md\|potion of healing]]  

Each container magically replenishes each day at dawn, if you are wearing the girdle. All the potions and alchemical substances produced by the girdle lose their properties if they're transferred to another container before being used.
