# Great Owl's Shroud
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Great-Owls-Shroud.webp#right)  


This draping shoulder cloak flutters softly while worn, even if there isn't a breeze. The cloak has 10 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action while wearing this garment, you can replace one or more of your attacks with a special ranged spell attack using the cloak, expending 1 of its charges for each attack you replace. When you do, you flourish the cloak and release a barrage of magical feathers that fly toward the target. You have a +5 bonus to attack rolls made with the cloak, which have a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d4+3|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4 + 3`) force damage. After the attack, the feathers vanish.

In addition, you can use a reaction when you fall to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] spell from the cloak, targeting only yourself. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
