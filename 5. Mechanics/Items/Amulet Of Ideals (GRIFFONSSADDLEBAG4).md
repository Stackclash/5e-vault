# Amulet of Ideals
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Amulet-of-Ideals.webp#right)  


This hollow silver locket depicts a pair of heavy temple doors. Pressing the button at its center opens the locket. As part of attuning to the item, you must place a trinket within the hollow space. The trinket must be representative in some way, either to you or to your deity, of your cleric domain or paladin oath. While wearing the amulet, the first time you use your Channel Divinity, it doesn't expend a use of that feature. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

The amulet has 5 charges. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the amulet, whenever you cast a spell from your domain or oath spell list, you can expend 1 or more of the amulet's charges to reduce the spell slot level required to cast it by 1 for each charge spent; a spell reduced below 1st level in this way doesn't require you to expend a spell slot. This property can't be used to cast a spell of a level for which you don't have spell slots, nor can it be used to cast a spell of 6th level or higher.
