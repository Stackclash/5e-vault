# Doublet of Cosmic Protection
*Cursed item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to psychic damage, and if you succeed on a saving throw against an effect imposed by a creature that would have resulted in you either becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or taking psychic damage, you may use your reaction to reflect that effect back on the creature that targeted you originally. That creature makes the same saving throw with the same DC, and if they fail, they suffer the same effects that you would have suffered. If that effect is to become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], they become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for the duration.
