# Dryadleaf
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Dryadleaf.webp#right)  


This magic plant only grows at the base of trees that are often stepped through by [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fey/Dryad.md\|dryads]]. Its leaves continuously shift as if by a breeze. Touching the plant, even gently, causes its leaves to stop their gentle swaying for 1 minute.

Dryadleaf plants only grow up to 4 leaves at a time and are found in the wild with `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) matured leaves. Leaves are fully matured once they have a thin yellow rim. You can use an action to eat a mature leaf. When you do, you can speak to beasts and plants for 1 minute as if you shared a language. Once it's been picked, a leaf retains this property for 7 days before it wilts.

You can move the plant to a pot over the course of 1 minute. When you do, make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Nature\|Nature]]) or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check. On a success, the delicate plant survives the transfer to a new pot. On a failure, the plant is irreversibly damaged and dies.

The plant can survive with surprisingly little air, allowing it to survive in an extradimensional space such as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bag Of Holding.md\|bag of holding]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Portable Hole.md\|portable hole]]. So long as it's watered lightly each day and given a moderate amount of sunlight (weather and environment permitting), the plant grows `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) missing mature leaves every 7 days.
