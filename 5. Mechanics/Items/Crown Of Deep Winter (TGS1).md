# Crown of Deep Winter
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Crown-of-Deep-Winter.webp#right)  


This icy crown is made using ice from the Everglacier. While wearing the crown, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fire Shield.md\|fire shield]] spell from it, making only a chill shield when you do. Once the crown has cast this spell, it can't cast it again until the next dawn.

## Frozen Burst

While wearing this crown, you can use your reaction when a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack to cause the area around you to explode in a burst of razor-sharp icicles. When you do, all creatures within 5 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) cold damage, or half as much on a success. This property of the crown can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
