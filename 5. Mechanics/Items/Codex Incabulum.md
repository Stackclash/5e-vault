# Codex Incabulum
*Wondrous Item, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/codex-incabulum.jpg#right]]  


The only codex known to be written during the Caelian Empire, the codex incabulum is often incorrectly cited as the cause of the Fall of Azshan. This is a popular guess repeated so often that it has attained the status of fact. Rather, the codex *stopped* the demonic infestation that razed the ruling city of Kham, confining the sea of fiends that erupted from hell and preventing it from spreading across the world. As a result, no contemporaneous accounts of the sack of the city survive, with the popular histories of the event being authored no earlier than 150 years after the event.

Authored by Marcus Gaius Orestes ^[During their lives, the True Names of the authors of the codices were a closely guarded secret, but research in the decades and centuries following their deaths has often ferreted out the truth.] in the 101st year of the Age of Conquest, during the height of the Caelian Empire, this book—like all the codices—has been lost and found many times over the centuries since. Often those who attune to it delve deep into dark powers and are lost.

## Demon Soul

As an action, you can sacrifice 3 Hit Dice to assume the form of a Type III demon or a bone devil, replacing your own stats and abilities with the fiend's. While in this form, you do not benefit from your original race or class abilities, but you can cast your spells normally if you assume a form that can cast spells.

You can maintain this form for 1 hour or until you drop [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious\|unconscious]], after which you revert to your original form, and can heal the sacrificed damage and hit points normally.

## Damnation

Demons and devils automatically fail their saving throws against banish cast by you.

## Scion of Seven Cities

After performing a ritual for 10 minutes, you can open a gate to one of the Seven Cities of Hell, allowing you to freely travel there from the Mundane World. Only you can use this gate. It remains open until you return through it, after which it closes.

## Flames of Hell

Once per week as an action, you may sacrifice Hit Dice to summon a [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Legion Of Hell.md\|Legion of Hell]]. This unit's size depends on the number of Hit Dice you sacrificed, as follows.

| Hit Dice Sacrificed | Size of Unit |
|---------------------|--------------|
| 2 | `dice: 1d4\|avg` (`1d4`) |
| 4 | `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) |
| 6 | `dice: 1d8\|avg` (`1d8`) |
| 8 | `dice: 1d10\|avg` (`1d10`) |
| 10 | `dice: 1d12\|avg` (`1d12`) |

## The Key to the Gate

While the codex incabulum is on the Mundane World, summoned demons and devils cannot summon more demons or devils. Should the *Book of Fiends* ever leave the Mundane World, however, this restriction would be lifted, and then even minor demons could gate in powerful allies, who themselves could gate in more allies, until armies of demons flooded the world.
