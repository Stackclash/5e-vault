# Petal Dancer Ward
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Petal-Dancer-Ward.webp#right)  


This cape is made of colorful and aromatic petals. While wearing the cape, petals drift behind you as you walk and disappear before touching the ground. You can use a bonus action to change the color of these petals. While wearing the cape, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Druidcraft.md\|druidcraft]] cantrip from it, and creatures with the *keen smell* trait make attacks of opportunity against you with disadvantage.
