# Hat Trick
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Hat-Trick.webp#right)  


This gaudy purple hat allows the wearer to perform some minor magical feats. The hat has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While holding the hat, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell from it, pulling the familiar from the hat. The summoned familiar must take the form of either a rabbit or dove, using the statistics for a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Weasel.md\|weasel]] or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Owl.md\|owl]], respectively. The familiar remains for up to 1 minute, instead of its normal duration, and cannot be used to deliver spells.

In addition, while wearing the hat, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Prestidigitation.md\|prestidigitation]] spell from it. When cast in this way, the spell can only be used to create harmless, illusory effects.
