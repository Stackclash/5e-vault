# Tide Turner
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Tide-Turner.webp#right)  


This magical brass timepiece has a pearl from the Lunar Sea at its top and tells you the phase of the moon, time between dawn and dusk, and time between high and low tides while on the Material Plane. Other planes may cause the device's various dials to behave differently. For example, on the Elemental Plane of Water, the tide's dial may spin chaotically, whereas the daytime dial may only move based on your location while on the home plane of fey creatures.
