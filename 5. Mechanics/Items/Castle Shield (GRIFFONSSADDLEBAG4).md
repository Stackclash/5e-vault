# Castle Shield
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Castle-Shield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This tall shield resembles a castle battlement. Despite appearing to be made of stone, it weighs the same as a normal shield. While holding the shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. Additionally, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take is reduced by 2, unless the source of the damage is a siege weapon or a creature with the Siege Monster trait.

## Summon Fortifications

While holding the shield, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Stone.md\|wall of stone]] spell from the shield (save DC 16). This version of the spell creates a stone wall that's lined with parapets and has battlements between each of the wall's panels. An illusory archer appears at the top of each battlement. At initiative count 20, each archer fires a magical arrow at the nearest hostile creature that it can see within 60 feet of it; the archers have a passive Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) score of 16. Make an attack roll for the archers as a group, using an attack bonus of +8, and use the result as the attack roll against each target. On a hit, a target takes `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) force damage for each arrow that hits it. When a panel is destroyed, any battlement connected to it is destroyed, and the archer disappears. The wall vanishes at the end of the spell's duration. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
