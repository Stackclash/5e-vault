# Soothstriker
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Rapier.md\|rapier]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Soothstriker.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This rapier can magically attack through temporal ripples, allowing you to save an attack for another time. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While holding the rapier, you can use an action to strike the air in front of you with it; roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) and record the result. You can do this up to 4 times each day, losing any recorded rolls and regaining all expended uses daily at dawn. Whenever you attack a target with the rapier, you can choose to make up to two extra attacks against it as part of the same action, provided you have that number of recorded d20s. Use a different recorded `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) for the attack roll of each of these extra attacks, instead of making a new attack roll (adding your Strength or Dexterity modifier, including the weapon's +3 bonus, to the weapon's attack and damage rolls as normal). The attacks are made simultaneously against the target, piercing through the fabric of spacetime with each attack. Each used `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) is then lost.
