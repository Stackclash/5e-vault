# Magical Dowsing Rod
*Wondrous Item, rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This item forms a Y-shape with two handles and a pointing extension. When a creature holds the handles, the pointing extension moves until it is pointing at the nearest magical object within 120 feet (itself excluded). This item will not point at magical objects within 120 feet that are covered by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
