# Shadenstaff
*Staff, weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]]), major, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Shadenstaff.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff is made from the reclaimed horn of a huge undead creature. While you're attuned to the staff, you have advantage on saving throws to retain your sanity against the influence of environment effects. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.

The staff has 15 charges for the following properties and regains `dice:2d6+3|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6 + 3`) expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff disintegrates in a plume of pitch black smoke and emits a terrifying scream audible out to 300 feet.

## Annihilating Strike

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) necrotic damage to the target.

## Spells

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] (1 charge), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Darkness.md\|darkness]] (2 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Evil And Good.md\|dispel evil and good]] (5 charges), [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Inflict Wounds.md\|inflict wounds]] (3rd-level version, 3 charges), or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Circle Of Death.md\|circle of death]] (6 charges).
