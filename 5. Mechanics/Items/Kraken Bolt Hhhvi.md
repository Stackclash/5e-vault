# Kraken Bolt
*Ammunition, very rare, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This several-foot-long bolt is designed to be loaded and fired from a ballista, usually one mounted on board a naval ship. An attack made with this bolt has a `dice: d20+10` (+10 to hit), range 120/480 ft., deals `dice: 6d10|avg` (`6d10`) piercing damage upon a successful hit, and ignores any damage threshold of their target. If the attack is being made against an object or structure, this attack deals `dice: 12d10|avg` (`12d10`) piercing damage instead. Unlike most ballista bolts, kraken bolts may be used again after being shot, so long as they can be retrieved successfully.
