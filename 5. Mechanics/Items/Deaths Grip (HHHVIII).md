You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. When you hit a target with this weapon on your turn, you may immediately use your bonus action to attempt to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] them, using this weapon instead of a free hand. If your target is a creature with less than half of its maximum hit points, your [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Grapple\|grapple]] check is made with advantage, and if it is successful, your target is considered [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] as well.

While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] in this way, you may not make attacks with this weapon.
