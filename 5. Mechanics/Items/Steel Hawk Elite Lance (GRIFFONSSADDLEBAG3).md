You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. As an action, you can thrust the lance in a direction to cause a line of powerful wind to erupt from the lance. The line is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. Each creature in the line is buffeted by the wind and must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet in a random direction that's perpendicular to the line. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. You then fly up to 30 feet in a straight line in that same direction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once this property of the lance has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
