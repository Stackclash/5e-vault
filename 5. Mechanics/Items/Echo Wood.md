# Echo Wood
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A hardy birch tree that manages to grow on cold peaks. Its wood is infamous for its resonance properties as it bends and reflects the mountain winds around itself, often causing a cascading echo effect that gives it its name. Even the sap of its bark can provide some of this effect, and strips of it can be used as a weapon cloth that lends a resounding (and dangerous)boom to any weapon that it oils.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A weapon that has had this herb applied to it is considered magical and deals an additional `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) thunder damage upon its first successful hit in a turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
