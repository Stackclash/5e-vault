# Seer's Starlight Cloak
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Seers-Starlight--Cloak-.webp#right)  


This deep purple cloak is hemmed with a silver lining that radiates into starburst patterns around the head and arms. When in darkness, tiny stars can be seen from within the cloak's fabric. A constellation of stars in the shape of an eye can always be seen on the front of the cloak's dramatic hood. While wearing the cloak, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Guidance.md\|guidance]] spell.

While you can see the night sky and are wearing the cloak, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Augury.md\|augury]] spell. When you do, the omens are represented by the number of shooting stars that appear in the sky:

- **Three or more shooting stars,** for good results  
- **One shooting star,** for bad results  
- **Two shooting stars,** for both good and bad results  
- **Nothing,** for results that aren't especially good or bad  

Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
