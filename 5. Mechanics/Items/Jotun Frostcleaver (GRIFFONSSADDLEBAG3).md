# Jotun Frostcleaver
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Greataxe.md\|greataxe]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Jotun-Frostcleaver.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d12 S
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Heavy\|Heavy]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

When you hit with an attack using this magic greataxe, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage. While holding it, you can speak its command word using a bonus action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|enlarge/reduce]] spell (Enlarge only) on yourself. For the duration, the weapon's cold damage die is a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`), and whenever you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] on the spell, you can roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) and add the number rolled to the saving throw. In addition, when you roll a 7 or 8 on the weapon's cold damage die, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. Once the axe has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
