# Crown of Limitless Knowledge
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing this crown, you gain the following benefits:

- Your Intelligence score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.  
- You can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within your entire life.  
- You can speak and understand every language.  
- You may cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Legend Lore.md\|legend lore]] spell without requiring any components or spell slots. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.  
- If your total for an Intelligence check is less than your Intelligence score, you can use that score in place of what you rolled.
