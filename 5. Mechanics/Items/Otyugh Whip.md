Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#grapple\|grapple]] check against them as a free action, using the whip to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#grapple\|grapple]] instead of your free hand. This ability can only be used once per turn. While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#grappled\|grappled]] in this way, you may not attack with this whip.
