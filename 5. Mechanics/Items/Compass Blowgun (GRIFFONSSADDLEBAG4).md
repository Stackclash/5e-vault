When you hit a creature with a blowgun needle fired from this weapon, that creature becomes magically tracked by it. For the next hour after hitting a creature in this way, you can use an action to place the blowgun on the ground. When you do, the blowgun spins and rolls, like a compass needle, to point in the direction of the tracked creature. The weapon only reveals the direction to the target, and not the distance to it. The effect ends early if you're ever more than 1,000 feet away from the tracked creature or if you track a different one.
