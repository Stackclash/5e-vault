# Sovereignseed Satchel
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Sovereignseed-Satchel.webp#right)  


This unassuming leather satchel is embroidered with a floral pattern and is connected to a strange garden on a special demiplane. The garden produces 4 magical seeds daily at dawn, which automatically appear at the bottom of the bag each day. When you open the bag to retrieve the seeds for the first time each day, roll `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) and consult the table below to determine the nature of each seed. Any unused seeds turn to dust and are destroyed daily at dawn when the bag produces a new batch of seeds.

| dice: d6 | Seed |
|----------|------|
| 1 | **Binding Bur.** You can throw this jagged bur as if it were a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dart.md\|dart]] or use it as a sling bullet. A Large or smaller creature hit by the bur must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by it for 1 minute, as the bur rapidly grows to form a series of entangling plants around it. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] in this way can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success. The bur withers and is destroyed once a creature succeeds on the saving throw or is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by it. |
| 2 | **Bouncing Bloom.** You can use an action to plant this seed in the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach. When you do, a 5-foot-radius flower immediately grows in the space. A creature that jumps from the flower is propelled three times the normal distance, up to the creature's remaining movement, without the need for a running start. The flower withers away and is destroyed after 10 minutes or after it's been used to propel a creature in this way ten times. |
| 3 | **Cloaking Cotton.** You can use an action to hurl this boll into the air at a point within 5 feet of you. When you do, the boll erupts into an opaque cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere, centered on that point. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The sphere does not move with you. The cloud remains for 1 minute, until it's dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour), or until 5 or more fire damage is dealt to a target within the area. |
| 4 | **Fiddle-Ferry Fig.** You can use an action to plant this seed in the ground or place it in a body of water in an unoccupied space within your reach. When you do, the seed immediately grows into a single, large leaf. A creature can break the leaf off its stem using an action. The leaf is 10 feet long and 5 feet across and can support up to 300 pounds. Creatures standing or sitting on the leaf while it's falling descend at a rate of 60 feet per round, or are supported by the leaf when floating in the water. If the leaf is carrying more than 300 pounds, it immediately falls or sinks as normal. After 1 hour, the leaf and stem wither away and are destroyed. |
| 5 | **Rose of Radiance.** While held, this seed emits a warm glow, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Alternatively, you can use an action to plant the seed in the ground at a point within your reach. When you do, a single, golden rose grows at the start of your next turn that sheds light twice as far as the seed. The effect lasts for 8 hours or until the flower is moved or destroyed. |
| 6 | **Spanning Sprout.** You can use an action to plant this seed in the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach. When you do, a bridge made of twisting vines grows horizontally in a line that's 5 feet wide and up to 30 feet long in a direction of your choice. The vines are sturdy and can support up to 500 pounds at a time, provided that both ends of the bridge connect to a solid surface, such as a point on the ground or a wall. The bridge withers away and is destroyed after 1 hour, or if it takes 15 slashing or fire damage (AC 10). |
