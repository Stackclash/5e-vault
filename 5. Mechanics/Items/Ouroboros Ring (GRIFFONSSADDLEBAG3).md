# Ouroboros Ring
*Ring, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Ouroboros-Ring.webp#right)  


A silver serpent twists around itself three times to form the shape of this ring. Its tail is bitten by its jeweled head. While wearing the ring, when a creature that you can see (including yourself) rolls a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`), you can use your reaction to speak the ring's command word and roll a `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`). You make this decision after knowing the result of the roll, but before the GM declares the outcome.

When you do, you alter the number rolled on the `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`), before any modifiers are added to it. You can choose to either add or subtract the number you rolled on the `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) to or from the `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). The `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) is treated as if it had originally rolled the altered number. If the `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) would cause the number rolled on the `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) to be greater than 20 or less than 1, continue to count up or down as though the next number after 20 were 1, or the number below 1 were 20. For example, a creature rolls a 19 on its `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) for an attack roll against you, before any modifiers are added to the roll. You use your reaction to roll a 4 on the `dice:d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) and add it to the 19, causing the `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`) to be treated as if it had rolled a 3.

Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
