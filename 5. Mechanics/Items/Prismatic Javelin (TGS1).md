This dark crystal javelin has a prismatic head that can refract light into beautiful displays of color. Immediately after you throw this javelin and it hits a target within 120 feet of you, the javelin disappears in a small burst of light before reappearing in your open hand.

As an action, you can throw the javelin at a point you can see within 120 feet of you and speak its command word. When the javelin lands, it erupts in a dazzling display of color and light, casting painful bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. Creatures of your choice within the bright light must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. For each creature hit by the light, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) to determine the color of light that hits it and type of damage that it takes using the table below. A creature that fails the saving throw takes `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) damage for each beam of light that hits it of the type determined by the table. A creature behind total cover from the javelin is not affected. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
