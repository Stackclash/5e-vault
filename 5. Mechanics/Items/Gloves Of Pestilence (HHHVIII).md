# Gloves of Pestilence
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While wearing these gloves, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with your unarmed strikes, and their damage type changes to slashing. In addition, if you make a successful critical hit against a creature with an unarmed strike, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected by a disease for the next minute. Constructs and undead automatically succeed this saving throw. While infected in this way, a creature can't regain hit points and they suffer `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. They may make the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the disease on a success.
