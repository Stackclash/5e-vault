# Great Owl's Crown
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws while wearing this crown, and you can understand and speak to owls and owlbears.

The crown has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the crown, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to detect if there are any [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Owl.md\|owl]]s or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Owlbear.md\|owlbear]]s within 1000 feet of you. If you detect any owls or owlbears within the crown's range, you learn the direction and distance to the closest one. Alternatively, you can expend 1 of the crown's charges to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animal Messenger.md\|animal messenger]] spell from it, which must target a beast with a flying speed.
