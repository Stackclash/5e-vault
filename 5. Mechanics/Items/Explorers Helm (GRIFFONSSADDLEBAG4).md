# Explorer's Helm
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Explorers-Helm.webp#right)  


While wearing this helmet, you're considered proficient with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cartographers Tools.md\|cartographer's tools]]. You also have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks, and you always know which way is north if you're outside. In addition, if you've been traveling at a consistent pace for at least 1 hour, nonmagical difficult terrain doesn't slow your travel while you continue at that pace.
