# Mermaid Trousers
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Mermaid-Trousers.webp#right)  


These trousers glimmer with reflective scales. The bottom of each leg widens into a fin-like, colorful lace. While you're wearing the trousers and are completely submerged in water, you can use a bonus action to tap your feet together to transform your legs into a fish's tail, as if you were a merfolk. While transformed, you can breathe underwater, you gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you can understand Aquan. You remain in this form until you use a bonus action to end the effect or until you're no longer completely submerged in water. Any gear you're wearing on your legs that wouldn't fit on the transformed tail melds into the new form: you can continue to activate and benefit from the equipment while you're transformed.
