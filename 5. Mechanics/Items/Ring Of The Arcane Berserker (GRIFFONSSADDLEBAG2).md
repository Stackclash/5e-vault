# Ring of the Arcane Berserker
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement by a barbarian)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Ring-of-the-Arcane-Berserker.webp#right)  


This dark silver ring is decorated by a metallic skull with an amethyst gemstone embedded in its forehead. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] spell (+5 to hit with ranged spell attack) from it.

This ring has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can cast a spell even if you're raging by expending 1 of the ring's charges as part of casting the spell. If you do, your rage does not end at the end of your turn as a result of not attacking a hostile creature. In addition, you can concentrate on spells while raging, but have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain your concentration on them when you take damage.
