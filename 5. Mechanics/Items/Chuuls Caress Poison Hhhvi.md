# Chuul's Caress Poison
*Adventuring Gear, uncommon, Crafted by*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This poison can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.
