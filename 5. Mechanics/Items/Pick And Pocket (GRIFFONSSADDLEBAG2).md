![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Pick-and-Pocket.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Finesse\|Finesse]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Light\|Light]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Thrown\|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This brass and steel dagger can also be used as part of a set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]] when picking locks. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, as well as on any ability check you make using [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]] to pick open a lock, provided you use the dagger as part of the set of tools.

While holding the dagger in one hand and a small enough object in another, you can use an action to speak the dagger's command word and twist it in the air as if it were a key. When you do, the object is shunted into a special demiplane, where it remains until you either twist the dagger in the opposite direction on your turn (no action required) or until you're no longer holding the weapon. If you have a free hand, the stored object reappears in it when the object leaves the demiplane. Otherwise, it reappears at your feet. The demiplane can only store one object at a time, which must be no more than 1 foot on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds.
