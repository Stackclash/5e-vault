# Gargoyle's Lichen
*Herb, common, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 1 gp

## Description:

Quite difficult to find due to its stony-grey complexion, the gargoyle's lichen is said to grow on the rubble of its namesake's corpse. While it is ultimately harmless, the lichen does contain a chemical that reacts with many creature's skin when rubbed on it, causing it to harden and turn grey like stone. Although it may look unpleasant to some, it has been used as part of religious ceremonies in some cultures to mimic certain creatures from ancient stories.

## Effect:

For 8 hours after using this herb, your skin takes on a hard, grey appearance that resembles stone.
