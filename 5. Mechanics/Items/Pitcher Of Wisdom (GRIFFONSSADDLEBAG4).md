# Pitcher of Wisdom
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Pitcher-of-Wisdom.webp#right)  


This small clay pot has a comfortable handle and resembles a stylized owl. When you drink a magic potion from this pitcher using an action, such as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Healing.md\|potion of healing]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potion Of Giant Strength.md\|potion of giant strength]], you also have advantage on any Wisdom saving throws you make for the duration of the potion's effects, with a minimum duration of until the end of your next turn and a maximum duration of 1 hour.

You can pour the potion into the clay pot as part of the action to drink the potion, provided you're not holding anything else in either hand.
