# Wand of Torchlight
*Wand, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Wand-of-Torchlight.webp#right)  


This wooden wand is twisted into a torch-like shape. Its wood is charred at its flame-shaped tip. While holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing a harmless flame to sputter to life at its end. The light sheds bright and dim light like a normal torch, and remains until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again.

The wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the light spell from it (save DC 10). The light appears warm and fiery; the effect ends early if the wand is used to cast the spell again.
