# Oil of Defoliation
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  


Sometimes known as weedkiller oil, this greasy brown fluid contains the crushed husks of dozens of locusts. One vial of the oily substance can coat one weapon or up to five pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. Once applied, the coated weapon or ammunition deals an additional `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage to plants or plant creatures on every successful hit for the next hour.

The oil can also be applied directly to a willing, helpless, or immobile plant or plant creature. In this case, the substance deals `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage, which is enough to kill most ordinary plant life smaller than a large tree.
