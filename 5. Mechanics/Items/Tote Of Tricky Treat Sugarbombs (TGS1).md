`dice: [[Tote Of Tricky Treat Sugarbombs (TGS1).md#^tricky-treat-sugarbomb-effects]]`

| dice: d20 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The candy seems to have spoiled, forcing you to succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or spend your action on your next turn retching and reeling. |
| 2 | Your face appears to melt: revealing the skull beneath it. The effect is harmless and illusory. |
| 3 | Any food you eat or water you drink taste like ash and blood, respectively. |
| 4 | Other creatures' eyes appear to be hollowed out and blackened to you. |
| 5 | Your ears turn a different, vibrant color at the start of each of your turns. |
| 6 | Your hair falls out and regrows over the next minute. |
| 7 | Your laughter becomes maniacal, and you have trouble stopping once you've started. |
| 8 | Your pupils resemble a snake's. |
| 9 | You hear a fly near your ear, but you can neither see it nor swat it away. |
| 10 | Your skin turns orange, and light spills forth from your eyes and mouth, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet. |
| 11 | Confetti bursts from the top of your head, and small children can be heard laughing. |
| 12 | You sprout tiny, flightless bat wings. |
| 13 | You know the location of the nearest pumpkin within 1 mile. |
| 14 | Nearby crows and ravens land on your shoulders or outstretched arm. |
| 15 | A friendly, floppy wizard hat appears on your head. After 1 minute, it disappears in a cloud of stars. |
| 16 | Any alcohol in your stomach or that you drink becomes nonalcoholic. |
| 17 | Your voice becomes smooth and golden, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Performance\|Performance]]) checks to sing. If you are already proficient with this skill, you add double your proficiency bonus instead. |
| 18 | Any food you eat or water you drink tastes delicious and reminds you of your favorite pastimes. |
| 19 | You gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range is increased by 30 feet. |
| 20 | You can magically sense if someone is possessed, and you can see creatures that are invisible. |
