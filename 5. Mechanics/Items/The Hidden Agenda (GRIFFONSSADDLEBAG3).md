# The Hidden Agenda
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*

This paired brooch and signet ring are typically found together in a fine wooden case, and are a favorite among elite spies and unscrupulous politicians. While wearing the brooch and ring together, you have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand\|Sleight of Hand]]) and Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]) checks. The brooch resembles a gilded quill, and the ring has a pair of feathers on either side that encircle a deep blue sapphire.

While holding or wearing the brooch, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to transform it into a golden feather quill. You gain a +5 bonus to any ability check you make with the quill to make a forgery, such as a signature or letter. While holding the quill, you can use a bonus action again to transform it back into the brooch. Alternatively, you can use the brooch as if it were a quill (without transforming it) to write a message on parchment, paper, or some other suitable material, duplicating the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Illusory Script.md\|illusory script]] spell from it. This version of the spell lasts for 24 hours, instead of its normal duration, and once the quill has been used in this way, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

While wearing the ring, you can use an action to speak its command word to shunt an object that you're holding into a special demiplane contained in the ring. The object must weigh no more than 10 pounds and be no larger than 1 foot in any direction. It remains in the demiplane until the ring is removed (either willingly or by force) or until you use an action to speak the command word again, at which point it reappears in your hand or at your feet (your choice). Only one object can be stored in the demiplane at a time, during which time the ring's sapphire softly glows. You can wear or remove the ring using an action.
