# Immovable Button
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Immovable-Button.webp#right)  


As a bonus action, you can press this iron shirt button against a piece of fabric and speak its command word, "hold". When you do, the button magically attaches to the cloth, fixing itself in place even if it is defying gravity. The button must be attached to a piece of fabric that is either unworn or worn by a willing creature. It can hold up to 500 pounds of weight and magically prevents the cloth from tearing due to tension. More weight causes the button to deactivate and fall.

A creature can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check, moving the fixed button up to 10 feet on a success. A creature can make a DC 10 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check to determine that this button is magical, and if already activated, knows that the fabric around the button can be cut away. The button remains fixed in place for 1 minute before falling. The button's magic is lost once it's been used in this way.
