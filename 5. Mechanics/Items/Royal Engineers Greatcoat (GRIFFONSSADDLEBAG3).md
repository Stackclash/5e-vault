# Royal Engineer's Greatcoat
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Royal-Engineers-Greatcoat.webp#right)  


This stained maroon greatcoat is well worn and decorated with gilded linework and screw-like buttons. You can use an action to put on or remove the coat. While wearing it, you can use an action to reach into one of its oversized sleeves and pull out one of the following sets of tools: [[5. Mechanics/Items/Carpenters Tools.md\|carpenter's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Leatherworkers Tools.md\|leatherworker's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Masons Tools.md\|mason's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Potters Tools.md\|potter's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Smiths Tools.md\|smith's tools]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Tinkers Tools.md\|tinker's tools]], or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Woodcarvers Tools.md\|woodcarver's tools]]. The tools remain until you pull another set from the coat's sleeves, until they're more than 15 feet away from you, or until you remove the coat. You gain a +1 bonus to any ability check you make using a set of tools pulled from the coat.

In addition, if you cast a spell that normally restores hit points to one or more creatures, you can choose to target a damaged construct or object with the spell. If you target a construct, it regains hit points as if it were a living creature. If you target an object, it regains half the number of hit points from the spell and magically repairs itself.
