# Gauntlets of the Midnight Leopard
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Gauntlets-of-the-Midnight-Leopard.webp#right)  


These dark purple leather gloves are lined with a matching leopard's fur. While wearing them, your eyes shimmer in the dark, like a cat's, and you have a climbing speed of 30 feet.

Short, diamond claws are attached to the gauntlets' fingertips. While wearing them, you can use a bonus action to retract or extend the claws. While extended, the clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a damage die of `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) (unless the damage of your unarmed strikes is already higher).

## Pounce

When you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action while wearing these gauntlets, you can replace any of your normal attacks with a special unarmed strike. When you do, you leap up to 15 feet away, provided you have the movement to do so, and any opportunity attack against you is made with disadvantage. At the end of the leap, you can immediately make an unarmed strike against a target within your reach. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. The target automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it's more than one size larger than you, if you moved less than 15 feet when leaping, or if you've already hit the target with an unarmed strike on this turn.
