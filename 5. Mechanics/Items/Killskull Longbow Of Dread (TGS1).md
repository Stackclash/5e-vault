This magic longbow is adorned with a bear skull and claws. The bow holds up to 4 charges and gains 1 charge whenever you reduce a Small or larger creature to 0 hit points with it. For each charge the bow has, a small, etched line appears on the bear skull adorning the weapon. An etched line vanishes from the skull when its charge is expended.

When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause that creature to take an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) psychic damage and make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
