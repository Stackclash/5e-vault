# Snow Rider's Sleigh
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Snow-Riders-Sleigh.webp#right)  


This magic sled moves effortlessly over land as if it were covered in fresh snow and sends small flurries of illusory snowflakes behind it as it travels.
