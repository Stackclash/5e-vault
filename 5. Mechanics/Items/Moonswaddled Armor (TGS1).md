# Moonswaddled Armor
*Major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Moonswaddled-Armor.webp#right)  


This comfortable set of armor grants additional protection and respite when worn at night. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor between dusk and dawn, and when you would normally roll 1 or more Hit Dice to restore hit points when taking a short rest after dusk, you instead use the highest number possible for each Hit Die spent.
