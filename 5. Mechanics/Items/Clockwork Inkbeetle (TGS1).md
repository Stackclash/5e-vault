# Clockwork Inkbeetle
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Clockwork-Inkbeetle.webp#right)  


This minuscule, mechanical beetle is 1 inch long and quietly whirs with a mix of magical and mechanical forces. Placing the beetle on a piece of parchment you hold or carry causes it to spring to life and begin tracking your travels. As you move, so does the beetle: leaving behind a small line of ink. The ink immediately dries and doesn't dissolve in water. In addition, the beetle's small frame allows it to move even while enclosed in a book or similar enclosure without losing its sense of movement or direction.

The beetle mirrors your movement to create a to-scale map of your journey, drawing 1 inch of ink in your choice of the following scales: 20 feet/inch, 200 feet/inch, 2 miles/ inch, or 20 miles/inch. You can rotate the dial on the beetle's underside to change the scale as an action. The beetle is immune to magical effects that would otherwise alter its sense of direction.

The beetle always knows which direction is north. When placed on a piece of parchment for the first time, it crouches down to stamp a small compass rose on the sheet before it begins to move. If the beetle runs out of space on the parchment to travel, it stops moving in that direction and emits a clicking sound that can be heard by creatures within 5 feet of it.

Attaching one [[5. Mechanics/Items/Bands Of The Found And Lost (TGS1).md\|Band of the Found and Lost]] to the beetle while you wear the other allows the beetle to move and trace your movements in this way from afar so long as you are both on the same plane of existence.
