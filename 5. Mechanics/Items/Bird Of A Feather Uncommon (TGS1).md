# Bird of a Feather (uncommon)
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Bird-of-a-Feather.webp#right)  


This small stuffed roc toy is filled with enchanted down. While holding onto the toy and concentrating, you magically gain a flying speed of 20 feet for up to 1 minute. The stuffed toy's weak magic can carry up to 200 pounds.

If you take any damage while flying in this way, you lose concentration on the toy and immediately start falling.

This item cannot be used again for `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) hours. It gives a happy little chirp when its magic can be used again.
