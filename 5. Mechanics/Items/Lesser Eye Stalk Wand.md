# Lesser Eye Stalk Wand
*Wand, rare, Crafted by (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This wand has 3 charges. While holding this wand, you may spend an action and 1 charge to shoot a magical ray of energy at a target within 120 feet of you. The type of ray depends on the type of gauth eye stalk that the wand was crafted from. Consult the list below to find out what your wand does.

- **1. Devour Magic Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have one of its magic items lose all magical properties until the start of your next turn. If the object is a charged item, it also loses `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) charges. Determine the affected item randomly, ignoring single-use items such as potions and scrolls.  
- **2. Enervation Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 4d8|avg|noform` (`4d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **3. Pushing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet directly away from you and have its speed halved until the start of your next turn.  
- **4. Fire Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice: 4d10|avg|noform` (`4d10`) fire damage.  
- **5. Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#paralyzed\|paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **6. Sleep Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#unconscious\|unconscious]] for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  

The wand recovers `dice: 1d2|avg|noform` (`1d2`) charges at dawn. When you use the last charge of the wand, there is a 90% chance chance that it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
