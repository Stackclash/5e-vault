# Magic Mistletoe
*Herb, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 500 gp

## Description:

A strain of mistletoe that grows in areas of high magical concentration; it was said that they were created by a spiteful lady of the feywilds in order to curse her adulterous husband. Although the man had believed himself invulnerable to all harm, the lady had discovered that he had overlooked the simple mistletoe plant. Since she could not form a weapon from it, she instead cultivated the plants until their berries produced a poison, and it is with this poison that she tainted her husband's drink, removing his magical protections in the process. Now left as exposed as any other creature, her husband perished to her dagger, which she gladly plunged into his vulnerable chest.

## Effect:

As part of preparing this herb, you must cover one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition with the juice from this plant. For the next 4 hours, any creature successfully hit by this weapon or ammunition must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for the next minute. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] in this way, a creature loses any damage resistances they may have.
