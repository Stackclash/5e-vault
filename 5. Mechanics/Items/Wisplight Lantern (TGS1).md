# Wisplight Lantern
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Wisplight-Lantern.webp#right)  


This dark hooded lantern glows with a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Will O Wisp.md\|will-o'-wisp]]'s flame that can reveal the final moments of a creature's life. The lantern sheds bright blue light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can use an action to reduce the light's reach or cover it completely.

The lantern has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d3+1|noform|avg` (`1d3 + 1`) expended charges each day at dusk. As an action while holding the lantern, you can expend 1 of its charges and touch it to a Large or smaller corpse. When you do, a ghostly blue illusion of the fallen creature appears above its corpse and silently reenacts the last 6 seconds of its conscious life. The illusion only shows the creature's actions, such as reacting to an unseen monster or trying to extinguish the flames of a fiery trap, but does not show the responsible monster or effect. This ability has no effect on undead creatures. Once a corpse's death has been shown, it cannot be shown again.

Alternatively, while holding the lantern, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to speak its command word. If there are any undead creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't behind total cover, the lantern's light flashes red before returning to its normal blue glow.
