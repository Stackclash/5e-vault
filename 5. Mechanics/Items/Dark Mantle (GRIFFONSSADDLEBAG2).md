# Dark Mantle
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Dark-Mantle.webp#right)  


This leathery cloak is made from the remains of a darkmantle. While wearing it, climbing doesn't cost you extra movement, and you have advantage on Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) check made to climb.

In addition, while wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word to emit an aura of magical darkness. This aura extends from you in a 15-foot radius, moves with you, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. A creature with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
