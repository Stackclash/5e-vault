# Soldier's Duty
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 20 gp

## Description:

A type of eucalyptus that developed a resistance to devouring insects by loading its leaves with a chemical reminiscent of ammonia. Aside from being mildly toxic, the leaves also release a sharp stench that when crushed in sufficient quantities, assaults the nose and immediately floods anyone who smells it with adrenaline. The herb is so named, as handfuls of its leaves can be found in many soldier's kits, being used as a naturally occurring smelling salt to jolt them back into a state of readiness despite any grievous injury they may have already suffered.

## Effect:

As an action, you may crush this herb in front of the nose of a creature within 5 feet of you that is on 0 hit points, causing them to regain 1 hit point.
