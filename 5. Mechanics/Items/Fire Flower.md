# Fire Flower
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A stunning red and yellow flower that grows only under harsh sunlight. While most flowers would wilt under such an environment, the fire flower uses this to its advantage by growing oily seeds which burst forth when the plant inevitably combusts, propagating itself vast distances up to a mile away. However, when these seeds are collected early and then pressed into an oil and applied to a weapon, they impart the elemental power of fire to anything that weapon strikes.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A weapon that has had this herb applied to it is considered magical and deals an additional `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage upon its first successful hit in a turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
