# Hammer of the Eternal Quake

  - Two-handed: 1d10x>9 B
- **Properties**: Crafted by, Martial, [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Strikes made with this weapon have a chance to reverberate constantly, compounding the damage you do to your target. If you roll the maximum value on a damage dice with this weapon, you may reroll that dice, adding the result to your total damage dealt. Rerolled dice may also trigger this effect, and there is no limit to how many times this effect can repeat.

In addition, while holding this hammer you may use the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action to slam its head into the ground, creating a shockwave that forces all targets within 30 feet of you to succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]]. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, this attack replaces one of them.
