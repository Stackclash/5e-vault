This heavy armor is made using salvaged pieces of a dragon turtle's shell and can fit on a variety of common mounts. Once worn, the armor expands over the course of 1 hour to cover the creature with a defensive shell and enhance its natural abilities, granting it the following benefits:

- The creature gains a +1 bonus AC.  
- The creature can breathe air and water.  
- The creature gains a swimming speed equal to its walking or flying speed, whichever is higher.
