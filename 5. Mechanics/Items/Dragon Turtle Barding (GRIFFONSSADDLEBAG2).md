# Dragon Turtle Barding
*Tack and harness, major, very rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Dragon-Turtle-Barding.webp#right)  


This heavy armor is made using salvaged pieces of a dragon turtle's shell and can fit on a variety of common mounts. Once worn, the armor expands over the course of 1 hour to cover the creature with a defensive shell and enhance its natural abilities, granting it the following benefits:

- The creature gains a +1 bonus AC.  
- The creature can breathe air and water.  
- The creature gains a swimming speed equal to its walking or flying speed, whichever is higher.
