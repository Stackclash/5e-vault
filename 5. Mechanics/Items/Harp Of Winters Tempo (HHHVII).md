# Harp of Winter's Tempo
*Wondrous item, instrument, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

You may spend your action to play this harp. If you do so, you may roll any number of your available [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) dice to target an equal number of creatures within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Until the end of the next round, those creatures have a penalty to their initiative score equal to the number you roll on your [Bardic Inspiration](compendium/classes/bard.md#Bardic%20Inspiration%20(Level%201)) dice, making separate rolls for each target. If this penalty causes a creature to fall below you in the initiative order, they do not get a new turn and that turn is instead skipped.
