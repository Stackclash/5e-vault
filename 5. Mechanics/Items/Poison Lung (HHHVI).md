# Poison Lung
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

This item resembles an iron cylinder attached to a leathery sack capable of being filled with air. While holding this item, you may spend an action to squeeze the sack to release a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas in front of you. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:10d8|noform|avg` (`10d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once used, this item may not be used again for another `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) hours.
