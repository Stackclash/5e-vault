# Masks of the Sacred Beasts (Mule)
*Wondrous item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Masks-of-the-Sacred-Beasts.webp#right)  


These dark ceramic and gold masks are fashioned after animals that are sacred in certain cultures. Each mask's appearance and properties are based on the sacred beast it represents. While attuned to a mask, you can end your attunement to it and attune to a different one over the course of 1 minute, instead of over the course of one or more short rests.

While wearing a mule mask, your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws against being knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. In addition, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to force that creature to make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].
