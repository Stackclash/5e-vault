This unearthly bow is disjointed and gruesome. It's made of an ashen, twisted wood that acts as a conduit for eldritch energy and has a series of fleshy tendrillike growths that bulge through the wood's grain. Arrows shot from this bow are destroyed once they're fired, turning into a projectile of pure energy instead. This projectile deals `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage, instead of the arrow's normal damage, and retains any magical properties of the destroyed arrow. Hit or miss, a projectile is lost after the attack.

These energy projectiles can sometimes pierce enemies. Once on each of your turns when you make an attack using this weapon, you can force another creature 10 feet directly behind the original target to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage.
