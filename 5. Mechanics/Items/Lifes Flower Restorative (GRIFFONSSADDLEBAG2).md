# Life's Flower Restorative
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement by a creature missing a hand, arm, or leg)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Lifes-Flower-Restorative.webp#right)  


This vital branch pulses with life and resembles a crude limb. To attune to this item, you must attach it to the end of your missing arm or leg, at which point the branch magically forms an elegant copy of the appendage it's replacing. This prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body and can't be removed against your will as long as you're attuned to it.

The prosthetic branch has 10 flowers and regrows `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) missing flowers daily at dawn. While attached, the branch provides these benefits:

- When you regain hit points as part of a spell or magical effect, you can choose to expend any number of flowers to regain an extra 5 hit points for each flower spent. This property can restore you to no more than half of your hit point maximum.  
- If you start your turn with 0 hit points while the prosthetic has 3 or more remaining flowers, you can choose to expend 3 flowers to regain 5 hit points. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
