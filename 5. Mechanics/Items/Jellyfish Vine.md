# Jellyfish Vine
*Herb, rare, Herb*  
![[5. Mechanics/Items/img/jellyfishvine.webp#right]]  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 200 gp

## Description:

A translucent variety of kelp that can be found in large clumps either floating across the ocean waves or washed up on the beach. It is often mistaken for a school of jellyfish, and for good reason other than its appearance, since its leaves are covered in a multitude of tiny hairs that are each loaded with a horribly caustic substance that causes painful burns when applied to exposed skin. When the herb is carefully handled and stored, these hairs remain active and can then be used as a coating on weaponry to add a stinging bite to one's strikes.

## Effect:

This herb may be applied to one melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A weapon that has had this herb applied to it is considered magical and deals an additional `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) acid damage upon its first successful hit in a turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
