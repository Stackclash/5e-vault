# Grass Carpet
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Grass-Carpet.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 30.0 lbs.

This soft roll of turf is magically fertile. Its soil is 1 inch thick and allows plants of all kinds to grow well within it. Each roll of turf is 5 feet wide and 10 feet long. Its grass and soil are self-containing and will not grow beyond the size of the carpet. The carpet is so fertile that plants growing in its soil require only half the normal amount of sunlight and water they would normally need in order to grow.

For every 1 inch of the soil's depth, the carpet provides the same amount of nutrition as normal soil does with 1 foot, allowing plants whose roots are normally 1 foot long to grow with only 1 inch of soil. Folding the carpet over for added depth, or layering multiple carpets on top of one another, increases the soil depth to allow for larger plants to grow on the carpet.

The carpet weighs 30 pounds and takes 1 minute to roll up or out. While rolled up, it has a 1-foot diameter. The carpet can be cut into smaller plots using a magical blade, with each plot measuring at least 1 foot long and wide.
