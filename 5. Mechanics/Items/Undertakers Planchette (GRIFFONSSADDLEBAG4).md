# Undertaker's Planchette
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag4/Items/Undertakers-Planchette.webp#right)  


This planchette is made of bone. You can place the planchette on a surface that has letters or premade responses written on it (such as a piece of parchment or carved table), at which point you can perform a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 minute, over the course of which you can ask a corpse within 30 feet of you one question. The creature knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the creature is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. The answer is given out slowly over the course of the ritual, moving the planchette to individual letters or responses over time. You must keep both your hands on the planchette for the duration of the ritual.

The planchette can be used in this way three times. It regains all expended uses daily at dusk. If the ritual is interrupted before the end of the minute, it still expends a use of the planchette.
