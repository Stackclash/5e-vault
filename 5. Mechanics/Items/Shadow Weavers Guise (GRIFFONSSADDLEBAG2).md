# Shadow Weaver's Guise
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Shadow-Weavers-Guise.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This patchwork gray cloak has three bone clasps at its neck. Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals damage while wearing this cloak, you can choose to change its damage type to necrotic for that casting of the spell.

## Curse

Once you don this cursed cloak, you are unwilling to remove it unless you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While wearing the cloak, you are considered to be undead whenever you are in dim light or darkness. In addition, if you can normally cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Light.md\|light]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dancing Lights.md\|dancing lights]] cantrips, you are unable to cast them while wearing the cloak.
