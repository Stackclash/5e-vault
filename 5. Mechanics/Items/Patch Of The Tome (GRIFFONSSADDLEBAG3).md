# Patch of the Tome
*Wondrous item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Patch-of-the-Tome.webp#right)  


This canvas patch can be magically attached to a piece of clothing by pressing it against the clothing for 1 minute. The patch remains on the clothing until you remove it. While it's attached to a piece of clothing, the patch's pages occasionally turn to reveal an identical one behind it.

You can remove the patch using an action to magically enhance your reading comprehension and writing skill. You read and write twice as fast for 1 hour. Further, you gain a `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) bonus to the first Intelligence check you make for the duration.

Once the patch has been removed from a piece of clothing it's attached to, the patch loses its magic and becomes a mundane patch. If the magic patch is removed from a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Robe Of Useful Items.md\|robe of useful items]], the patch has a 50 percent chance to keep its magical properties and can be reattached to a piece of clothing again.
