# Dragonkin Weapon +3
*Major, legendary (requires attunement by a dragonborn)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Dragonkin-Weapon.webp#right)  


These weapons are made of a scaly metal that radiates draconic elements. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) damage of the same type as your Breath Weapon racial trait. In addition, while attuned to the weapon, you gain a +3 bonus to your breath weapon's save DC.

The color of the weapon's metal changes to reflect your own natural colors as a dragonborn once you attune to it.
