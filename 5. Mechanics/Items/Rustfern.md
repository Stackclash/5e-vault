# Rustfern
*Herb, rare, Herb*

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp

## Description:

A particularly pesky variety of fern, easily distinguished by the copper tone of its leaves. Instead of subsisting on photosynthesis like most plants do, the rustfern has adapted to its dark cave environment by secreting a special chemical that it releases along with its spores that breaks down and destroys metal deposits in the lining of rock walls. In its new home of metallic dust, the nascent fern absorbs nutrients and then grows to start the cycle anew. If the spores are collected properly, they can be reused later in order to sabotage and destroy the armour and weapons of your enemies.

## Effect:

This herb contains `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) charges. As an action, you use a charge to blow some of the dust of this herb onto a nonmagical, ferrous metal object within 5 feet of you. If the object isn't being worn or carried, it destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the dust. If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed.
