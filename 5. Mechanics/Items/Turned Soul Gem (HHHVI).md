# Turned Soul Gem
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While you are holding this item, you may target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That target must make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the target's soul is magically trapped inside this gem. While the soul is trapped, the target's body and all the equipment it is carrying cease to exist. On a successful save, the target takes `dice:7d6|noform|avg` (`7d6`) necrotic damage, and if this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its soul is trapped as if it failed the saving throw. A soul trapped in a gem for 24 hours is devoured and ceases to exist, and this gem gains 1 charge.

If you die while holding this gem, and if this gem has at least 1 charge, you return to life within `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) days so long as the gem is in contact with you for the entire duration. If it ever leaves contact with you, the magic of the gem fades and becomes a mundane object. At the end of the `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) days, the gem loses 1 charge and you return to life as if the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Reincarnate.md\|reincarnate]] spell had been cast on you, with your new body identical to one of the creatures whose soul had been devoured by this item (chosen randomly). Once a body has been chosen, it cannot be chosen again.

Crushing this gem releases any soul trapped within, at which point the target's body re-forms in an unoccupied space nearest to the gem and in the same state as when it was trapped.
