# Enchantment Breaker
*Ring, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Enchantment-Breaker.webp#right)  


This ring's tiny chains rotate slowly around your finger while worn. Whenever you are affected by a spell that restores hit points such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cure Wounds.md\|cure wounds]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Healing Word.md\|healing word]], you can use your reaction to reattempt the saving throw against an enchantment spell that's currently affecting you.

## Shatter Enchantment

When you're targeted by an enemy enchantment spell or fail a saving throw against one, you can use your reaction to weaken the enchantment's grip on you and other allies within 10 feet of you: allowing you and nearby allies to roll the enchantment's saving throw with advantage. Once you use this feature, it can't be used again until `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) days have passed.
