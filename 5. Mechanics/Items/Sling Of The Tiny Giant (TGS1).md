# Sling of the Tiny Giant
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Sling.md\|sling]]), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Sling-of-the-Tiny-Giant.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d4 bludgeoning
- **Range**: 30/120
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]]

This wicked sling is devastating against foes larger than yourself. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and when you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this sling, the creature takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) force damage for each size larger than you it is (up to an extra `dice:3d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d4`) damage).

In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with the sling, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you and knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. If the affected creature is Large or larger, it has disadvantage on the saving throw.
