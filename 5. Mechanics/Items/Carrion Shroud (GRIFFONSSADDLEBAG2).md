# Carrion Shroud
*Wondrous item, cursed item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Cursed%20Items\|Cursed]]

This ruffled cloak of dull feathers and down grants you the resilience and cunning of a ravenous vulture. When you move while wearing this cloak, small, tattered feathers drift from the cloak that vanish when they touch the ground. While wearing the cloak, your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, you have advantage on saving throws against disease and poison, and you have resistance to poison damage.

In addition, while wearing the cloak, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to transform into a pair of sickly vulture wings for 1 minute. While the cloak is transformed, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet, and when you hit a creature that's missing any of its hit points with a melee weapon attack, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage. This property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dusk.

## Curse

This cloak is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it worn at all times. The cloak gives you an insatiable hunger for flesh, and while traditional food can sustain you, you no longer enjoy the smell or taste of it. While cursed, whenever you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you're forced to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature is a construct, ooze, plant, or undead, you automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a failed save, you are overcome with the urge to tear into the creature's flesh and feast: sacrificing any additional movement, action, or bonus action you had left on your turn. You can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of your following turns, ending your need to feast on a success.
