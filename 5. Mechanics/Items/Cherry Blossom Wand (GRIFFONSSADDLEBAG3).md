# Cherry Blossom Wand
*Wand, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Cherry-Blossom-Wand.webp#right)  


This wand has 7 charges and regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. As an action while holding the wand, you can expend 1 of its charges to target a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The air in a 20-foot cube centered on that point stirs into a light, dramatic breeze that carries a flurry of delicate pink cherry blossoms on it. The wind and the blossoms vanish immediately at the end of your turn.
