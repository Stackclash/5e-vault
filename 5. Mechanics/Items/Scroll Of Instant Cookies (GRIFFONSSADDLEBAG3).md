# Scroll of Instant Cookies
*Scroll, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Scroll-of-Instant-Cookies.webp#right)  


This 5-foot scroll of parchment is wrapped around a rolling pin. You can use an action to unroll 1 or more feet of the parchment, pressing it against a solid surface while you do. The pressed parchment immediately transforms into a pastry dough that's been freshly baked and cut into rows of delicious cookies. You choose the shape and flavor of the cookies each time you use the scroll. Every foot of scroll creates 18 cookies when pressed.

When the last of the scroll has been used, it leaves behind the rolling pin, which can be used as a magical club.
