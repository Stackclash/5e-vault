# Tlincalli Thorn
*Herb, rare, Herb*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Herb\|Herb]]
- **Cost**: 50 gp

## Description:

A particularly fierce looking cactus that grows in a hook shape resembling that of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Tlincalli.md\|tlincalli's]] scorpion-like stinger. In fact, it is this property that makes this herb curious to magi-botanists, as the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Tlincalli.md\|tlincalli]] themselves are instinctively drawn to these plants and will prioritise laying their eggs among themw henever possible. Unfortunately, no scholar has managed to interview a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Tlincalli.md\|tlincalli]] and discover what connection (if any) they have to this plant, but the current theory is that the two specimens shaped each other's developmentâ€”with the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Tlincalli.md\|tlincalli]] protecting the plant from harm, while in exchange, the strange venoms inherent in the needles of the plant are what give the young [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Tlincalli.md\|tlincalli]] the hard exoskeletons that protect them in their most vulnerable years.

## Effect:

For 4 hours after preparing this herb, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC as your skin becomes exceptionally hard and scale-like.
