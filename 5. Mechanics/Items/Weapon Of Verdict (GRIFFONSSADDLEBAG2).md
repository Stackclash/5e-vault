# Weapon of Verdict
*Major, uncommon (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Weapon-of-Verdict.webp#right)  


These polished wooden weapons are traditionally used by the clerics and paladins of a righteous order to punish evildoers and aid the needy. Each of these magic weapons is blessed by a powerful priest or celestial. A weapon of verdict has 3 charges and regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) charges daily at dawn. You can use these charges to create the following effects:

## Condemn

When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra  `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage to the target.

## Commend

As an action, you can expend 1 charge to touch a creature other than yourself with this weapon to restore `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) hit points to that creature.
