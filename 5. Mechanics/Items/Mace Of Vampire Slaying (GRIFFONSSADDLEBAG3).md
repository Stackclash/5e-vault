# Mace of Vampire Slaying
*Weapon ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Mace.md\|mace]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Mace-of-Vampire-Slaying.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This weapon is made from a vampire's skull and impaled with various wooden stakes. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a vampire.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with the weapon, the target takes an extra 10 necrotic damage as the skull bites down on the target. You then gain 10 temporary hit points, which remain for 1 minute. Alternatively, if the target is a vampire, it instead takes an extra 10 piercing damage from the attack and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of your next turn. You don't gain temporary hit points in this way if the target is a vampire.
