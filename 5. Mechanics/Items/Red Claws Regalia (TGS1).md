# Red Claw's Regalia
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Red-Claws-Regalia.webp#right)  


This dragon scale robe is miraculously insulated and comfortable. While wearing the robe, you gain the following benefits:

- You can withstand temperatures as low as âˆ’50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.  
- Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.  
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.  
- You have resistance to fire damage.  
- You can stand on and walk across molten rock, unharmed, as if it were solid ground.  

The hem of this robe glimmers with slowly shifting embers. While wearing the robe, your steps leave behind small motes of harmless fire and scorched earth that disappear after 1 second.
