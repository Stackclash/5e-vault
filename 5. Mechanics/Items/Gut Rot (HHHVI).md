# Gut Rot
*Potion, common*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with the disease [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#Gut%20Rot\|gut rot]]. While afflicted with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#Gut%20Rot\|gut rot]], any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer `dice:4|noform|avg` (`4`) necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Diseases.md#Gut%20Rot\|gut rot]], a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Violet Fung(US).md\|violet fungus]] sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) days.
