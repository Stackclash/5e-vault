# Midnight Tears
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Poison\|Poison]]
- **Cost**: 1,500 gp

A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:9d6|noform|avg|text(31)` (`9d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
