# Snake Oil
*Potion, minor*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Snake-Oil.webp#right)  


Snake oil is an unreliable concoction of alchemy, druidic knowledge, and luck. When found, the potion's rarity is random: Common (90 percent) or Rare (10 percent). Only an [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Identify.md\|identify]] spell or similar magic can determine the rarity of the potion.

When you use an action to drink the potion, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) to determine its effects based on the rarity of the potion. Unless it says otherwise, an effect remains for 1 hour. If the potion is a rare variant, it gains both the Common and Rare effects of the potion.

`dice: [[Snake Oil (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md#^common-rare]]`

| dice: d6 | Common | Rare |
|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Nothing happens. | Nothing happens. |
| 2 | Your eyes become yellow and reptilian. | You have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet for 1d4 hours. |
| 3 | Your tongue becomes forked. | You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell for 24 hours. |
| 4 | Your skin becomes scaled, like a snake. | You have resistance to poison and acid damage. |
| 5 | Your footsteps create gentle rattling noises. | You gain the benefits of the freedom of movement spell. |
| 6 | Whenever you make an 'S' sound, it's pronounced like a hiss. | You grow snakelike fangs. You can use a bonus action to make a bite attack using these fangs. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage, plus an extra 2d8 poison damage. |
