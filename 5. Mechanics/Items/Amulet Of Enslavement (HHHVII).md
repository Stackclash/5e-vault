# Amulet of Enslavement
*Wondrous item, rare*  

- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]

While you are wearing this amulet, any [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charm]] effect that currently afflicts you is considered to have an infinite duration instead of its usual duration. Once this amulet has been worn for a cumulative total of 24 hours, it crumbles into dust and becomes worthless.
