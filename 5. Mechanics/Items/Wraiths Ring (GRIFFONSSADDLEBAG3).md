# Wraith's Ring
*Ring, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag3/Wraiths-Ring.webp#right)  


This ring is made of four shrunken, skeletal fingers that clamp around yours while worn. One of the fingers holds a cracked black pearl, from which faint tufts of smoke curl up. While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, your forearms and hands appear magically skeletal and ghostly. The effects are illusory.

While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] spell from it, using a spell attack bonus of +5. This version of the spell uses your level to determine the spell's damage, instead of only casting it at its lowest level. You gain a +1 bonus to the spell's attack and damage rolls if you're in dim light, or a +2 bonus if you're in darkness. In addition, while you're in dim light or darkness, you can choose to cast the spell as a melee attack, instead of a ranged one, against a target within your reach. If you already know the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chill Touch.md\|chill touch]] spell, you can still gain these benefits even if you cast the spell without using the ring.

## Wraith's Ensemble

Dying doesn't end your attunement to this magic item. In addition, if you're attuned to three items with this named property, you treat bright light (but not sunlight) as if it were dim light or darkness for the purposes of the items' various properties, and you can use a bonus action to reveal or suppress one or more of the items' visual effects. While an item's visual effects are suppressed, you don't gain the benefits of that item's other properties.
