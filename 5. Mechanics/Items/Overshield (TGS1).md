# Overshield
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/TGS1/Overshield.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this large shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. The bonus becomes +2 while you have at least 1 temporary hit point. While you have temporary hit points, the shield emits a slight blue glow.

In addition, you can channel the heroic resolve within the shield as an action to gain `dice:1d6+8|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 8`) temporary hit points. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
