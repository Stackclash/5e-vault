# Antimagic Shield
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Crafted%20by\|Crafted by]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While wearing this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you succeed on your saving throw against a spell, or if a spell attack misses you, an additional effect might occur, as determined by rolling a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`):

- **1-2.** If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only you, it has no effect on you and is reflected back at the caster, using the spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.  
- **3-4.** No additional effect.  
- **5-6.** The shield converts some of the spell's energy into a burst of destructive force. Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) force damage per level of the spell on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

This shield loses all its magical properties 1 month after being crafted. After this point, the shield may be reused to create a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Spellguard Shield.md\|spellguard shield]], counting for 2,000 gp of the crafting cost.
