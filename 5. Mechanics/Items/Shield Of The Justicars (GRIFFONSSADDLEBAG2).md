# Shield of the Justicars
*Armor ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Shield.md\|shield]]), major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/GriffonsSaddlebag2/Items/Shield-of-the-Justicars.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

One of the original arms from the Upheaval, this shield can be used to release a magically discordant pulse. While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

In addition, the shield has 4 charges and regains `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield's charges and speak its command word. When you do, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes a â€“2 penalty to its spell attack bonus and saving throw DC until the end of the turn, including against the triggering spell.
