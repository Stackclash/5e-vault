- **Damage**: 1 piercing
- **Range**: 25/100
- **Properties**: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Ammunition\|Ammunition]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Loading\|Loading]]
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This magic blowgun is made from a rough spruce branch. At its end is a collection of sharp porcupine quills. The blowgun has 30 quills and regains all expended quills daily at dawn; it then loads itself with 6 of those quills, unless it was already loaded with other ammunition.

If the blowgun is loaded with 6 quills in this way, it shoots each of those quills simultaneously at the same target when you make a ranged attack with it. You still make a single attack roll with the blowgun when you do, and you add your Dexterity modifier to the total of the attack's damage. On a hit, roll a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) to determine how many of the quills hit the target; you then roll a number of d4s equal to the result, and the target takes piercing damage equal to the total of the d4s. At the end of the turn, the blowgun magically reloads itself with 6 new quills, unless you already loaded it with other ammunition.

The blowgun can also be wielded as a magic club. While it has at least 6 quills remaining, it deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) piercing damage to any target it hits.
