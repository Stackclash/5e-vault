# Talisman of Nature's Wrath
*Wondrous Item, very rare, Crafted by (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Properties**: Crafted by

This talisman has 4 charges and channels energy from the elemental plane, bolstering your magic with primal power. If you cast a spell that deals either fire, cold, lightning, or thunder damage, you may expend a charge in order to give that spell an additional effect as determined by its damage type:

## Fire

Any creature that received fire damage from your spell is set ablaze and suffers `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage at the end of their turn unless they, or an adjacent creature, spends their action to pat the fire out.

## Cold

Any creature that received cold damage from your spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have their speed halved until the end of your next turn.

## Lightning

Any creature that received lightning damage from your spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn.

## Thunder

Any creature that received thunder damage from your spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone until the start of your next turn.

This item regains all expended charges at dawn.
