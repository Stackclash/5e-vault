# Soul Channeler
*Source: Deep Magic p. 158*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]] and either [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]]  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** Artisan's tools ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Supplies.md\|alchemist's supplies]]), [[5. Mechanics/Items/Poisoners Kit.md\|poisoner's kit]]  
- **Languages.** Infernal or Abyssal  
- **Equipment.** A set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Supplies.md\|alchemist's supplies]], a pocket knife, a piece of chalk connected to a string, a chapbook of esoteric symbols, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp  

A quirk of fate, or a circumstance of birth, exposed you to the intoxicating power of Arcane Magic and changed you irrevocably. You spent your formative years learning about yourself, gauging your inner reserves and how much you are willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals.

## Feature: Channel Essence

You can call upon your inner reserves to recover from debilitating, long-term Injuries. As part of a short rest, you can offset a reduction to one of your ability scores by expending a number of Hit Dice equal to twice the amount of the reduction that you want to negate. When used in this manner, the Hit Dice do not confer other benefits, such as additional hit points.

## Suggested Characteristics

Soul channelers are drawn to the Dark Arts and the manipulation of available resources to achieve their goals. For some this might include using their own capabilities, but an easier (and more common) method employs summoned creatures, Undead servants, and duped allies. Not every soul channeler chooses to exploit such opportunities, but the Temptation is there for all.
