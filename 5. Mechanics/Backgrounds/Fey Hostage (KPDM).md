# Fey Hostage
*Source: Deep Magic p. 156*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of gaming set, one type of musical instrument  
- **Languages.** Elvish, Sylvan  
- **Equipment.** A flower with petals that will never wilt, a musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Fine Clothes.md\|fine clothes]], and a pouch containing 10 gp  

Years, possibly centuries, ago you were captured by the fey. Each host, as the fey called themselves, treated their "guest" differently. The Relationship you forged with your captors defines you just as strongly as the circumstances of your abduction and of your Escape or release. You have been indelibly marked—emotionally, psychically, and physically—by the fey and their Special brand of hospitality.

## Life-changing Event

The fey have a multitude of reasons for abducting—or rescuing—folk like you, and it's also possible that you or others did something to bring about your situation. Choose or randomly determine the reason behind your sojourn in the realm of the fey.

|----------|-------|
| 1 | My Childhood was tithed to the fey by my Family in return for prosperity for as long I remained in their care. |
| 2 | I made a bargain with a fox to play with its cubs in their den. The fox turned out to be an emissary of the Summer Court, and I was not released until the cubs came of age. |
| 3 | Centuries ago my ancestors were rulers and made a political alliance with the fey in exchange for tribute to be paid every third generation. We are no longer rulers, but the fey still demand their tithe. |
| 4 | I have no memories of my past before I was taken by the fey. |
| 5 | I wandered into an ancient, primeval wood shortly after learning to walk and was found by the fey, who took me in. |
| 6 | A fey child befriended me and invited me to their home. |
| 7 | I am the only Survivor of a fey raid. They killed my parents, but spared me for their own unknowable reasons. |
| 8 | My parents could not care for me, and their choices were to abandon me in a Forest or a city. They chose the Forest. |

## Feature: First Impressions

You were raised in a situation in which failing to adhere to the nuances, niceties, and intrigues of the fey court could have catastrophic repercussions. The first impressions one makes set the tone for future endeavors. You have learned that lesson well, and continue to apply it. In your initial social interaction with an individual fey, you gain a +2 bonus to the first Charisma-based check you make.

## Suggested Characteristics

A fey hostage will never forget the events that led to their capture, the treatment they experienced, or the circumstances of their release. Their experiences with the unpredictable fey might range from whimsical to pathological.
