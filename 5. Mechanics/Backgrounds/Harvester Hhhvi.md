# Harvester
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 146*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** Nature, Survival  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|Harvesting Kit]]  
- **Languages.** One of your choice  
- **Equipment.** A set of traveller's clothes, a hunting trap, [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]], a cloak made from a creature you harvested, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp.  

Like a miner in their cave or a farmer in their field, you too make your living through reaping the riches of the natural world. Your resources, however, are the monsters and creatures that populate the multiverse. Although there are some who would scoff and call you a mere butcher, you understand the subtle complexities in the fantastical anatomies you find in your adventures, and only you are qualified enough to harvest them.

## Feature: Connected

You have been harvesting creatures for a long time and as part of that, you have become deeply acquainted with the large industry of crafters and merchants that rely on the wares you bring. Whenever you enter a place of civilisation, you have no trouble finding merchants willing to buy your materials or crafters that can work with your wares. You are also savvy in the bargaining techniques used when haggling over prices and are not easily tricked during negotiations. You often find yourself able to secure a good price, or even a discount on services relating to harvested materials.

## Suggested Characteristics

Harvesters are an odd bunch; half outdoorsman, half entrepreneur. As someone who spends most of their time in the hunting and being elbow deep in dead bodies, you probably have a different worldview compared to most.

|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I am often covered in blood and viscera, which other people find off-putting. |
| 2 | I see no moral issue about harvesting any once-living creature, even if they were clearly sentient. "Waste not, want not", after all. |
| 3 | I often unnerve people with my discussions of the more disgusting aspects of creature anatomy. |
| 4 | I am obsessed with self-sufficiency; anything I wear must have come from something I harvested. |
| 5 | I say a small prayer before harvesting a fresh kill, thanking it for its sacrifice. |
| 6 | The hunt is what excites me more than anything. Harvesting is just how I keep mementos of my prey. |
| 7 | I insist on using every little bit of what I kill, it would be an insult to that creature's life otherwise. |
| 8 | I have a myriad of harvested trophies from rare game which I show off whenever possible. |

| 1 | **Life.** Harvested meat will feed the hungry, harvested furs will warm the cold. Through death, comes life. (Good) |
| 2 | **Honor.** I refuse to use something harvested from a creature that I did not kill with my own hands. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Necessity.** Creatures kill and harvest other creatures to survive. You may not like it, but it's just the way things are. (Neutral) |
| 4 | **Opportunity.** If something is already dead, what's the point of letting its corpse go to waste? (Chaotic) |
| 5 | **Dominance.** Nothing shows off your strength like having your own Owlbear-head trophy. (Evil) |
| 6 | **Money.** People always want hides, pelts, and skins; I may as well be the one to profit off it. (Any) |

| 1 | My clan won't respect me unless I bring back the head of a rare and dangerous creature. |
| 2 | Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of wearing a unicorn fur cloak. If you have a better way of getting one, I'd like to hear it. |
| 3 | Hunting and harvesting creatures is the only way I know how to make money and feed my family. |
| 4 | Visions of a monstrously large creature haunt my dreams. They won't stop until I find it and claim its pelt for my cloak. |
| 5 | I am interested in studying the anatomy of rare and magical creatures and I need samples to continue my research. |
| 6 | Harvesting creatures has been my family's profession for generations; I'm just continuing this long line of tradition. |

| 1 | Once I decide that a creature will become my next trophy, nothing will stop me from getting it. |
| 2 | Some would say I get a little too much pleasure in slicing corpses open and tearing out their fresh organs. |
| 3 | I'm always looking for the next big hunt, something that will probably get me killed. |
| 4 | I tend to exaggerate the quality of my harvested wares to inflate their price. |
| 5 | Once I kill something, I will drop everything to take a trophy from it before moving on. |
| 6 | I see other living creatures as just organs in a skin bag, waiting to be sold. |
