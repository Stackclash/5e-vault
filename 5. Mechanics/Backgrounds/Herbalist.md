From even before the discovery of farming, society has relied on the gifts that nature grows from its soil and the herbalists that gather and harness those gifts.

Herbalists are naturally close to nature, venturing out into the wilds to gather plants that can heal the sick, lend vigour to the weak, and even create magical effects that would make the most powerful of mages jealous.

## Feature: Ripe Pickings

As an experienced herbalist, you know the best spots to find ripe plants, and the best techniques to gather them without wasting any of the precious resources inside. Whenever you gather a herb that has charges, that herb always starts with the maximum number of charges possible.

## Suggested Characteristics

Since their livelihood relies on a flourishing wild, herbalists tend to have a reverence for nature and hold a respect for the natural cycle of life. While most do live among others as healers or alchemists, they spend the majority of their time outdoors and alone, which can often lead to some eccentric traits.

|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Naturalism.** I believe that there is nothing that the gifts of nature cannot solve, and that civilisation only tends to get in its way. (Any) |
| 2 | **Sustainability.** Plant life must be controlled and maintained by sentient creatures so that their uses may continue to serve us. (Lawful) |
| 3 | **Wrath.** Plants are actually some of the deadliest organisms in the world, their only issue is that they can't move. That's where I come in. (Evil) |
| 4 | **Discovery.** I am travelling the world to document and research the plants I find, and hopefully discover a new one myself. (Neutral) |
| 5 | **Conservation.** I have joined the war on nature, on the side of nature. Anyone that would try to harm the plants must go through me first. (Chaotic) |
| 6 | **Healing.** There is no need for the common people to suffer from illness so long as nature provides cures and I am there to find them. (Good) |

| 1 | I am a student of science and I want field research in gathering and applying herbs in real-life situations. |
| 2 | I seek a plant that can cure an illness that has plagued my home village for generations. |
| 3 | In order to prove my honour and bravery, I am searching for a legendary plant to bring back and present to the elders of my hometown. |
| 4 | My goal is to make enough money to retire to my own plot of land, where I will spend my time growing the exotic herbs I found on my journey. |
| 5 | I will sow the seeds of my favourite flower wherever I go and ensure the world blooms with its beauty. |
| 6 | As an infant, my life was saved when a wandering herbalist used medicinal plants to break my fever. I vow to bring the same natural healing to everyone in the same way. |

|----------|------|
| 1 | I am regularly covered in dirt and fertiliser that many find off putting. |
| 2 | I value plant life over animal life and I will gladly sacrifice the latter to save the former. |
| 3 | I consider all plants to be sentient beings and I have to ask them permission before I do anything that would damage them. |
| 4 | Secretly, I have little regard to the sustainability of gathering too many herbs—all I care is what use they have to serve me. |
| 5 | I can become very distracted if I see a herb that I want, and I will drop everything else to go get it. |
| 6 | I refuse to believe that there is a problem that can't be solved by the right plant—even if it's really obvious this isn't a situation that calls for them. |
