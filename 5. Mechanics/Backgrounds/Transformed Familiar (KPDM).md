# Transformed Familiar
*Source: Deep Magic p. 159*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** Artisan's tools ([[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Supplies.md\|alchemist's kit]])  
- **Languages.** One of your choice  
- **Equipment.** A trinket worn or carried by your previous form, a set of traveler's clothes, an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Alchemists Supplies.md\|alchemist's kit]], an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Explorers Pack.md\|explorer's pack]], and a pouch containing 5 gp  

Your connection to magic began with a term of service, or servitude, to a magician of power. Your partnership continued as expected for years, until the bond was abruptly broken. In the aftermath, you found yourself with a new body. Despite your new appearance, your actions often betray your Origin. The struggle between what you have become and what you once were rages within you.

## Life-changing Event

You were previously a different kind of creature. How you became what you are, and what you know of your former existence, can vary greatly depending on the circumstances. Choose or randomly determine the lifechanging event that brought about your transformation.

| dice: d8 | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | My bond was severed and my form irrevocably changed in a surge of wild, uncontrolled magic that claimed the life of the mage who called me their familiar. |
| 2 | The Pact of the Chain between my warlock and myself was dissolved unexpectedly with their passing. Their patron, not wanting to lose two advocates, granted me my current form as a reward for services rendered, and expects me to continue their works. |
| 3 | My service to, and partnership with, a mage of great power and cunning was rewarded with transmogrification into my new body. |
| 4 | I awoke in an unfamiliar body, with only dream-like memories of my prior service to a being of great arcane ability. |
| 5 | I broke my bond with my master, replacing it with a pledge of service to a higher power. Part of the bargain was providing me with a new form to more easily hide from my past. |
| 6 | I stood by my master's side as aide, ally, and advisor until an unknown enemy severed our connection, robbed me of my true body, and captured my master. |
| 7 | My master, infirm with age and senility, unintentionally released me and altered my body in an attempt to rejuvenate themselves. |
| 8 | I betrayed my master in a time of crisis, and their last act was to transform me into my current form, robbing me of my natural body forever. |

## Feature: Familiar Insight

You are a transformed familiar, and although your physical form has changed, you will never forsake the instincts and insights you were born with. When interacting with creatures of your original type, you have a +2 bonus on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]]) checks to detect their motives and the veracity of their claims.

## Suggested Characteristics

Transformed familiars often display Personality Traits and Quirks that are holdovers from their prior lives. They might hold to these affectations consciously, or without realizing their behavior is unusual. Either way, every transformed familiar carries their past with them in some manner.
