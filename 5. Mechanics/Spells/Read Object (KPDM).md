# Read Object
*2nd-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

By handling an object and reading the psychic residue on it, you can divine information about the item's history. After you cast the spell, you continue to handle the object, reading any impressions that might be left upon it. Each round, the GM may give you one piece of information related to the item's ownership and handling. The GM might determine that a particular item does not have enough psychic residue to provide any clear impressions. The following are examples of information you can obtain through use of this spell:

- The item's name, if it has one  
- A visual image of the last creature to handle the item  
- An impression of the emotional state of the creature that last used the item  
- If the item is a weapon, or has been used as a weapon, an image of the last creature injured or killed by it  
- A visual image of the item's owner or crafter  
- Information regarding the item's historical significance, if any
