# Thunderclap
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot Radius)
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You clap your hands, emitting a peal of thunder. Each creature within 20 feet of you takes `dice:8d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d4`) thunder damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] for `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) rounds, or it takes half as much damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. On a saving throw that fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] for 1 round.

This spell doesn't function in an area affected by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Silence.md\|silence]] spell. Very brittle material such as crystal might be shattered if it's within range, at the GM's discretion; a character holding such an object can protect it from harm by making a successful Dexterity saving throw.
