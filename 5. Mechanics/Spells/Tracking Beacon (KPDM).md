# Tracking Beacon
*3rd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You choose a creature within range to mark with a glowing orb of light, which floats 120 feet above the creature's head. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the light hovers above the target's location, moving as the target moves, which enables you to track the creature's direction and distance by staying within sight of the beacon. The beacon continues to function even when you cannot see it, as long as the target remains on the same plane as you. If either you or the target travels to another plane, the spell ends.

You can use a bonus action on your turn to adjust the height of the beacon, ranging from its starting point of 120 feet to as low as 5 feet above the head of the target.
