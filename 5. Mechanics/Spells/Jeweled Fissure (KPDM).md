# Jeweled Fissure
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of jasper)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

With a sweeping gesture, you cause jagged crystals to burst from the ground and hurtle directly upward. Choose an origin point within the spell's range that you can see. Starting from that point, the crystals burst out of the ground along a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line and up to 100 feet above it takes `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) thunder damage plus `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) piercing damage; a successful Dexterity saving throw negates the piercing damage.

On a failed save, a creature is impaled by a chunk of crystal that halves the creature's speed, prevents it from flying, and causes it to fall to the ground if it was flying. To remove a crystal, the creature or an ally within 5 feet of it must use an action and make a DC 13 Strength check. On a successful check, the impaled creature takes `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) piercing damage and its speed and flying ability are restored to normal.
