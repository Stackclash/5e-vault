# Wayward Strike
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a tear in the fabric of reality that protects you from an incoming attack by directing it through a second tear close to a creature you can see up within range. The attack plunges into one dimensional tear and out the other one, causing it to be resolved against that creature's AC. If the attack is successful, the creature takes the appropriate damage. You can even make the attacker hit itself, if you choose.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]
