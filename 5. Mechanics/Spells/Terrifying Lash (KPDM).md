# Terrifying Lash
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 0 minutes

A faintly luminous whip of energy coalesces in your hand. The whip has 10 ft. of reach, and you can take an action to make a melee attack roll against a target on your turn, using your spellcasting ability modifier as a bonus on the attack roll.

On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] for `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) rounds. If you attack a target with this spell that is already [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], you gain advantage on the attack roll, and the target has disadvantage on its Wisdom saving throw.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Warlock.md\|Warlock]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
