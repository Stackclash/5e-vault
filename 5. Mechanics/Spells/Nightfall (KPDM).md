# Nightfall
*3rd-level, Evocation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call upon night to arrive ahead of schedule. With a sharp word, you create a 30-foot-radius cylinder of night centered on a point on the ground within range. The cylinder extends vertically for 100 feet or until it reaches an obstruction, such as a ceiling. The area inside the cylinder is normal darkness, and thus heavily obscured. Creatures inside the darkened cylinder can see illuminated areas outside the cylinder normally.
