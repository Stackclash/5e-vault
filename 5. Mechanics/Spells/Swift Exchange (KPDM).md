# Swift Exchange
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you or another creature you can see within range is the target of a weapon attack or a spell attack, you can magically switch your position with that of the other creature in an instant. If the creature is unwilling, it can make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. Otherwise, you and the creature change positions, each appearing in an eyeblink at the location the other previously occupied. Any attack that was about to occur against you or the other creature is resolved against whichever one of you now occupies the targeted space.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
