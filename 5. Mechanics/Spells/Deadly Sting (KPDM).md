# Deadly Sting
*8th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a thorn
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You grow a 10-foot-long tail as supple as a whip, tipped with a horrible stinger. As part of the casting of this spell and as an action on each of your subsequent turns, you can use the stinger to make a melee spell attack with a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) piercing damage plus `dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`) poison damage, and a creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become vulnerable to poison damage for the duration of the spell.
