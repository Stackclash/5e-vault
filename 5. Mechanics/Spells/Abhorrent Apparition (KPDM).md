# Abhorrent Apparition
*4th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** a gourd with a face carved on it
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) psychic damage and becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) for each slot level above 4th.
