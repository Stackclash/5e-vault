# Fault Line
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

The ground thrusts sharply upward along a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line that you designate. All spaces affected by the spell become difficult terrain. In addition, all creatures in the affected area are knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and take `dice:8d6|noform|avg` (`8d6`) bludgeoning damage. Creatures that make a successful Dexterity saving throw take half as much damage and are not knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. This spell doesn't damage permanent structures.
