# Sudden Stampede
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a horseshoe)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You conjure up a multitude of fey spirits that manifest as galloping horses. These horses run in a 10-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line, in a given direction starting from a point within range, trampling all creatures in their path, before vanishing again. Each creature in the line takes `dice:6d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d10`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half, and the creature is not knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].
