# Glyph of Shifting
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered diamond worth at least 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You create a hidden glyph by tracing it on a surface or object that you touch. When you cast the spell, you can also choose a location that's known to you, within 5 miles, and on the same plane of existence, to serve as the destination for the glyph's shifting effect.

The glyph is triggered when it's touched by a creature that's not aware of its presence. The triggering creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to the glyph's destination. If no destination was set, the creature takes `dice:4d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d4`) force damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

The glyph disappears after being triggered or when the spell's duration expires.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, its duration increases by 24 hours and the maximum distance to the destination increases by 5 miles for each slot level above 2nd.
