# Keening Wail
*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a ringed lock of hair from an undead creature)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You emit an unholy shriek from beyond the grave. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature with 50 hit points or fewer fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is instead reduced to 0 hit points. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each slot level above 4th.
