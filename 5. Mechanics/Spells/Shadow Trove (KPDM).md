# Shadow Trove
*3rd-level, Transmutation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, S, ink made from the blood of a raven
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You paint a small door approximately 2 feet square on a hard surface to create a portal into the void of space. The portal "peels off " the surface you painted it on and follows you when you move, always floating in the air within 5 feet of you. An icy chill flows out from the portal. You can place up to 750 pounds of nonliving matter in the portal, where it stays suspended in the frigid void until you withdraw it. Items that are still inside the shadow trove when the duration ends spill out onto the ground. You can designate a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier who have access to the shadow trove; only you and those creatures can move objects into the portal.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 2 hours for each slot level above 3rd.
