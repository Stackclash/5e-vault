# Scry Ambush
*4th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You foresee your foe's strike a split second before it occurs. When you cast this spell successfully, you also designate a number of your allies that can see or hear you equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act normally in the first round of combat.

If you would be surprised, you must make a check using your spellcasting ability at the moment your reaction would be triggered. The check DC is equal to the current initiative count. On a failed check, you are surprised and can't use your reaction to cast this spell until after your next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction to cast this spell immediately.
