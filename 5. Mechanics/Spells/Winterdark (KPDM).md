# Winterdark
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell invokes the deepest part of night on the winter solstice. You target a 40-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range, which is plunged into darkness and unbearable cold. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of its turn must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage and gain one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. Creatures immune to cold damage are also immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] effect, as are creatures wearing cold weather gear or otherwise adapted for a cold environment.

As a bonus action, you can move the center of the effect 20 feet.
