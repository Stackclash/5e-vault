# Staff of Violet Fire
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, mummy dust
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a quarterstaff of pure necrotic energy that blazes with intense purple light; it appears in your chosen hand. If you let it go, it disappears, though you can evoke it again as a bonus action if you have maintained concentration on the spell.

This staff is an extremely unstable and impermanent magic item; it has 10 charges and does not require attunement. The wielder can use one of three effects:

- By using your action to make a melee attack and expending 1 charge, you can attack with it. On a hit, the target takes `dice:5d10|noform|avg` (`5d10`) necrotic damage.  
- By expending 2 charges, you can release bolts of necrotic fire against up to 3 targets as ranged attacks for `dice:1d8+4|noform|avg` (`1d8 + 4`) necrotic damage each.  

The staff disappears and the spell ends when all the staff's charges have been expended or if you stop concentrating on the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the melee damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(1d10)` for every two slot levels above 4th, or you add one additional ranged bolt for every two slot levels above 4th.
