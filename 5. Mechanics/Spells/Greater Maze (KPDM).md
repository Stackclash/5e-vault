# Greater Maze
*9th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

This spell functions as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Maze.md\|maze]], but the target must make a Dexterity saving throw each time it starts its turn in the maze. The target takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

Escaping this maze is especially difficult. To do so, the target must use an action to make a DC 20 Intelligence check. It escapes when it makes its second successful check.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
