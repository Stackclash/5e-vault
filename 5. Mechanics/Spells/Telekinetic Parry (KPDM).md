# Telekinetic Parry
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction

- **Components:** S

As a reaction, you use a brief burst of kinetic energy to block an attack against you. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. An attack that hits deals damage as normal. This spell works against melee and ranged attacks, as well as spell attacks that have a physical manifestation, including force effects, but not against spells that do not require an attack roll.
