# Desolation
*8th-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, an obsidian acorn worth 500 gp, which is consumed in the casting
- **Duration:** 1 year

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon plants, such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Entangle.md\|entangle]], require an ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by *desolation*.

After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.

A living creature that finishes a short rest within the area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. *Desolation* counters the effects of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bloom (KPDM).md\|bloom]] spell.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.
