# Goat's Hoof Charm
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a goat's hoof
- **Duration:** 1 minute

A creature you touch traverses craggy slopes with the surefootedness of a mountain goat. When ascending a slope that would normally be difficult terrain for it, the target can move at its full speed instead. The target also gains a +2 bonus on Dexterity checks and saving throws to prevent falling, to catch a ledge or otherwise stop a fall, or to move along a narrow ledge.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can increase the duration by 1 minute, or you can affect one additional creature, for each slot level above 1st.
