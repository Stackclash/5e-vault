# Star's Heart
*9th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V, S, an ioun stone
- **Duration:** 1 minute

This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50-foot radius centered on you. Each creature in the area other than you drops whatever it's holding, falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]], becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]], and can't move. If a solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling damage. Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:8d6|noform|avg` (`8d6`) bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes half as much damage, it's no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]], and it can move at half speed.

All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Flaming Sphere.md\|flaming sphere]]. A creature under the influence of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Freedom Of Movement.md\|freedom of movement]] spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn't reduced once it recovers from being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]].
