# Investiture of Flame
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Flames race across your body, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the spell's duration. The flames don't harm you. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You are immune to fire damage and have resistance to cold damage.  
- Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage.  
- You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
