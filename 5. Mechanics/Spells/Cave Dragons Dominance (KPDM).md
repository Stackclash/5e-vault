# Cave Dragon's Dominance
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You take on some of the physical characteristics and abilities of a cave dragon (Tome of Beasts, pg. 125), growing protective scales and claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can't be lower than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing, and you have resistance to poison damage. You can take an action on your turn to attack twice with your claws, each as a melee spell attack dealing `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) slashing damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier on a hit. You also gain a climbing speed of 40 feet, and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] out to a range of 60 feet.

Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of poison gas, dealing `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) poison damage to each creature in the cone and making it [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until it finishes a short rest. A creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon and is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].
