# Kiss of the Succubus
*5th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You kiss a willing creature or one you have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or held spellbound through spells or abilities such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Person.md\|dominate person]]. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice:5d10|noform|avg` (`5d10`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken; this reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(1d10)` for each slot level above 5th.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer Divine Soul (XGE)\|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric Lust Domain (KPDM)\|Cleric (Lust Domain)]]
