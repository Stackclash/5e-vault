# Drain Item
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a magic item and cause its magical energies to drain away. If the item is currently carried or held by another creature, you must make a melee spell attack to touch the item, against the wielder's AC. On a hit, the item loses `dice:1d3|noform|noparens|avg` (`d3`) charges. If this reduction drops the item's charges to 0, any effects that occur when the item loses all its charges immediately take effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can drain more charges from an item: `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) for a 5th-level slot, `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) for a 6th-level slot, `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) for a 7th-level slot, or `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) for an 8th- or 9th-level slot.
