# Find Traps
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Alarm.md\|alarm]] spell, a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Glyph Of Warding.md\|glyph of warding]], or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
