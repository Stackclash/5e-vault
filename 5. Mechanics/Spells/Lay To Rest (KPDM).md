# Lay to Rest
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of grave dirt)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A pulse of searing light rushes out from you. Each undead creature within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes `dice:8d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d6`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

An undead creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell disintegrates in a burst of radiant motes, leaving anything it was wearing or carrying in the space it formerly occupied.
