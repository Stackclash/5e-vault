# Life Drain
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

With a snarled word of Void Speech, you create a swirling vortex of purple energy. Choose a point you can see within range. Creatures within 15 feet of the point take `dice:10d6|noform|avg` (`10d6`) necrotic damage, or half that damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. For each creature damaged by the spell, you can choose one other creature within range, including yourself, that is not a construct or undead. The secondary targets regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage you dealt.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the vortex's damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 6th.
