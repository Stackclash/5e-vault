# Magnetize
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a lodestone
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You magnetize a large piece of metal or stone (such as a door, a stone pillar, or a 5-foot-square section of floor) that you touch, giving it a powerful attraction to ferrous metal. Any iron objects within 50 feet of the target that are not fastened down or being held or worn are pulled toward it, moving against or up to the target and remaining there. Any creature located between such an object and the magnet might be struck; roll a ranged spell attack against the target's AC. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) damage of the appropriate type (bludgeoning for a hammer, slashing or piercing for a sword, and so forth).

Objects held by or in the possession of a creature are also attracted. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to retain a grip on any held or worn objects. On a successful save, the creature retains possession of the object, but is dragged 5 feet closer to the magnet. A creature can voluntarily release a metal object in its possession and forgo a save.

Creatures garbed in mostly metal armor, or made of metal, are also attracted to the magnet, and have disadvantage on their saving throws to avoid being pulled toward it. If such a creature succeeds on its saving throw, it can move away from the magnet on its turn, but the area within 50 feet of the magnet is considered difficult terrain. If the creature is still in this area at the start of its next turn, it must make another successful saving throw to avoid being drawn toward the magnet. A creature that comes into contact with the magnet is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]]. It can negate this condition by using an action and succeeding on a Strength check against your spell save DC to remove itself from the magnet.
