# Raise Elder
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell is identical to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Dead.md\|raise dead]], but it works only on a creature that died of old age. The spell grants the raised elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less potent than a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] can restore these lost points. In all other respects, the creature can live out its life normally until the added year elapses.

*Raise elder* has no effect if it's cast on the same creature a second time.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]
