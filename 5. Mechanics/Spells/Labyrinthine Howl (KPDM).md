# Labyrinthine Howl
*5th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a dead mouse)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You let loose the howl of a ravenous beast, causing each enemy within range that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature believes it has been transported into a labyrinth and is under attack by savage beasts. An affected creature must choose either to face the beasts or to curl into a ball for protection. A creature that faces the beasts takes `dice:7d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`7d8`) psychic damage, and then the spell ends on it. A creature that curls into a ball falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d8)` for each slot level above 5th.
