# Compelling Fate
*3rd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V, a sprinkling of silver dust worth 20 gp
- **Duration:** 1 round

You view the actions of a single creature you can see through the influence of the stars, and you read what is written there. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you can predict that creature's actions. This has the following effects:

- You have advantage on attack rolls against the target.  
- For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the target's turn when it has completed its movement. This is deducted from your next turn's movement.  
- As a reaction at the start of the target's turn, you can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the target's offensive intentions; any creature targeted by the target's next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its saving throw against that attack.  

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.
