# Biting Arrow
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, an arrow or a thrown weapon
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a ranged weapon attack with a bow, a crossbow, or a thrown weapon. The effect is limited to a range of 120 feet despite the weapon's range, and the attack is made with disadvantage if the target is in the weapon's long range, as per usual.

If the weapon attack hits, it deals damage as usual. In addition, the target becomes coated in thin frost until the start of your next turn. If the target uses its reaction before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage and the spell ends.

The spell's damage, for both the ranged attack and the cold damage, increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:+1d6|noform|avg` (`+ 1d6`) and `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`)), 11th level (`dice:+2d6|noform|avg` (`+ 2d6`) and `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`)), and 17th level (`dice:+3d6|noform|avg` (`+ 3d6`) and `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`)).
