# Create Bonfire
*cantrip, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

The spell's damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg` (`3d8`)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg` (`4d8`)).
