# Enumerate
*cantrip, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You are able to divine the exact amount of a number of like objects in a 10-foot-cube centered on a point within range. You can be general ("How many coins in this chest?") or specific ("How many silver coins in this chest?") but can receive only one number as a response from the casting of this spell. If, for example, you want to know the number of coins of each denomination in a chest, you must cast the spell anew for each type of coin to be counted (copper, silver, gold, and so forth).
