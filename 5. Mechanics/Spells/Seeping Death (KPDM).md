# Seeping Death
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 3 day

Your touch inflicts a virulent, flesh-eating disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the creature's Dexterity score is reduced by `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`), and it is afflicted with the *seeping death* disease for the duration.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it and can end the spell early.

**Seeping Death**. The creature's flesh is slowly liquefied by a lingering necrotic pestilence. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`). The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies.
