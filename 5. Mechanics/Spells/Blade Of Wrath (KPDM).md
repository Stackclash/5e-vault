# Blade of Wrath
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a rebuke of evil, written in Celestial
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You create a sword of pure white fire in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and it lasts for the duration. The blade disappears if you let go of it, but you can call it forth again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the blade. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage and `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) radiant damage. An aberration, fey, fiend, or undead creature damaged by the blade must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] until the start of your next turn.

The blade sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, either the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 3rd.
