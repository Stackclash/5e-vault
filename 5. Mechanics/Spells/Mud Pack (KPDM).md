# Mud Pack
*1st-level, Conjuration (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a clump of mud
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell covers you or a willing creature you touch in mud consistent with the surrounding terrain. For the duration, the spell protects the target from extreme cold and heat, allowing the target to automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws against environmental hazards related to temperature. In addition, the target has advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks while traveling at a slow pace in the terrain related to the component for this spell.

If the target is subject to heavy precipitation for 1 minute, the precipitation removes the mud, ending the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is 8 hours and you can target up to ten willing creatures within 30 feet of you.
