# Cloak of Fiendish Menace
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You wrap yourself in an aura of fiendish power, intimidating those that face you. When a creature is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]]. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] creature can make another saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, the creature is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] and cannot again be affected by this particular casting of the spell.

If you deal damage to a creature that is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] by this spell, it must take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action and move away from you by the safest available route on its next turn, unless there is nowhere to move. The creature is unable to move toward you again while the spell is in effect, unless it makes a successful saving throw against the spell.
