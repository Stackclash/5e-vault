# Time Jump
*8th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a construct and throw it forward in time if it fails a Constitution saving throw. The construct disappears for `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) rounds, during which time it cannot act or be acted upon in any way. When the construct returns, it is unaware that any time has passed.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
