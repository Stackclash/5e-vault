# Spike Growth
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
