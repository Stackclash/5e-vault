# Reaver Spirit
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You inspire allies to fight with the savagery of berserkers. You and any allies you can see within range have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and a +2 bonus to damage with melee weapons.

When the spell ends, each affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) levels of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]].

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus to damage increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.
