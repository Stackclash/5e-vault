# Servant of Doom
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A force of destruction gifts you a portion of its power. Each time you cast this spell, you choose whether to assume the form of the emissary or the form of the envoy for the duration.

## Emissary

The blood in your veins shines through your skin, extra eyes open in your flesh, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to hover, though you must stay within 5 feet of the ground.  
- You gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Truesight\|truesight]] out to a range of 60 feet.  
- Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your spells and abilities.  
- You have advantage on Intelligence- or Wisdom-based attack rolls.  

## Envoy

Your skin becomes stonelike, bony growths erupt across your body, and you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore difficult terrain for movement purposes.  
- You can move through walls and other solid barriers if you succeed on a Strength check you make just before moving up to the barrier. The DC equals 10 + twice the barrier's thickness in feet.  
- You have advantage on Strength- or Dexterity-based attack rolls.  
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) slashing damage on a hit.
