# Flame Blade
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, leaf of sumac
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for every two slot levels above 2nd.
