# Rune of Imprisonment
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, ink
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You trace a glowing black rune in the air which streaks toward and envelops its target. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a successful hit, the rune absorbs the target creature, leaving only the glowing rune hanging in the space the target occupied. The subject can take no actions while imprisoned, nor can the subject be targeted or affected by any means. Any spell durations or conditions affecting the creature are postponed until the creature is freed. A dying creature does not lose hit points or stabilize until freed.

A creature adjacent to the rune can use an action to attempt to disrupt its energies; doing so allows the imprisoned creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, this disruption negates the imprisonment and ends the effect. Disruption can be attempted only once per round.
