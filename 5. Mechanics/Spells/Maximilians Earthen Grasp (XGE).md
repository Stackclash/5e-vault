# Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature hand sculpted from clay
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] for the spell's duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] target if you do either.
