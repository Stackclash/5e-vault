# Conjure Fiends
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon fiends that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. You choose one of the following options for what appears:

- One fiend of challenge rating 2 or lower  
- Two fiends of challenge rating 1 or lower  
- Four fiends of challenge rating 1/2 or lower  
- Eight fiends of challenge rating 1/4 or lower  

A fiend summoned by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The GM has the creatures' statistics.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level spell slot and three times as many with an 8th-level spell slot.
