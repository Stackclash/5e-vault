# Caustic Torrent
*8th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S, a chip of bone pitted by acid
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A swirling jet of acid sprays from you in a direction you choose. The acid fills a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes `dice:14d6|noform|avg` (`14d6`) acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature other than you that's in the line or within 5 feet of it is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute by toxic fumes. Creatures that don't breathe or that are immune to acid damage aren't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]]. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] creature can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
