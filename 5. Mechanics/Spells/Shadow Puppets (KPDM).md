# Shadow Puppets
*2nd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a pinch of powdered lead
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You animate the shadow of a creature within range, causing it to attack that creature. As a bonus action when you cast the spell, or as an action on subsequent rounds while you maintain concentration, make a melee spell attack against the creature. If it hits, the target takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) psychic damage and must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 2nd.
