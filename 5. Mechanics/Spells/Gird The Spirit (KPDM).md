# Gird the Spirit
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Your magic protects the target creature from the life-sapping energies of the undead. For the duration, the target has immunity to effects from undead creatures that reduce its ability scores, such as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Shadow.md\|shadow]]'s Strength Drain, or its hit point maximum, such as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Specter.md\|specter]]'s Life Drain. This spell doesn't prevent damage from those attacks; it prevents only the reduction in ability score or hit point maximum.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Druid\|Druid]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer Divine Soul (XGE)\|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]
