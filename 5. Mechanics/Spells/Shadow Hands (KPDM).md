# Shadow Hands
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A freezing blast of shadow explodes out from you in a 10-foot cone. Any creature caught in the shadow takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) necrotic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage dealt by the attack increases by `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d4)` for each slot level above 1st.
