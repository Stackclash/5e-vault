# Ensnaring Strike
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by this spell, the target takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Oath Of The Ancients.md\|Paladin (Oath of the Ancients)]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Ranger.md\|Ranger]]
