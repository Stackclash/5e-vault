# Scribe
*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell enables you to create a copy of a one-page written work by placing a blank piece of paper or parchment near the work that you are copying. All the writing, illustrations, and other elements in the original are reproduced in the new document, in your handwriting or drawing style. The new medium must be large enough to accommodate the original source. Any magical properties of the original aren't reproduced, so you can't use scribe to make copies of spell scrolls or magic books.
