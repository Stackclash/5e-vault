# Hoarfrost
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a melee weapon
- **Duration:** 1 minute

A melee weapon you are holding is imbued with cold. For the duration, a rime of frost covers the weapon and light vapor rises from it if the temperature is above freezing.

The weapon becomes magical and deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) cold damage on a successful hit. The spell ends after 1 minute, or earlier if you make a successful attack with the weapon or let go of it.

The spell's damage increases by `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`)), 11th level (`dice:3d4|noform|avg` (`3d4`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d4|noform|avg` (`4d4`)).
