# Icy Manipulation
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of ice preserved from the plane of elemental ice)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]] (frozen solid). A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it makes two successful saves. If a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]] creature gets two failures on the saving throw (not counting the original failure that caused the petrification), the petrification becomes permanent.

The petrification also becomes permanent if you maintain concentration on this spell for a full minute. A permanently [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]]/frozen creature can be restored to normal with [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] or comparable magic, or by casting this spell on the creature again and maintaining concentration for a full minute.

If the frozen creature is damaged or broken before it recovers from being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]], the injury carries over to its normal state.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
