# Nether Weapon
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, ink, chalk, or some other writing medium
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You whisper in Void Speech and touch a weapon. Until the spell ends, the weapon turns black, becomes magical if it wasn't before, and deals `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage (in addition to its normal damage) on a successful hit. A creature that takes necrotic damage from the enchanted weapon can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 4th.
