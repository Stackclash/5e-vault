# Draconic Smite
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon takes on the form of a silver dragon's head. Your attack deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage, and up to four other creatures of your choosing within 30 feet of the attack's target must each make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra cold damage and the cold damage dealt to the secondary creatures increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Druid\|Druid]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]
