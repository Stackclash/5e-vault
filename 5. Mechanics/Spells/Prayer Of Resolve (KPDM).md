# Prayer of Resolve
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You remind your allies of the perseverance that will be required of them. Each of up to six creatures you can see within range gains temporary hit points equal to `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. The temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the temporary hit points gained by each creature increase by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each slot level above 2nd.
