# Sunburst
*8th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, fire and a piece of sunstone
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:12d6|noform|avg` (`12d6`) radiant damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]].

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
