# Contagion
*5th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 7 day

Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].

At the end of each of the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] target's turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

## Blinding Sickness

Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]].

## Filth Fever

A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

## Flesh Rot

The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

## Mindfire

The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell during combat.

## Seizure

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

## Slimy Doom

The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of its next turn.
