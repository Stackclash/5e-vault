# Fire Darts
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a fire the size of a small campfire or larger)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When this spell is cast on any fire that's at least as large as a small campfire or cooking fire, three darts of flame shoot out from the fire toward creatures within 30 feet of the fire. Darts can be directed against the same or separate targets as the caster chooses. Each dart deals `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) fire damage, or half as much damage if its target makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each slot level above 2nd.
