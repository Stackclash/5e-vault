# Raid the Lair
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of the dragon whose lair you are raiding
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] circle of protective energy centered on yourself with a radius of 10 feet. This field moves with you. The caster and all allies within the energy field are protected against dragons' lair actions:

- Attack rolls resulting directly from lair actions are made with disadvantage.  
- Saving throws resulting directly from lair actions are made with advantage, and damage done by these lair actions are halved.  
- Lair actions occur on an initiative count 10 lower than normal.  

The caster has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on this spell.
