# Shadow Monsters
*4th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a doll)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose up to two creatures within range. Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature perceives its allies as hostile, shadowy monsters, and it must attack its nearest ally. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
