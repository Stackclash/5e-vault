# Glimpse of the Void
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a scrap of parchment with Void glyph scrawlings
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Muttering Void Speech, you force images of terror and nonexistence upon your foes. Each creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature goes insane for the duration. While insane, a creature takes no actions other than to shriek, wail, gibber, and babble unintelligibly. The GM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
