# Poisonous Flesh
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of milkweed)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You make your flesh and blood poisonous, deterring creatures that might want to devour you. For the duration, any creature that hits you with a bite attack must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]]. Creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or higher will not willingly bite you again, seeking other prey instead. If such a creature is unable to disengage from combat with you, it will use other attack actions to deal damage if possible, but will continue to use its bite attack if it has no other option.

If you are swallowed by a creature, immediately after you take whatever damage is dealt by the creature's digestion, the creature takes `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) poison damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 hour. A successful Constitution saving throw negates the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] condition. On its next turn, the creature uses an action to spit you out.
