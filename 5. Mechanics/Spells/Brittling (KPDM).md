# Brittling
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, an icicle
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell uses biting cold to make a metal or stone object you touch become brittle and more easily shattered. The object's hit points are reduced by a number equal to your level as a spellcaster, and Strength checks to shatter or break the object are made with advantage if they occur within 1 minute of the spell's casting. If the object isn't shattered during this time, it reverts to the state it was in before the spell was cast.
