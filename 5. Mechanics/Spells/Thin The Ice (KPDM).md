# Thin the Ice
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of sunstone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You target a point within range. That point becomes the top center of a cylinder 10 feet in radius and 40 feet deep. All ice inside that area melts immediately. The uppermost layer of ice seems to remain intact and sturdy, but it covers a 40-foot-deep pit filled with ice water. A successful Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check or passive [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]] check against your spell save DC notices the thin ice.

If a creature weighing more than 20 pounds (or a greater weight specified by you when casting the spell) treads over the cylinder or is already standing on it, the ice gives way. Unless the creature makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it falls into the icy water, taking `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage plus whatever other problems are caused by water, by armor, or by being drenched in a freezing environment. The water gradually refreezes normally.
