# Phantom Light
*2nd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a small sketch of a candle
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one object that measures less than 10 feet in every dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. At the time of the casting, you designate up to six creatures. Only those creatures are able to see and gain benefit from the phantom light.

The object can be covered with something opaque to block the light. You can use an action to dismiss this spell.
