# Cloak of Vermin
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of dead flies)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure a writhing garment of living insects that protect you and harm your foes. While the spell is active, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the insects lash out, dealing `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) piercing damage to the attacker.

As a bonus action, you can command your cloak to leave your body, becoming a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Insects.md\|swarm of insects]], and enter the space of an adjacent foe. The swarm attacks that foe until you use a bonus action to command it to return to you, the foe moves more than 5 feet away from you, the spell ends, or the swarm dies. You lose the protective benefit of the cloak when using it in this fashion.
