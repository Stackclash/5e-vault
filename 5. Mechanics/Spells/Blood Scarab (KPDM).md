# Blood Scarab
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, a drop of the caster's blood, and the exoskeleton of a scarab beetle
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Your blood is absorbed into the beetle's exoskeleton to form a beautiful, ruby-like scarab that flies toward a creature of your choice within range. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of scarabs increases by one for each slot level above 1st. You can direct the scarabs at the same target or at different targets. Each target makes a single saving throw, regardless of the number of scarabs targeting it.
