# Phase Bolt
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (100-feet line)
- **Components:** S, a bit of colored glass
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You focus ambient energy into a crackling bolt 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) force damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

The bolt passes through the first inanimate object in its path, and creatures on the other side of it receive no benefit from cover. The bolt stops if it strikes a second object.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bolt's damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 3rd.
