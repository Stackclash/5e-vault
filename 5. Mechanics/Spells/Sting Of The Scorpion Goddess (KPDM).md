# Sting of the Scorpion Goddess
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a live scorpion)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You grow a large scorpion's tail, complete with venomous stinger. While the spell is in effect, you can use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack with the stinger against an opponent within 5 feet. On a hit, you deal `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) piercing damage and `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage, and the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. A creature hit by your stinger attack makes a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes just half the poison damage and is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Cleric.md\|Cleric]]
