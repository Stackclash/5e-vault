# Sting of the Scorpion Goddess
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a live scorpion
- **Duration:** 10 minute

You grow a large scorpion's tail, complete with venomous stinger. While the spell is in effect, you can use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack with the stinger against an opponent within 5 feet. On a hit, you deal `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage and `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage, and the target is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. A creature hit by your stinger attack makes a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes just half the poison damage and is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]
