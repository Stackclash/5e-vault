# Living Shadows
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You whisper sibilant words of Void Speech that cause shadows to writhe with unholy life. Choose a point you can see within range. Writhing shadows spread out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, grasping at creatures in the area. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the shadows. A creature that starts its turn [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the shadows must make a successful Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]].

A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric Void Domain (KPDM)\|Cleric (Void Domain)]]
