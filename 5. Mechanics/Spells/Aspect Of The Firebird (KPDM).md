# Aspect of the Firebird
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lit candle and the tail feather of a bird)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You take on the aspect of a firebird (Tome of Beasts, p. 201), including some physical attributes. A fiery mantle descends upon you, resembling feathery wings and an expansive tail. You gain immunity to fire and a flying speed of 60 feet. Any creatures within 5 feet of you gain immunity to natural, environmental cold.

As an action, you can emit a blast of light 5 feet wide and 50 feet long. All creatures in its path take `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) fire damage and are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] for `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) rounds. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. Each time you use this feature of the spell, its duration is reduced by 1 hour. When you expend the last hour of the duration, the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
