# Quicksilver Mantle
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a nonmagical cloak and a dram of quicksilver worth 10 gp
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You transform an ordinary cloak into a highly reflective, silvery garment. This mantle increases your AC by 2 and grants advantage on saving throws against gaze attacks. In addition, whenever you are struck by a ray such as a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Enfeeblement.md\|ray of enfeeblement]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scorching Ray.md\|scorching ray]], or even [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Disintegrate.md\|disintegrate]], roll `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`). On a result of 4, the cloak deflects the ray, which instead strikes a randomly selected target within 10 feet of you. The cloak deflects only the first ray that strikes it each round; rays after the first affect you as normal.
