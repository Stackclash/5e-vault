# Bloom
*8th-level, Conjuration (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 1 miles
- **Components:** V, S, M (a silver acorn worth 500 gp, which is consumed in the casting)
- **Duration:** 1 year

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

You plant a silver acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of praises to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes extremely fertile, regardless of its previous state. Any seeds planted in the area grow at twice the natural rate. Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.

Choose one of the following effects, which appears and grows immediately:

- A field planted with vegetables of your choice, ready for harvest.  
- A thick forest of stout trees and ample undergrowth.  
- A grassland with wildflowers and fodder for grazing.  
- An orchard of fruit trees of your choice, growing in orderly rows and ready for harvest.  

Living creatures that take a short rest within the area of a *bloom* spell receive the maximum hit points for Hit Dice expended. *Bloom* counters the effects of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Desolation (KPDM).md\|desolation]] spell.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.
