# Gliding Step
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minute

Provided you're not carrying more of a load than your carrying capacity permits, you can walk on the surface of snow rather than wading through it, and you ignore its effect on movement. Ice supports your weight no matter how thin it is, and you can travel on ice as if you were wearing ice skates. You still leave tracks normally while under these effects.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration increases by 10 minutes for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Druid\|Druid]]; [[List Spells Classes Ranger\|Ranger]]
