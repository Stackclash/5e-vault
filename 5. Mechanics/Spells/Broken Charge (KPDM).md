# Broken Charge
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When an enemy that you can see moves to within 5 feet of you, you utter a perplexing word that alters the foe's course. The enemy must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) psychic damage and use the remainder of its speed to move in a direction of your choosing.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the target takes an additional `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d4)` psychic damage for each slot level above 1st.
