# Booming Blade
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (5-feet radius)
- **Components:** S, a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp
- **Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) thunder damage, and the spell ends.

This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`). Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (`dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) and `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`)) and again at 17th level (`dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) and `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`)).
