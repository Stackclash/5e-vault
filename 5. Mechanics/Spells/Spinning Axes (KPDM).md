# Spinning Axes
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, an iron ring
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Spinning axes made of luminous force burst out from you to strike all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each of those creatures takes `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) force damage, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures damaged by this spell that aren't undead or constructs begin bleeding. A bleeding creature takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute. A creature can stop the bleeding for itself or another creature by using an action to make a successful Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Medicine\|Medicine]]) check against your spell save DC or by applying any amount of magical healing.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 4th.
