# Batsense
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bat's ear)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration of the spell, a creature you touch can produce and interpret squeaking sounds used for echolocation, giving it [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] out to a range of 60 feet. The target cannot use its [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] while [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], and its [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]] doesn't penetrate areas of magical silence. While using [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Blindsight\|blindsight]], the target has disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks that rely on being silent. Additionally, the target has advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on hearing.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Druid.md\|Druid]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Ranger.md\|Ranger]]
