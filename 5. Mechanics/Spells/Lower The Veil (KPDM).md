# Lower the Veil
*8th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a strip of thin gauze or other sheer material)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly drop the veil of reality for selected targets, allowing a brief glimpse into the deep nothing beyond this realm to shatter their minds. Each creature you choose within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:8d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d10`) psychic damage and be driven insane for 10 minutes, per the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Symbol.md\|symbol]] spell. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half the damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] for 1 round. Creatures already suffering from insanity are immune to this spell. Blindness, however, is not a defense, since the experience is not sight-based, but an internal awareness.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Cleric.md\|Cleric]]
