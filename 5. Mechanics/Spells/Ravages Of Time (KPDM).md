# Ravages of Time
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a wilted flower)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You accelerate the aging of one creature within range, causing it to take on the state of a decrepit version of its type. The target suffers three levels of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] that cannot be removed by normal means. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spell partially reverses the effect of this spell, removing one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. Constructs and undead are unaffected by this spell, and creatures who live to great age without negative effects, such as dragons, are also unaffected.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Cleric.md\|Cleric]]
