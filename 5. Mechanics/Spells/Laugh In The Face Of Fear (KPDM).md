# Laugh in the Face of Fear
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You instill up to six creatures within range with the ability to laugh at something that would normally frighten them. An affected creature has advantage on saving throws against any spell or effect that causes the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition. When a creature protected by this spell succeeds on such a saving throw, it can—if it has the mentality and capability to do so—laugh at the creature that caused the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of the one who laughed. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition lasts as long as that creature can see or hear the creature who laughed, or until the spell's duration expires.
