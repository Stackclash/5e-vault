# Thunderous Wave
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You initiate a shock wave centered at a point you designate within range. The wave explodes outward into a 30-foot-radius sphere. This force deals no damage directly, but every creature the wave passes through must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 30 feet and knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]; if it strikes a solid obstruction, it also takes `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, a creature is pushed 15 feet and not knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]], and an obstruction takes half as much damage. The spell also emits a thunderous boom that can be heard within 400 feet.
