# Color Spray
*1st-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue
- **Duration:** 1 round

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll `dice:6d10|noform|avg` (`6d10`); the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional `dice:2d10|noform|avg|text(2d10)` for each slot level above 1st.
