# Guiding Star
*1st-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minutes unless cast as a ritual

- **Components:** V, S

By observing the stars or the position of the sun, you are able to determine the cardinal directions, as well as the direction and distance to a stated destination. You can't become directionally disoriented or lose track of the destination. The spell doesn't, however, reveal the best route to your destination or warn you about deep gorges, flooded rivers, or other impassable or treacherous terrain.
