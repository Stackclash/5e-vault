# Nourishing Repast
*1st-level, Transmutation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hour

You touch a supply of food and turn it into a magical substance that promotes healing and health. Enough food for up to six creatures can be transformed by the spell. The effects of the spell last for 24 hours or until the food is eaten.

If the food is eaten during a short rest, it provides a +1 bonus to each Hit Die spent to regain hit points. If the food is eaten as part of a long rest instead, then each creature partaking in the meal gains advantage on saving throws against disease or poison for the next 8 hours.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]
