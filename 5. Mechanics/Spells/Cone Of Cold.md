# Cone of Cold
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a small crystal or glass cone
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice:8d8|noform|avg` (`8d8`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 5th.
