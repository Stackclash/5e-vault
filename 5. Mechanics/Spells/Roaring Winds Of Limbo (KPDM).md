# Roaring Winds of Limbo
*8th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tear open a breach to the planes of chaos, and the act of doing so fills an area with a dangerous windstorm. The area consists of twelve 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face in common with a face of another cube. Each creature in the area is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], and any sound it makes cannot be heard outside the area. The wind disperses all gases and vapors and extinguishes all unprotected flames in the area, and has a 75 percent chance of extinguishing protected flames, such as lanterns. All Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight made by a creature in the area have disadvantage due to the dust, grit, and debris being cast about.

Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 15 feet in a random direction. (Roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`), designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.) The wind also hampers movement; a creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can bombard up to twelve creatures in the area with flying debris, dealing `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) bludgeoning, `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) piercing, and `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) slashing damage. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage.
