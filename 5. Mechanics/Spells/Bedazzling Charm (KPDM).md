# Bedazzling Charm
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by a third humanoid you designate that both of you can see.

The spell ends after 1 minute, when you or any of your companions do anything harmful to either of the spell's targets, or when the third humanoid disappears from the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature's sight. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature regards the third creature as a friendly acquaintance and will follow it to keep it within sight. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was bedazzled by you to regard the third creature favorably.
