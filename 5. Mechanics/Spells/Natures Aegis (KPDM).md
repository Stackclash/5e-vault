# Nature's Aegis
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (an area of natural vegetation)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

Grass, vines, branches, and other vegetation weave themselves over your body into a temporary suit of armor. The armor weighs 8 pounds, gives you an Armor Class of 14 + your Dexterity modifier, and provides you with advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks made to hide in the terrain from which you used the vegetation. You can use an action to dismiss this spell, which causes the armor to degrade back into its former natural vegetation.
