# Blood Armor
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

When you strike a foe with a melee weapon attack, you can immediately cast this spell as a bonus action (you cannot cast this spell any other way). The foe you struck must contain blood; if the target doesn't bleed, the spell ends without effect. The blood flowing from your foe magically increases in volume and forms a suit of armor around you, granting you an Armor Class of 18 + your Dexterity modifier for the spell's duration. This armor has no Strength requirement, doesn't hinder spellcasting, and doesn't incur disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks.

If the creature you struck was a celestial, blood armor also grants you advantage on Charisma saving throws for the duration of the spell.
