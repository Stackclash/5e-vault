# Enchant Ring
*6th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (500 gp worth of diamond dust, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You enchant a ring you touch that isn't being worn or carried. The next creature that willingly wears the ring becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 week or until it is harmed by you or one of your allies. If the creature dons the ring while directly threatened by you or one of your allies, the spell fails.

The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature regards you as a friend. When the spell ends, it doesn't know it was [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you, but it does realize that its attitude toward you has changed (possibly greatly) in a short time. How the creature reacts to you and regards you in the future is up to the GM.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
