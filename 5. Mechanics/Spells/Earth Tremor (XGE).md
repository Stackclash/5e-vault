# Earth Tremor
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]]. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
