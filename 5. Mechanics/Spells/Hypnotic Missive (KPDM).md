# Hypnotic Missive
*2nd-level, Enchantment (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, ink made with powdered amber, worth at least 50 gp
- **Duration:** 14 day

You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful enchantment that lasts for the duration. What is actually written is unimportant; the enchantment laid upon the words works on the mind of a creature that reads it, convincing the creature that there is some importance to the message that must be discovered. A creature that reads the message must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to continue reading and rereading the writing, attempting to glean its meaning and importance.

During combat, a creature so enthralled it can take no actions or reactions on its turn, but can move if it chooses or needs to do so (to remove itself from danger, for example). A creature under the influence of the hypnotic missive can make a new saving throw against the effects at the beginning of its turn if in a combat situation. In nonthreatening conditions, the creature can make a new saving throw against the effects every hour.

Once a creature has made a successful save, it recognizes the magical compulsion that has affected it. This does not provide immunity from the spell, however, and if the creature reads the words again, it must make another save or fall under the spell's effects once more.
