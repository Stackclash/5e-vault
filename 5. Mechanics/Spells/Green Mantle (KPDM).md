# Green Mantle
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a plant from the surrounding terrain)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You take on the physical characteristics of the terrain around you. In a forest, grass and tiny mushrooms sprout in your hair, moss beards your chin, and your flesh takes on the mottled hue of leaf green and bark brown. In an arctic grassland, gray lichens and the various shades of boreal grasses cloak your presence. This effect provides a +2 bonus to [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]] checks in the appropriate terrain.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, one additional creature is affected for each slot level above 1st.
