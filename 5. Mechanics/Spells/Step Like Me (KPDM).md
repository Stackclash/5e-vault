# Step Like Me
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, blood, hair, or a personal item of target
- **Duration:** 24 hour

Choose a creature within one size category of yourself that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or you steal its footsteps. For the duration of the spell, you leave the tracks of the target, while it leaves tracks as if it were you. In addition, those capable of identifying creatures through tremorsense mistake you for a creature of the target's kind.
