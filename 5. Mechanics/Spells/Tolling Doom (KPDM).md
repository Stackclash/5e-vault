# Tolling Doom
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a bronze bell
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A deep, tolling bell seems to ring from somewhere above and beyond, judging your enemies and foretelling their impending doom. Up to eight creatures that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the result from the attack roll or saving throw. You gain advantage on any attack against a target that has failed its saving throw against this spell.

This spell has no effect on a target that has an Intelligence score lower than 3.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can affect one additional target for each slot level above 6th.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]
