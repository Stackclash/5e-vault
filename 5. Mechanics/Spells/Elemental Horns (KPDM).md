# Elemental Horns
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a brass wand)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The target of this spell must be a creature that has horns, or the spell fails. This spell causes the touched creature's horns to crackle with elemental energy. Select one of the following energy types when casting this spell: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or radiant. The creature's gore attack deals `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) damage of the chosen type in addition to any other damage the attack normally deals.

Although commonly seen among tieflings and minotaurs, this spell is rarely employed by other races.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) for each slot level above 2nd.
