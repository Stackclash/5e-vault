The target of this spell must be a creature that has horns, or the spell fails. This spell causes the touched creature's horns to crackle with elemental energy. Select one of the following energy types when casting this spell: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or radiant. The creature's gore attack deals `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) damage of the chosen type in addition to any other damage the attack normally deals.

Although commonly seen among tieflings and minotaurs, this spell is rarely employed by other races.
