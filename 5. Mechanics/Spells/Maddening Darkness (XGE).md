# Maddening Darkness
*8th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking `dice:8d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d8`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Warlock.md\|Warlock]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
