# Flame Wave
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (40-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a drop of tar, pitch, or oil
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A rushing burst of fire rips out from you in a rolling wave, filling a 40-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) fire damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you on a failed save; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 3rd.
