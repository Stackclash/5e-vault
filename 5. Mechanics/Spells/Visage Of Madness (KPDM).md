# Visage of Madness
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, your face momentarily becomes that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies mad. Every foe that's within 30 feet of you and that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature claws savagely at its eyes, dealing piercing damage to itself equal to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) + the creature's Strength modifier. The creature is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of its next turn and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. A creature that rolls maximum damage against itself (a 6 on the `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`)) is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] permanently.
