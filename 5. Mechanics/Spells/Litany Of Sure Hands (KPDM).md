# Litany of Sure Hands
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

This spell allows a creature within range to quickly perform a simple task (other than attacking or casting a spell) as a bonus action on its turn. Examples include finding an item in a backpack, drinking a potion, and pulling a rope. Other actions may also fall into this category, depending on the GM's ruling. The target also ignores the loading property of weapons.
