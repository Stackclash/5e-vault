# Black Ribbons
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of ribbon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You pull pieces of the plane of shadow into your own reality, causing a 20-foot cube to fill with inky ribbons that turn the area into difficult terrain and wrap around nearby creatures. Any creature that ends its turn in the area becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the ribbons until the end of its next turn, unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] again by the ribbons, but it's still affected by the difficult terrain.
