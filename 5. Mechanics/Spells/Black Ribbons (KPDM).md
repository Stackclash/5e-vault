# Black Ribbons
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of ribbon
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You pull pieces of the plane of shadow into your own reality, causing a 20-foot cube to fill with inky ribbons that turn the area into difficult terrain and wrap around nearby creatures. Any creature that ends its turn in the area becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the ribbons until the end of its next turn, unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] again by the ribbons, but it's still affected by the difficult terrain.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]; [[List Spells Classes Rogue Arcane Trickster\|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[List Spells Classes Fighter Eldritch Knight\|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]
