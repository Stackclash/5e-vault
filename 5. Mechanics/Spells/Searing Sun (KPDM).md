# Searing Sun
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 200 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying lens)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell intensifies the light and heat of the sun, so that it burns exposed flesh. You must be able to see the sun when you cast the spell. The searing sunlight affects a cylindrical area 50 feet in radius and 200 feet high, centered on the a point within range. Each creature that starts its turn in that area takes `dice:5d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d8`) fire damage, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that's shaded by a solid object—such as an awning, a building, or an overhanging boulder—has advantage on the saving throw. On your turn, you can use an action to move the center of the cylinder up to 20 feet along the ground in any direction.
