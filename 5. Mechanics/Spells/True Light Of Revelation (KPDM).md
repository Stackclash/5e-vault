# True Light of Revelation
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a small piece of phosphorous
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A golden radiance spreads out from you, providing bright light up to 30 feet away, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Any creatures or objects in the area of bright light that are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] become visible while they are within 30 feet of you. Likewise, any magical disguises or illusions within 30 feet of you become feeble and transparent, their illusory nature obvious. These magical effects return to full potency if they move more than 30 feet away from you, or vice versa.

When a creature that has taken a different form—through spells such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Polymorph.md\|polymorph]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shapechange.md\|shapechange]], or from inborn abilities, such as a druid's [wild shape](compendium/classes/druid.md#Wild%20Shape%20(Level%202)) feature—enters the bright light, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be forced to return to its original form. Likewise, a creature attempting to change shape within the bright light must succeed on a Constitution saving throw in order to do so.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]
