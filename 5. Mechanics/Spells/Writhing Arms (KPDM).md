# Writhing Arms
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your arms become constantly writhing tentacles. You can use your action to make a melee spell attack against any target within range. The target takes `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) necrotic damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] (escape DC is your spell save DC). If the target does not escape your grapple, you can use your action on each subsequent turn to deal `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) necrotic damage to the target automatically.

Although you control the tentacles, they make it difficult to manipulate items. You cannot wield weapons or hold objects, including material components, while under the effects of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage you deal with your tentacle attack increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each slot level above 1st.
