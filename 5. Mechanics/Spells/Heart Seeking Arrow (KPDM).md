# Heart-Seeking Arrow
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition—or the weapon itself, if it's a thrown weapon—seeks its target's vital organs. Make the attack roll as normal. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) damage of the same type dealt by the weapon, or half as much damage on a miss, as it streaks unerringly toward its target. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target has disadvantage on its next death saving throw, and, if it dies, it can be restored to life only by means of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/True Resurrection.md\|true resurrection]] or a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]] spell. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the extra damage on a hit increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Hunting Domain)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-hunting-domain-kpdm.md "subclass=KPDM"); [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5.
