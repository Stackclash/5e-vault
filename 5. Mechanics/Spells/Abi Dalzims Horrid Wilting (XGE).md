# Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
*8th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of sponge)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes `dice:12d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`12d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
