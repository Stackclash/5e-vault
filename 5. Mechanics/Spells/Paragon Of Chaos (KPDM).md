*8th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You become a humanoid-shaped swirling mass of color and sound. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. You are also immune to the following conditions: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]]. Finally, you gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Truesight\|truesight]] to 30 feet and can teleport 30 feet as a move.

Each round, as a bonus action, you can cause an automatic [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Chaos Magic Surge (KPDM).md\|chaos magic surge]], choosing either yourself or another creature you can see within 60 feet as the caster for the purpose of resolving the effect. You must choose the target before rolling percentile dice to determine the nature of the surge. The DC of any required saving throw is calculated as if you were the caster.
