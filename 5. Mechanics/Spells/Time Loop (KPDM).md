# Time Loop
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a metal loop
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You capture a creature within range in a loop of time. The target is teleported to the space where it began its most recent turn. The target then makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature must repeat the activities it undertook on its previous turn, following the sequence of moves and actions to the best of its ability. It doesn't need to move along the same path or attack the same target, but if it moved and then attacked on its previous turn, its only option is to move and then attack on this turn. If the space where the target began its previous turn is occupied or if it's impossible for the target to take the same action (if it cast a spell but is now unable to do so, for example), the target becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]].

An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. For as long as the spell lasts, the target teleports back to its starting point at the start of each of its turns, and it must repeat the same sequence of moves and actions.
