# Frozen Razors
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, water from a melted icicle
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Razor-sharp blades of ice erupt from the ground or other surface, filling a 20-foot cube centered on a point you can see within range. For the duration, the area is lightly obscured and is difficult terrain. A creature that moves more than 5 feet into or inside the area on a turn takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) slashing damage and `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) cold damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

A creature that takes cold damage from frozen razors is reduced to half speed until the start of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the slashing or cold damage (your choice) increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) for each slot level above 3rd.
