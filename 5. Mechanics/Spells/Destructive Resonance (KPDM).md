# Destructive Resonance
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You shout a scathing string of Void Speech that assaults the minds of those before you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone that can hear you takes `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage, or half that damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. A creature damaged by this spell can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each slot level above 2nd.
