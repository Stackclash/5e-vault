# Shadow Metamorphosis
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature of Huge size or smaller, or a single object no more than 20 feet in any dimension, and transform it into malleable shadow-stuff. Objects under the effect of the spell are not immaterial, but are easy to shape or compress. One could not walk through a door that is affected by the spell, but the door could be pulled aside like a curtain and bypassed, or pulled up like the bottom edge of a tent flap and crawled under, even if the door was locked.

An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success. A creature under the effect of the spell is amorphous and can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In dim light or darkness, the creature has advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks. A creature under the effect of this spell cannot make attacks or cast spells and has vulnerability to radiant damage.
