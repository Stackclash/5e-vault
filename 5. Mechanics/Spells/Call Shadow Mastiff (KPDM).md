# Call Shadow Mastiff
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a dog's tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Monstrosity/Shadow Mastiff (KPDM).md\|shadow mastiff]] from the plane of shadow. This creature obeys your verbal commands to aid you in battle or to seek out a specific creature. It has the body of a large dog with a smooth black coat, 2 feet high at the shoulder and weighing 200 pounds.

The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the mastiff; it acts on its own turn. It obeys simple, verbal commands from you, within its ability to act. Giving a command takes no action on your part.

The mastiff disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
