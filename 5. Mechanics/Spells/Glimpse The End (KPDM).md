# Glimpse the End
*3rd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, a pinch of grave dust or a piece from a tombstone
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You examine the life force in a creature you touch and sense when it will expire. You and the creature share a vision of the most likely way in which the creature will die. You both sense approximately how far into the future the event occurs. The vision is not a prophecy or a definite fate; life can take unexpected twists and turns. It is, however, the most likely outcome at the current time unless the creature alters the course of its life. The vision can seem to last as little as a few moments or as long as 30 minutes to you and the spell's target, but in the objective world, the knowledge is received instantaneously.
