# Calm of the Storm
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an amethyst worth 250 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

While visualizing the world as you wish it was, you lay your hands upon a creature other than yourself and undo the effect of a chaos magic surge that affected the creature within the last minute. Reality reshapes itself as if the surge never happened, but only for that creature.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the time since the chaos magic surge can be 1 minute longer for each slot level above 3rd.
