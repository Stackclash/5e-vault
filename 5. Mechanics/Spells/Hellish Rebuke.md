# Hellish Rebuke
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each slot level above 1st.
