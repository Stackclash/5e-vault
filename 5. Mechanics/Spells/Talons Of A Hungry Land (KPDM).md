# Talons of a Hungry Land
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You cause three parallel lines of thick, flared obsidian spikes to erupt from the ground. They appear within range on a solid surface, last for the duration, and provide three-quarters cover to creatures behind them. You can make lines (up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick) or form a circle (20 feet in diameter, up to 15 feet high and 5 feet thick).

When the lines appear, each creature in their area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures takes `dice:8d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d8`) slashing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the lines at the risk of cutting itself on the exposed edges. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the lines, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the lines on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes `dice:8d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d8`) slashing damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

When you stop concentrating on the spell, you can cause the obsidian spikes to explode, dealing `dice:5d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d8`) slashing damage to any creature within 15 feet, or half as much damage on a successful Dexterity save.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage from all effects of the lines increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each slot level above 7th.
