- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a crow's eye)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You amplify the fear that lurks in the heart of all creatures. Select a target point you can see within the spell's range. Every creature within 20 feet of that point becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] until the start of your next turn and must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]]. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] are not affected by this spell.
