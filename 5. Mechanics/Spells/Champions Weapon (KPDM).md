# Champion's Weapon
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

A spectral version of a melee weapon of your choice materializes in your hand. It has standard statistics for a weapon of its kind, but it deals force damage instead of its normal damage type and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. You have proficiency with this weapon for the spell's duration. The weapon can be wielded only by the caster; the spell ends if the weapon is held by a creature other than you or if you start your turn more than 10 feet from the weapon.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` force damage for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]
