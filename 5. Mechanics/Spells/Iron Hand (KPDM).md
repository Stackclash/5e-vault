# Iron Hand
*cantrip, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell is common among metalsmiths and other crafters who work with heat. When you use this spell, one of your arms becomes immune to fire damage, allowing you to grasp red-hot metal, scoop up molten glass with your fingers, or reach deep into a roaring fire to pick up an object. In addition, if you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dodge\|Dodge]] action while you're protected by iron hand, you have resistance to fire damage until the start of your next turn.
