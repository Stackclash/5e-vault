# Misfortune
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a broken mirror)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cast a pall of bad luck over all creatures in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed with bad luck for the duration of the spell. A creature under the effect of this spell has disadvantage on all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell ends this effect.

**SPECIAL:** If a targeted creature is carrying a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Stone Of Good Luck.md\|stone of good luck]], the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the item ceases to function for 24 hours. Likewise, if a targeted creature is carrying a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Luck Blade.md\|luck blade]], the creature is unaffected by the spell, but the sword's Luck ability and saving throw bonuses cease to function for 24 hours.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
