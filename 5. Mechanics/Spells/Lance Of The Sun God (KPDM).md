# Lance of the Sun God
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You invoke a lance made of force and light. The lance glows brightly, providing light as a lantern. You are considered proficient with this weapon, and it has the same weapon properties as a nonmagical [[5. Mechanics/Items/Lance.md\|lance]]. On a successful melee attack with the lance, you deal `dice:1d12|noform|noparens|avg` (`d12`) force damage and `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) radiant damage.

You can perform a charge attack with the lance. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and hit with the lance on the same turn, you double the damage of the attack.
