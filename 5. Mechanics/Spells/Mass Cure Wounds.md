# Mass Cure Wounds
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to `dice: 3d8|avg` (`3d8`) + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
