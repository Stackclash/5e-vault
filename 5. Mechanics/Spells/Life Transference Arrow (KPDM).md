# Life Transference Arrow
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a glowing arrow of necrotic magic and command it to strike a creature you can see within range. The arrow can have one of two effects; you choose which at the moment of casting. If you make a successful ranged spell attack, you and the target experience the desired effect. If the attack misses, the spell fails.

- The arrow deals `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage to the target, and you heal the same amount of hit points.  
- You take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage, and the target heals the same amount of hit points.  

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell's damage and hit points healed increase by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 1st.
