# Enhance Familiar
*2nd-level, Transmutation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You temporarily imbue your familiar with power, making it larger, tougher, and more vicious. While the spell lasts, your familiar has all the statistics of the giant version of its type, except for the fish (quipper), which has the statistics of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Reef Shark.md\|reef shark]]. Your familiar retains all its special abilities as described in the find familiar spell.

If your familiar drops to 0 hit points and disappears, or you dismiss your familiar, the spell ends, and your familiar is returned to its normal form when you next summon it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, its duration is 1 hour and does not require concentration. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases to 24 hours.
