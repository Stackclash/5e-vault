- **Range:** 30 feet

You temporarily imbue your familiar with power, making it larger, tougher, and more vicious. While the spell lasts, your familiar has all the statistics of the giant version of its type, except for the fish (quipper), which has the statistics of a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Reef Shark.md\|reef shark]]. Your familiar retains all its special abilities as described in the find familiar spell.

If your familiar drops to 0 hit points and disappears, or you dismiss your familiar, the spell ends, and your familiar is returned to its normal form when you next summon it.
