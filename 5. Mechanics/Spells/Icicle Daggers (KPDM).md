# Icicle Daggers
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature dagger shaped like an icicle
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, Special

When you cast this spell, three icicles appear in your hand. Each icicle has the same properties as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dagger.md\|dagger]] but deals an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) cold damage on a hit.

The icicle daggers melt a few seconds after leaving your hand, making it impossible for other creatures to wield them. If the surrounding temperature is at or below freezing, the daggers last for 1 hour. They melt instantly if you take 10 or more fire damage.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can create two additional daggers for each slot level above 1st. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, daggers that leave your hand don't melt until the start of your next turn.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]; [[List Spells Classes Rogue Arcane Trickster\|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[List Spells Classes Fighter Eldritch Knight\|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric Winter Domain (KPDM)\|Cleric (Winter Domain)]]
