# Phantasmal Killer
*4th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Druid (Circle of Roses)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-roses-kpdm.md "subclass=KPDM"); [[5.
