# Shadowy Retribution
*4th-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minutes unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver cup filled with the caster's blood)
- **Duration:** 12 hours

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

You fill a small silver cup with your own blood (taking `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) piercing damage) while chanting vile curses in the dark. Once the chant is completed, you consume the blood and swear an oath of vengeance against any who harm you.

If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your oath is invoked; a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Shadow.md\|shadow]] materializes within 5 feet of you. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Shadow.md\|shadow]] attacks the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points, ignoring all other targets, until it or the target is slain, at which point the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Shadow.md\|shadow]] dissipates into nothing.

## Group Spellcasting

When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, an additional creature is conjured for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum of 6 shadows materializing when you are reduced to 0 hit points.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, the spell summons a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Banshee.md\|banshee]] instead of a creaturew. If you use group spellcasting, the additional undead are still [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Shadow.md\|shadows]].
