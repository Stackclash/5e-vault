*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action

- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.  
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.  
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.  
- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
