Ghostly spirits emerge from your body and whirl around you. Your body emits dim light in a 15-foot radius for the spell's duration. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You have immunity to necrotic damage and resistance to poison damage.

- You can use an action to direct the ghostly spirits to assail a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) necrotic damage and gain one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]].
