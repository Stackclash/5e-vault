# Snow Boulder
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of snow)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 4 rounds

A ball of snow forms 5 feet away from you and rolls in the direction you point at a speed of 30 feet, growing larger as it moves. To roll the boulder into a creature, you must make a successful ranged spell attack. If the boulder hits, the creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and take the damage indicated below. Hitting a creature doesn't stop the snow boulder's movement or impede its growth, as long as you continue to maintain concentration on the effect. When the spell ends, the boulder stops moving.
