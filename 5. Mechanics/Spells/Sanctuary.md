# Sanctuary
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]].

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.
