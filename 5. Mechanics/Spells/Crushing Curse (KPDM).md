# Crushing Curse
*cantrip, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of Void Speech. Choose a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) psychic damage and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] for 1 minute, except that it can still hear Void Speech. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

This spell's damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`)), 11th level (`dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`)).
