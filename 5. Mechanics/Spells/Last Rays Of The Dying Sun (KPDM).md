# Last Rays of the Dying Sun
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A burst of searing heat explodes from you, dealing `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) fire damage to all enemies within range. Immediately afterward, a wave of frigid cold rolls across the same area, dealing `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) cold damage to enemies. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, the damage from both waves increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 7th.
