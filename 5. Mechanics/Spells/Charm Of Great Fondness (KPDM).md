# Charm of Great Fondness
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or if you are not the same species as the target. If the saving throw fails, the targeted humanoid becomes quite fond of you until the duration expires or until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature regards you as a potential romantic partner and seeks to attract you in whatever manner is most appropriate to it. It might tell you jokes or clown around, give you a (modest) gift, flirt gently, flex its muscles and demonstrate its athletic prowess, or compose a love poem to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. If two or more creatures fail their saving throws, they fall to bickering between themselves over who is more worthy of your affection.
