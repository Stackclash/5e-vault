# Thunderous Stampede
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action

This spell acts as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Thunderous Charge (KPDM).md\|thunderous charge]], but affecting up to three targets within range, including yourself. A target other than you must use its reaction to move and attack under the effect of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the distance your targets can move increases by 10 feet, and the attack deals an additional `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` thunder damage, for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Arcane Trickster.md\|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[5.
