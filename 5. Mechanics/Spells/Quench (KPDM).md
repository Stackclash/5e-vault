# Quench
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a cloth soaked in water
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You extinguish all nonmagical fires in a 30-foot-radius area centered on the point at which you cast the spell. You can extinguish fire spells in the area as well. For each fire spell in the area, make a spellcasting ability check. The DC equals 10 + the fire spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

Fire elementals in the area take `dice:8d6|noform|avg` (`8d6`) cold damage. A successful Constitution saving throw reduces the damage by half.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the area increases by 10 feet, and the damage against fire elementals increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)`, for each slot level above 3rd.
