# Thousand Darts
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (120-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S, a set of mithral darts worth 25 gp

You launch thousands of needlelike darts in a 5-foot-wide line that is 120 feet long. Each creature in the line takes `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) piercing damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. The first creature struck by the darts makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 3rd.
