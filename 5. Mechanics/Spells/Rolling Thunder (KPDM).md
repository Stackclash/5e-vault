# Rolling Thunder
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S, a sliver of metal from a gong
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A tremendous bell note explodes from your outstretched hand and rolls forward in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] for 1 minute. A creature made of material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on its saving throw against this spell.

While a creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] in this way, it is wreathed in thundering energy; it takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) thunder damage at the start of its turn, and its speed is halved. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]; [[List Spells Classes Rogue Arcane Trickster\|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[List Spells Classes Fighter Eldritch Knight\|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]
