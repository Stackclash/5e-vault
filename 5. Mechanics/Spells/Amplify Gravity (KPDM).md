# Amplify Gravity
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of lead)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell intensifies gravity in a 50-foot-radius area within range. Inside the area, damage from falling is quadrupled (`dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) per 5 feet fallen) and maximum damage from falling is `dice:40d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`40d6`). Any creature on the ground in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Strength saving throw or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]; the same applies to a creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] creature in the area must make a successful Strength saving throw to stand up. A creature on the ground in the area moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and ranged attack rolls.
