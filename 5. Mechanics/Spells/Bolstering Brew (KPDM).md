Calling upon the patron deity of brewers, you bring forth a vibrant brew of beer or ale. Up to six other creatures within range can partake of this drink with you and share in its magical benefits, each drawing a mug from the small keg of magical brew that appears. A creature that downs a mug of magical beer gains advantage on either all Strength checks or all Charisma checks (chosen when it drinks), is immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and makes all Constitution saving throws with advantage. These benefits last for 8 hours.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric Beer Domain (KPDM)\|Cleric (Beer Domain)]]
