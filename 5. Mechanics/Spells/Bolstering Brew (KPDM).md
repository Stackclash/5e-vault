- **Range:** 30 feet

Calling upon the patron deity of brewers, you bring forth a vibrant brew of beer or ale. Up to six other creatures within range can partake of this drink with you and share in its magical benefits, each drawing a mug from the small keg of magical brew that appears. A creature that downs a mug of magical beer gains advantage on either all Strength checks or all Charisma checks (chosen when it drinks), is immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and makes all Constitution saving throws with advantage. These benefits last for 8 hours.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Beer Domain)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-beer-domain-kpdm.md "subclass=KPDM"); [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Cleric.md\|Cleric]]
