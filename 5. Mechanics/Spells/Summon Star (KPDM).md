# Summon Star
*8th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon a friendly star from the heavens to do your bidding. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range and takes the form of a glowing humanoid with long white hair. All creatures other than you who view the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] for the duration of the spell. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] and is immune to the effect of this casting of the spell. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Celestial/Deva.md\|deva]]. It understands and obeys verbal commands you give it (no action required from you). If you do not give the star a command, it defends itself and attacks the last creature that attacked it. The star disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
