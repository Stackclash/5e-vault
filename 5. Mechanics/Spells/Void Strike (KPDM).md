# Void Strike
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

With a short phrase of Void Speech, you gather writhing darkness around your hand. When you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns while you maintain concentration, you can unleash a bolt of darkness at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. If the target is in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on the roll. On a hit, the target takes `dice:5d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d8`) necrotic damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast the spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each slot level above 3rd.
