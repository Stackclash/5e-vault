# Lair Sense
*2nd-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, treasure worth at least 500 gp
- **Duration:** 24 hour

You set up a magical boundary around your lair. The boundary can't exceed the dimensions of a 100-foot cube, but within that maximum, you can shape it as you likeâ€”to follow the walls of a building or cave, for example.

While the spell lasts, you instantly become aware of any Tiny or larger creature that enters the enclosed area. You know the creature's type but nothing else about it. You are also aware when creatures leave the area.

This awareness is enough to wake you from sleep, and you receive the knowledge as long as you're on the same plane of existence as your lair.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, add 50 feet to the maximum dimensions of the cube and add 12 hours to the spell's duration for each slot level above 2nd.
