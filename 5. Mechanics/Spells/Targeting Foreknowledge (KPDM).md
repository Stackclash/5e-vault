# Targeting Foreknowledge
*3rd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Twisting the knife, slapping with the butt of the spear, slashing out again as you recover from a lunge, and countless other double-strike maneuvers are skillful ways to get more from your weapon. By casting this spell as a bonus action upon making a successful melee weapon attack, you deal an extra `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) damage of the weapon's type to the target. In addition, if your original weapon weapon attack roll was a 19 or higher, treat this extra attack as achieving a critical hit, doubling the damage die.
