# Necrotic Leech
*5th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel destructive energy through your touch. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. The target takes `dice:8d10|noform|avg` (`8d10`) necrotic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell slot you expended. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell's damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(1d10)` for each slot level above 5th.
