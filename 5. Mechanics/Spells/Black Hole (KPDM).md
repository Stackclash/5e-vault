# Black Hole
*9th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a tiny black hole at a point you can see within range. The black hole is a sphere with a 15-foot radius. All fires and flames within 40 feet of the black hole—magical or otherwise—are instantly extinguished. Each creature within 40 feet of the black hole when it appears must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:20d6|noform|avg` (`20d6`) force damage and is pulled to within 5 feet of the black hole. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] but isn't pulled toward the black hole.

A creature that's within 5 feet of the black hole at the start of its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or take `dice:8d6|noform|avg` (`8d6`) force damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. A creature that's within 40 feet of the black hole (but not within 5 feet of it) at the end of its turn takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while within 5 feet of the black hole dies immediately.
