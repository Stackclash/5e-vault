# Fog of War
*4th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cloud the minds of your opponents, hindering their perception of the battlefield and veiling reality with twisted illusions. You can affect up to six creatures within range. While the spell is in effect, targeted creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks made to locate enemies.

If a targeted creature makes an attack against a creature that has at least one other creature adjacent to it—friend or foe—the targeted creature must roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On an 11 or higher, its attack is applied to the adjacent creature instead (roll randomly to determine the new target if there is more than one adjacent creature) and deals damage as normal if it hits. At the start of their turn, a targeted creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is unhindered by the spell for that round.
