# Ale-dritch Blast
*cantrip, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A stream of ice-cold ale blasts from your outstretched hands toward a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold damage and it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of its next turn. A targeted creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it has drunk any alcohol within the last hour.

The damage increases when you reach higher levels: `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) at 5th level, `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) at 11th level, and `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) at 17th level.
