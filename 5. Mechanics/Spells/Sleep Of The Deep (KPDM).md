# Sleep of the Deep
*3rd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a pinch of black sand, a tallow candle, and a drop of cephalopod ink
- **Duration:** 8 hour

Your magic haunts the dreams of others. Choose a sleeping creature that you are aware of within range. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be targeted. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it garners no benefit from the rest, and when it awakens, it gains one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] and is afflicted with short-term madness.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]
