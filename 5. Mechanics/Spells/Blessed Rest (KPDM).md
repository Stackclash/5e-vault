# Blessed Rest
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You place a benediction upon a creature, ensuring it a healthy rest. If the target takes a short rest, it can reroll any Hit Die spent for regaining hit points and take the higher roll.

If the target takes a long rest, it regains up to two extra Hit Dice when resting, up to its maximum Hit Dice. For example, if the target has eight Hit Dice, it can regain six spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

Once the target has taken one rest (long or short), the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for every two slot levels above 2nd.
