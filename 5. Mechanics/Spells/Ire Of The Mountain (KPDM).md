# Ire of the Mountain
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of coal)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell melts nonmagical objects that are made primarily of metal. Choose one metal object weighing 10 pounds or less that you can see within range. Tendrils of blistering air writhe toward the target. A creature holding or wearing the item must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) fire damage and the spell has no further effect. On a failed save, the targeted object melts and is destroyed, and the creature takes `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) fire damage if it is wearing the object, or `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) fire damage if it is holding the object. If the object is not being held or worn by a creature, it is automatically melted and rendered useless. This spell cannot affect magic items.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional object for each slot level above 3rd.
