*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Special

You attempt to afflict a humanoid you can see within range with memories of distant, alien realms and their peculiar inhabitants. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with a form of long-term madness and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) hours or until you or one of your allies harms it in any way. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, the creature regards you as a sacred monarch. If you or an ally of yours is fighting the creature, it has advantage on its saving throw.

A successful [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell ends both effects.
