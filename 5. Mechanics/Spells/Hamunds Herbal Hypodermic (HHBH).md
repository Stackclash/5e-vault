# Hamund's Herbal Hypodermic
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minute

When you cast this spell, you grow a hollow needle from your arm for the duration that can be used as a natural finesse weapon to make unarmed strikes that deal `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) + Dexterity modifier in damage.

Strikes with this needle can also be used to quickly deliver a poison or herb that would normally take much longer to apply to a weapon. As a bonus action, you may use the needle to absorb a poison or herb that would normally be used to coat a weapon. If you do so, this needle acts as if it is coated in that poison or herb, with all the benefits that would entail.
