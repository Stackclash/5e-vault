# Curse of the Grave
*7th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt from a freshly dug grave)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You tap your connection to death to curse a humanoid, making the grim pull of the grave stronger on that creature's soul.

Choose one humanoid you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic ends this curse. While cursed in this way, the target suffers the following effects:

- The target fails death saving throws on any roll but a 20.  
- If the target dies while cursed, it rises 1 round later as a vampire spawn under your control and is no longer cursed.  
- The target, as a vampire spawn, seeks you out in an attempt to serve its new master. You can have only one vampire spawn under your control at a time through this spell. If you create another, the existing one turns to dust. If you or your companions do anything harmful to the target, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it is no longer under your control.
