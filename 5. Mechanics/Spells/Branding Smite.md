# Branding Smite
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] until the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]; [[List Spells Classes Artificer Battle Smith (TCE)\|Artificer (Battle Smith)]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric Chain Domain (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG4)\|Cleric (Chain Domain)]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock The Hexblade (XGE)\|Warlock (The Hexblade)]]
