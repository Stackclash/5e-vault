# Doom of Disenchantment
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 round

When you cast this spell, your worn armor and clothing glow with light. When a creature hits you with an attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a [[5. Mechanics/Items/1 Weapon.md\|+1 weapon]] would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.

The spell also suppresses other magical properties of the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can't cause ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost to the weapon's damage normally. If the attack was a spell, it's affected as if you had cast counterspell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.
