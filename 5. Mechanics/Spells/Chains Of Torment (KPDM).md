# Chains of Torment
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, an iron chain link dipped in blood
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You are surrounded by an aura of dim light in a 10-foot radius as you conjure an iron chain that extends out to a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] in this way, the creature is also [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]]. A creature that's [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] at the start of its turn takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage. You can have only one creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] in this way at a time.

As an action, you can scan the mind of the creature that's [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by your chain. If the creature gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, you learn one discrete piece of information of your choosing known by the creature (such as a name, a password, or an important number). The effect is otherwise harmless.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
