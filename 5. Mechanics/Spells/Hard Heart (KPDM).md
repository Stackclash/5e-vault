# Hard Heart
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, an iron key
- **Duration:** 10 minute

You imbue your touch with the power to make a creature aloof, hardhearted, and unfeeling. The creature you touch as part of casting this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw unless it's currently [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]]. On a successful save, this spell fails. On a failed save, the target becomes immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] for the duration; if it's currently [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], that effect ends. In addition, Charisma checks against the target are made with disadvantage for the spell's duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, the duration increases to 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.
