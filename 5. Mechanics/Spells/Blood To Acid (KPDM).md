# Blood to Acid
*9th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, you designate a creature within range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:10d12|noform|avg` (`10d12`) acid damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] by the pain for `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]].

Creatures without blood, such as constructs and plants, are not affected by this spell. If blood to acid is cast on a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a blood elemental or a blood zombie, the creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.
