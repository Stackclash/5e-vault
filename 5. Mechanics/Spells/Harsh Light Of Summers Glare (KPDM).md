# Harsh Light of Summer's Glare
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

You emit a burst of brilliant light, which bears down oppressively upon all creatures within range that can see you. Creatures with [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] that fail a Constitution saving throw are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]]. Creatures without [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] that fail a Constitution saving throw are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]]. This is not a gaze attack, and it cannot be avoided by averting one's eyes or wearing a blindfold.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Druid.md\|Druid]]
