# Life from Death
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your hand can siphon energy from the undead to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against an undead creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) radiant damage, and you or an ally within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the amount of radiant damage dealt. If used on an ally, this effect can restore the ally to no more than half of its hit point maximum. This effect can't heal an undead or a construct. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 3rd.
