# Curse of Hostility
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed with the antipathy of a certain type of creature, chosen by you when you cast the spell. Choose from one of the following: aberrations, beasts, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, humanoids, monstrosities, plants, or undead. In situations involving creatures of the selected type, the following effects apply.

- In encounters with creatures of the selected type when the creatures are already hostile, they will attack the target of this spell in preference to other targets.  
- A creature of the selected type gains advantage on any attack rolls made against the target if the target has attacked and hit that creature at least once during the encounter.  
- The target has disadvantage on any Charisma-based checks made against creatures of the chosen type.  

A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md\|remove curse]] spell ends this effect.
