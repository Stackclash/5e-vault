A supernatural olfactory sense allows you to smell wounded living creatures. Until the spell ends, you can pinpoint a creature that doesn't have all of its hit points within 30 feet of you, and you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) and Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks to track a creature that doesn't have all of its hit points. In addition, you have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all of its hit points. The spell has no effect on creatures that don't have blood.
