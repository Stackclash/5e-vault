# Iron Stomach
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You subtly alter the digestive system of the creature you touch, allowing it to safely eat and extract nutrition from any organic matter it eats. As long as the creature eats at least 1 pound of organic matter per day, it does not suffer from hunger. If it eats organic matter that is poisonous, or that has been [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] with an organic substance (serpent venom, for example), it has advantage on the saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
