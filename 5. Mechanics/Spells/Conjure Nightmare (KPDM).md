# Conjure Nightmare
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (brimstone and a torch)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Nightmare.md\|nightmare]] to serve you. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you choose within range. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Nightmare.md\|nightmare]] will serve you as a mount, in combat and out. The [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Nightmare.md\|nightmare]] is friendly to you and your companions for the duration, and follows any commands you issue to it. If your concentration is broken, the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Nightmare.md\|nightmare]] is no longer bound by the spell. It might leave immediately, especially if it has been wounded or threatened, but it is just as likely to attack you or an ally, or otherwise gain retribution for being summoned and bound to your service. If you provide the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Nightmare.md\|nightmare]] with a sacrifice it can devour when it is first summoned, it will be appeased enough to simply return home once the spell ends, without causing harm to you or your companions.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 5th.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Warlock.md\|Warlock]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
