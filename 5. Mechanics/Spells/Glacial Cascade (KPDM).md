# Glacial Cascade
*8th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of alexandrite)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

By harnessing the power of ice and frost, you emanate pure cold, filling a 30-foot-radius sphere. Creatures other than you in the sphere take `dice:10d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d8`) cold damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature killed by this spell is transformed into ice, leaving behind no trace of its original body.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
