# Proselytize
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol or religious tome, text, or pamphlet)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You imbue your words with darkness and fear, bringing creatures around you to their knees. Every creature within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] and can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the effect increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.
