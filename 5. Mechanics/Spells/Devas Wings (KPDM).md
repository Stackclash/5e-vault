# Deva's Wings
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a wing feather from any bird
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You touch a willing creature. The target grows feathery wings of pure white that grant it a flying speed of 60 feet and the ability to hover. When the target takes the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Attack\|Attack]] action, it can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the wings, with a reach of 10 feet. If the wing attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. When the spell ends, the wings disappear, and the target falls if it was aloft.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional target for each slot level above 4th.
