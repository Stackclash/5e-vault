# Green-Flame Blade
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (5-foot Radius)
- **Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) at 11th level (`dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) and `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`)) and 17th level (`dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) and `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`)).
