# Boulder Toss
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You draw the power of the mountains into you, gaining a surge of strength that allows you to take an action to hurl a rock (or similar object) as a giant does. Your Strength is considered to be 19 for the purpose of determining damage from objects that you hurl.

Your hurled rock has a range of 60/240 feet and deals `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC or be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, your Strength is considered to be 21, and the bludgeoning damage increases to `dice:3d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d10`). If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, your Strength is considered to be 23, and the bludgeoning damage increases to `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`).
