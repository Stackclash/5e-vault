# Speak with Inanimate Object
*1st-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minute

You awaken a spirit that resides inside an inanimate object such as a rock, a sign, or a table, and can ask it up to three yes-or-no questions. The spirit is indifferent toward you unless you have done something to harm or help it. The spirit can give you information about its environment and about things it has observed (with its limited senses), and it can act as a spy for you in certain situations. The spell ends when its duration expires or after you have received answers to three questions.
