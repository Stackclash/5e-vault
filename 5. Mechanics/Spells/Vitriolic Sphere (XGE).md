# Vitriolic Sphere
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:10d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d4`) acid damage and another `dice:5d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d4`) acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d4)` for each slot level above 4th.
