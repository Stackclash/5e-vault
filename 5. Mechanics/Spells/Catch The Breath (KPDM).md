# Catch the Breath
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this spell as a reaction when you're targeted by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you advantage on your saving throw against the breath weapon. If your saving throw succeeds, you take no damage from the attack even if a successful save normally only halves the damage.

Whether your saving throw succeeded or failed, you absorb and store energy from the attack. On your next turn as a bonus action, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) force damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage done by your attack increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(1d10)` for each slot level above 3rd.
