# Frenzied Bolt
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Making a ranged spell attack, you direct a bolt of rainbow colors toward a creature of your choice within range. If the bolt hits, the target takes `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) damage, of a type determined by rolling on the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Random Damage Type (KPDM).md\|Random Damage Type]] table. If the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) result of your attack roll (the "natural" roll) was odd, the bolt leaps to a new target of your choice within range that has not already been targeted by this casting of the spell, requiring a new spell attack roll to hit. The bolt continues leaping to new targets until you roll an even number on your spell attack roll, miss a target, or run out of potential targets. You and your allies are legal targets for this spell, if you are particularly luckyâ€”or unlucky.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create an additional bolt for each slot level above 2nd. Each potential target can be hit only once by each casting of the spell, not once per bolt.
