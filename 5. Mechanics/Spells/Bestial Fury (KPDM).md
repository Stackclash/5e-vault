# Bestial Fury
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You instill primal fury into a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failure, the target must use its action to attack its nearest enemy it can see with unarmed strikes or natural weapons. For the duration, the target's attacks deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage of the same type dealt by its weapon, and the target can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]]. If there are no enemies within reach, the target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Ranger\|Ranger]]
