# Soothing Incandescence
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A soft, white radiance spreads out from a point just above your head, creating bright light in a 30-foot radius around your present location. If you move from your present location, the area of light remains fixed. A creature in the area other than a fiend or an undead regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns while within the bright light. Each fiend or undead in the area takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) radiant damage at the start of each of its turns.
