# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]]. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]] target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Bard.md\|Bard]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md\|Warlock]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|Wizard]]
