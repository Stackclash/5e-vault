# Instant Snare
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a loop of twine
- **Duration:** 24 hour

You create a snare on a point you can see within range. You can leave the snare as a magical trap, or you can use your reaction to trigger the trap when a Large or smaller creature you can see moves within 10 feet of the snare. If you leave the snare as a trap, a creature must succeed on an Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check against your spell save DC to find the trap.

When a Large or smaller creature moves within 5 feet of the snare, the trap triggers. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled into the air. The creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] and hangs upside down 5 feet above the snare's location for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, escaping the snare on a success. Alternatively, a creature, including the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] target, can use its action to make an Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature is freed, and the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds on the check by 5 or more, the snare is destroyed instead.

This spell alerts you with a ping in your mind when the trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional snare for each slot level above 2nd. When you receive the mental ping that a trap was triggered, you know which snare was triggered if you have more than one.
