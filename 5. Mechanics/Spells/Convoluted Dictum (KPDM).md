# Convoluted Dictum
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a long, twisted piece of red ribbon
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You manipulate the thinking of a creature within range, compelling it to take longer, more elaborate means to complete actions. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take only one action or bonus action on its turn until the spell ends.

If the target tries to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't do so, the spell is wasted. If the target interacts with an object while taking its action, such as drawing a sword as part of an attack, it must also roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On an 11 or higher, it must make the interaction with the object its sole action on that round, taking the Use An Object action. In the example given, the target would take its action drawing the sword with an extensive amount of flourish or drama and be unable to attack with it until its next turn.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.
