# Cruor of Visions
*5th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a bone needle and a catch basin
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 minute

You prick your finger with a bone needle as you cast this spell, taking 1 necrotic damage. This drop of blood must be caught in a container, such as a platter or a bowl, where it grows into a pool 1 foot in diameter. This pool acts as a crystal ball for the purposes of [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scrying.md\|scrying]].

If you place a drop (or dried flakes) of another creature's blood in the container, the creature has disadvantage on any Wisdom saving throw to resist scrying. Additionally, you can treat the pool of blood as a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball Of Telepathy.md\|crystal ball of telepathy]].

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the pool of blood acts as either a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball Of Mind Reading.md\|crystal ball of mind reading]] or a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball Of True Seeing.md\|crystal ball of true seeing]] (your choice when the spell is cast).

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer Divine Soul (XGE)\|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]
