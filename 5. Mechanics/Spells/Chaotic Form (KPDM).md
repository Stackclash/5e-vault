# Chaotic Form
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minute

You cause the form of a willing creature to become malleable, dripping and flowing according to the target's will as if the creature were a vaguely humanoid-shaped ooze. The creature is not affected by difficult terrain, it has advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) checks made to escape a grapple, and it suffers no penalties when squeezing through spaces one size smaller than itself. The target's movement is halved while it is affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 10 minutes for each slot level above 4th.
