# Boiling Oil
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of oil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a shallow, 15-foot-radius pool of boiling oil centered on a point within range. The pool is difficult terrain, and any creature that enters the pool or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) fire damage and falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each slot level above 2nd.
