# Synaptic Static
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes `dice: 8d6|avg` (`8d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a `dice: d6|avg` (`d6`) and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#concentration|concentration]]. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Bard.md|Bard]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Sorcerer.md|Sorcerer]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md|Warlock]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md|Wizard]]
