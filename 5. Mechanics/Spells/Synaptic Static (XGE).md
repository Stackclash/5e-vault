# Synaptic Static
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes `dice:8d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a `dice:d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]]. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
