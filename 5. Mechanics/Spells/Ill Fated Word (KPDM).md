# Ill-fated Word
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You call out a distracting epithet to a creature, worsening its chance to succeed at whatever it's doing. Roll a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that the target has just made; the target uses the lowered result to determine the outcome of its roll.
