# Gordolay's Pleasant Aroma
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a few flower petals or a piece of fruit, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an intoxicating aroma that fills the area within 30 feet of a point you can see within range. Creatures in this area smell something they find so pleasing that it's distracting. Each creature in the area that makes an attack roll must first make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, the attack is made with disadvantage. Only a creature's first attack in a round is affected this way; subsequent attacks are resolved normally. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to the effect of this particular scent, but they can be affected again by a new casting of the spell.
