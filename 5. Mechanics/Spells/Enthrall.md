# Enthrall
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] or can no longer speak.
