# Wild Trajectory
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 30-foot cube of magical instability that causes spell effects passing through it to diverge wildly from their original paths. When a spell with a visible or tangible manifestation (such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lightning Bolt.md\|lightning bolt]], or a ray or projectile such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md\|magic missile]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ray Of Frost.md\|ray of frost]]) passes through the area, roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`). On a 1, the spell continues on its original path or toward its original target; on a 2, it diverts 45 degrees to the right; on a 3, it diverts 90 degrees to the right; on a 4, it diverts 135 degrees to the right; on a 5, it turns 180 degrees, back the way it came (striking the caster if it is a targeted spell); on a 6, the spell diverts 45 degrees to the left; on a 7, it diverts 90 degrees to the left; on an 8, it diverts 135 degrees to the left.

A spell that affects anything in its path, such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lightning Bolt.md\|lightning bolt]], will continue to do so along its new trajectory up to the limit of its range. A spell such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] will travel in the new direction up to the limit of its range before detonating. A targeted spell will strike the first viable target it encounters along its new trajectory.
