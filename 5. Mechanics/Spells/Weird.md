*9th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes [[\5. Mechanics\Rules\Conditions.md#frightened|frightened]] for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the [[\5. Mechanics\Rules\Conditions.md#frightened|frightened]] creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 4d10` (`4d10`) psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
