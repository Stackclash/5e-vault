# Steel Wind Strike
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes `dice:6d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d10`) force damage.

You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.
