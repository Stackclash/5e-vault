# Confound Senses
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a broken compass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

This spell befuddles the minds of up to six creatures that you can see within range, causing the creatures to see images of shifting terrain. Each target that fails an Intelligence saving throw is reduced to half speed until the spell ends because of confusion over its surroundings, and it makes ranged attack rolls with disadvantage. Affected creatures also find it impossible to keep track of their location. They automatically fail Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks to avoid getting lost. Whenever an affected creature must choose between one or more paths, it chooses at random and immediately forgets which direction it came from.
