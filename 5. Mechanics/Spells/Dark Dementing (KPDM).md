# Dark Dementing
*5th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a moon stone)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A dark shadow creeps across the target's mind and leaves a small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for the duration. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack into a space that isn't brightly lit. If it's in dim light or darkness, the creature must either move toward bright light or create its own (by lighting a lantern, casting a light spell, or the like).
