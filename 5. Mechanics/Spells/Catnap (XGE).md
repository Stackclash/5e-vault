# Catnap
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a pinch of sand)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.
