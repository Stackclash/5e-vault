# Flesh to Paper
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A willing creature you touch becomes as thin as a sheet of paper until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is also flattened. The target can't cast spells or attack, and attack rolls against it are made with disadvantage. It has advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks while next to a wall or similar flat surface. The target can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If it occupies the same space as an object or a creature when the spell ends, the creature is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it was moved.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
