# Earworm Melody
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You sing or play a catchy tune that only one creature of your choice within range can hear. Unless the creature makes a successful Wisdom saving throw, the verse becomes ingrained in its head. If the target is concentrating on a spell, it must make a Constitution check with disadvantage against your spell save DC in order to maintain concentration.

For the spell's duration, the target takes `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns as the melody plays over and over in its mind. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the target must also repeat the Constitution check with disadvantage if it is concentrating on a spell.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d4|noform|avg|text(1d4)` for each slot level above 1st.
