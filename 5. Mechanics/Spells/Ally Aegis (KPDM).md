# Ally Aegis
*6th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

When you see an ally within range in imminent danger, you can use your reaction to protect that creature with a shield of magical force. Until the start of your next turn, your ally has a +5 bonus to AC and is immune to force damage. In addition, if your ally must make a saving throw against an enemy's spell that deals damage, the ally takes half as much damage on a failed saving throw and no damage on a successful save. *Ally aegis* offers no protection, however, against psychic damage from any source.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional ally for each slot level above 6th.
