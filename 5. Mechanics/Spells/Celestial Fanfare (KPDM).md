# Celestial Fanfare
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature trumpet worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A great blaring of trumpets from on high blasts down upon an area you designate. All evil creatures in a 30-foot radius take `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) thunder damage and `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) radiant damage and are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] for `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) rounds. A successful Constitution saving throw reduces the damage and the duration of the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] conditions by half.

Neutral or unaligned creatures within the area take half as much damage and are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]] for half as many rounds. A successful save reduces the damage to one-quarter and negates the blinding and deafening effects.

Good-aligned creatures are not harmed by this spell.
