# Glacial Fog
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (crystalline statue of a polar bear worth at least 25 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As you cast this spell, a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range becomes covered in a frigid fog. Each creature that is in the area at the start of its turn while the spell remains in effect must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:12d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`12d6`) cold damage and gains one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]], and it has disadvantage on [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]] checks until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and ignores the other effects.

Stored devices and tools are all frozen by the fog: crossbow mechanisms become sluggish, weapons are stuck in scabbards, potions turn to ice, bag cords freeze together, and so forth. Such items require the application of heat for 1 round or longer in order to become useful again.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each slot level above 7th.
