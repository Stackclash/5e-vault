# Alter Time Flow
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You control the currents of time, affecting all creatures within 30 feet of yourself. You can choose to deliver either a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Haste.md\|haste]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Slow.md\|slow]] effect (as the spell) to each creature in the area. An unwilling creature makes a Constitution saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success. Each unwilling creature must make a new saving throw if it remains in the affected area at the end of its turn. Any affected creature returns to normal if it exits the area, but if a creature reenters the area while the spell is still active, it is subject to the effect of the spell (and receives another saving throw, if unwilling).

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Cleric.md\|Cleric]]; [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE")
