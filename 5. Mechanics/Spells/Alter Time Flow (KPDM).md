# Alter Time Flow
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V, S, an hourglass
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You control the currents of time, affecting all creatures within 30 feet of yourself. You can choose to deliver either a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Haste.md\|haste]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Slow.md\|slow]] effect (as the spell) to each creature in the area. An unwilling creature makes a Constitution saving throw, avoiding the effect on a success. Each unwilling creature must make a new saving throw if it remains in the affected area at the end of its turn. Any affected creature returns to normal if it exits the area, but if a creature reenters the area while the spell is still active, it is subject to the effect of the spell (and receives another saving throw, if unwilling).

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer Divine Soul (XGE)\|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]
