# Mass Hobble Mount
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

When you cast this spell, you make separate ranged spell attacks against up to six horses, wolves, or other four-legged or two-legged beasts being ridden as mounts within 60 feet of you. The targets can be different types of beasts and can have different numbers of legs.

Each beast hit by your spell is disabled so that it can't move at its normal speed without incurring injury. An affected creature that moves more than half its base speed in a turn takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage.
