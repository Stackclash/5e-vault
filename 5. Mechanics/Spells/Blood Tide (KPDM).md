# Blood Tide
*cantrip, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 25 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 4 round

When you cast this spell, a creature you designate within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bleed from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. This bleeding deals no damage but imposes aâ€“2 penalty on the creature's Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom checks. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

A bleeding creature might attract the attention of creatures such as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Stirge.md\|stirges]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Reef Shark.md\|sharks]], or giant mosquitoes, depending on the circumstances. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Cure Wounds.md\|cure wounds]] spell stops the bleeding early, as does a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Medicine\|Medicine]]) check.

The spell's duration increases to 2 minutes when you reach 5th level, to 10 minutes when you reach 11th level, and to 1 hour when you reach 17th level.
