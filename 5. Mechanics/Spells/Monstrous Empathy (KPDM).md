*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)

This spell lets you forge a connection with a monstrosity. Choose a monstrosity that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the monstrosity's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the monstrosity must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect one additional monstrosity for each slot level above 3rd.
