# Wresting Wind
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of paper confetti)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

By blowing a pinch of confetti from your cupped hand, you create a burst of air that can rip weapons and other items out of the hands of your enemies. Each enemy in a 20-foot radius centered on a point you target within range must make a successful Strength saving throw or drop anything held in its hands. The objects land 10 feet away from the creatures that dropped them, in random directions.
