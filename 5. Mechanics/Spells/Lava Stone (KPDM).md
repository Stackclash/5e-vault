# Lava Stone
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, a sling stone
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell on a piece of sling ammo, the stone or bullet becomes intensely hot. As a bonus action, you can launch the heated stone with a sling: the stone increases in size and melts into a glob of lava while in flight. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If it hits, the target takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) fire damage. The target takes additional fire damage at the start of each of your next three turns, starting with `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`), then `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`), and then `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`). The additional damage can be avoided if the target or an ally within 5 feet of the target scrapes off the lava. This is done by using an action to make a successful Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Medicine\|Medicine]]) check against your spellcasting save DC. The spell ends if the heated sling stone isn't used immediately.
