# Conjure Mock Animals
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You summon fey spirits that take the outward appearance of animals, but merely to serve as a distraction and trap for the unwary. The spell functions as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Animals.md\|conjure animals]], but each mock animal has only 1 hit point and deals only 1 damage on a hit regardless of its appearance.

When a mock animal is dropped to 0 hit points, it explodes in a flash of light, dealing `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) radiant damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. Each creature that takes damage must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] for 1 round. Exploding mock animals do not deal this damage to other mock animals.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Druid.md\|Druid]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Ranger.md\|Ranger]]
