# Magma Spray
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur or a piece of brimstone)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot-diameter, 5-foot-tall cylindrical fountain of magma erupts from the ground in a space of your choice within range. A creature in that space takes `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature that enters the area on its turn or ends its turn there also takes `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

A creature whose hit points are reduced to 0 by this damage is killed immediately, and its body burns to ash.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each slot level above 2nd.
