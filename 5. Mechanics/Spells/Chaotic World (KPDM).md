# Chaotic World
*6th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, seven irregular pieces of colored cloth that you throw into the air
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You throw a handful of colored cloth into the air while screaming a litany of disjointed phrases. A moment later, a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range fills with multicolored light, cacophonous sound, overpowering scents, and other confusing sensory information. The effect is dizzying and overwhelming. Each enemy within the cube must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]], and fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. An affected enemy cannot stand up or recover from the blindness or deafness while within the area, but all three conditions end immediately for a creature that leaves the spell's area.
