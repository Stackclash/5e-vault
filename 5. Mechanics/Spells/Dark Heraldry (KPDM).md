# Dark Heraldry
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Dark entities herald your entry into combat, instilling an existential dread in your enemies. Designate a number of creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one) that you can see within range and that have an alignment different from yours. Each of those creatures takes `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) psychic damage and becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you; a creature that makes a successful Wisdom saving throw takes half as much damage and is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]].

A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The creature makes this saving throw with disadvantage if you can see it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Druid\|Druid]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]
