# Indecision
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be overcome with indecision. On a failed save, the target takes its entire turn to perform its next action due to the creature's hesitation. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it takes no action that round. If the creature has moved before taking an action, its action does not occur until the start of its next turn. Each round, the creature can attempt another saving throw at the start of its turn. On a successful save, the spell ends.

This spell has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or lower.
