# Catapult
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 400 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small platinum lever and fulcrum worth 400 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You magically hurl an object or creature weighing 500 pounds or less 40 feet through the air in a direction of your choosing (including straight up). Objects hurled at specific targets require a spell attack roll to hit. A thrown creature takes `dice:6d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d10`) bludgeoning damage from the force of the throw, plus any appropriate falling damage, and lands [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. If the target of the spell is thrown against another creature, the total damage is divided evenly between them and both creatures are knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`), the distance thrown increases by 10 feet, and the weight thrown increases by 100 pounds for each slot level above 6th.
