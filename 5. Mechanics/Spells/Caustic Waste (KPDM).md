# Caustic Waste
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of poison, acid, or other caustic substance)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create either a rectangular pool of acid 50 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, or a circular pool of acid 20 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep, in an open space you can see within range. Each creature in the spell's area when the spell is cast takes `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) acid damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature that enters the area on its turn or ends its turn in the area takes `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) acid damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each slot level above 4th.
