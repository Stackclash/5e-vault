# Symbol of Sorcery
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a stick of incense worth 20 gp
- **Duration:** 8 hour

You draw an arcane symbol on an object, wall, or other surface at least 5 feet wide. When a creature other than you approaches within 5 feet of the symbol, that act triggers an arcane explosion. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]]. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. After this symbol explodes or when the duration expires, its power is spent and the spell ends.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
