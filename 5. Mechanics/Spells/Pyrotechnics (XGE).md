# Pyrotechnics
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an area of nonmagical flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

## Fireworks

The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the end of your next turn.

## Smoke

Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.
