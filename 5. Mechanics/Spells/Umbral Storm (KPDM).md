# Umbral Storm
*9th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a channel to a region of the Plane of Shadow that is inimical to life and order. A storm of dark, raging entropy fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn in the storm or enters it for the first time on its turn takes `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) necrotic damage and gains one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]].

You can use a bonus action on your turn to move the area of the storm 30 feet in any direction.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
