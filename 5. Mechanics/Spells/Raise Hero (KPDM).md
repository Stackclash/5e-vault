# Raise Hero
*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

This spell is identical to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Dead.md\|raise dead]] in every way except duration; the creature is restored to life for only 24 hours. The spell can be recast on the same creature, but on the second and subsequent castings, the caster must roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). If the roll equals or is less than the number of prior castings on the same creature, the spell fails and cannot affect that creature again. Each new casting resets the clock to 24 hours; it doesn't stack another 24 hours onto a previous casting.
