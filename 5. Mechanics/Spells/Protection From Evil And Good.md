# Protection from Evil and Good
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed|charmed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened|frightened]], or possessed by them. If the target is already [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed|charmed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#frightened|frightened]], or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
