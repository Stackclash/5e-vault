# Demon Within
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of blood from a humanoid killed within the previous 24 hours)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One humanoid of your choice within range becomes a gateway for a demon to enter the plane of existence you are on. You choose the demon's type from among those of challenge rating of 4 or lower. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the gateway fails to open, and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) force damage from the demon's attempt to claw its way through the gate. For the spell's duration, you can use a bonus action to further agitate the demon, dealing an additional `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) force damage to the target each time.

If the target drops to 0 hit points while affected by this spell, the demon tears through the body and appears in the same space as its now [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] or dead victim. You do not control this demon; it is free to either attack or leave the area as it chooses. The demon disappears after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points.
