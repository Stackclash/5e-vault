# Knock
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Chest.md\|chest]], a set of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Manacles.md\|manacles]], a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Arcane Lock.md\|arcane lock]], that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Bard.md\|Bard]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Fighter Eldritch Knight.md\|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Rogue Arcane Trickster.md\|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|Wizard]]
