# Tongue Tied
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You make a choking motion while pointing at a target, which must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become unable to communicate verbally. The target's speech becomes garbled, and it has disadvantage on Charisma checks that require speech. The creature can cast a spell that has a verbal component only by making a successful Constitution check against your spell save DC.

On a failed check, the creature's action is used but the spell slot isn't expended.
