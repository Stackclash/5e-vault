# Conjure Spectral Dead
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of bone dust, a crystal prism, and a silver coin)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon a shroud (Tome of Beasts, p. 348) to do your bidding. The creature appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The creature is friendly to you and your allies for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot, you can choose to summon two shrouds or one [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Specter.md\|specter]]. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can choose to summon four shrouds or one [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Will O Wisp.md\|will-o'-wisp]].
