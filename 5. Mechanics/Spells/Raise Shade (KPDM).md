This spell is identical to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Ghost (KPDM).md\|raise ghost]] in every way, except the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it's not sufficient to wield one in combat, or to draw a bow.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]
