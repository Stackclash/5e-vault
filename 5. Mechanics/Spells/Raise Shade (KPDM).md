# Raise Shade
*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell is identical to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Ghost (KPDM).md\|raise ghost]] in every way, except the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it's not sufficient to wield one in combat, or to draw a bow.
