# Booster Shot
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You imbue a two-handed ranged weapon (typically a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Shortbow.md\|shortbow]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Longbow.md\|longbow]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Light Crossbow.md\|light crossbow]], or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Heavy Crossbow.md\|heavy crossbow]]) that you touch with a random magical benefit. While the spell lasts, a projectile fired from the weapon has an effect that occurs on a hit in addition to its normal damage. Roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) to determine the additional effect for each casting of this spell.
