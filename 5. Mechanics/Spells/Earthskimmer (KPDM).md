# Earthskimmer
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of shale or slate)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause earth and stone to rise up beneath your feet, lifting you up to 5 feet. For the duration, you can use your movement to cause the slab to skim along the ground or other solid, horizontal surface at a speed of 60 feet. This movement ignores difficult terrain. If you are pushed or moved against your will by any means other than teleporting, the slab moves with you.

Until the end of your turn, you can enter the space of a creature up to one size larger than yourself when you take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Dash\|Dash]] action. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. It takes `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]] on a succesful one.
