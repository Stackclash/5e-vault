# Detonate Corpses
*5th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded bone or a fossil worth at least 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause up to five Small or Medium corpses that you can see within range to explode in a hail of bone shards. Each creature within 20 feet of a detonated corpse takes `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) piercing damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each slot level above 5th.
