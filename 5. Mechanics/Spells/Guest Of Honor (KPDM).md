# Guest of Honor
*1st-level, Enchantment (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minutes unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, M (a signet ring worth 25 gp)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

You whisper words of encouragement, and a creature that you touch gains confidence along with approval from strangers. For the spell's duration, the target puts its best foot forward and strangers associate the creature with positive feelings. The target adds `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) to all Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) checks made to influence the attitudes of others.

## Group Spellcasting

When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, the spell lasts for an additional 10 minutes for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum duration of 90 minutes.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, the effect lasts for 24 hours.
