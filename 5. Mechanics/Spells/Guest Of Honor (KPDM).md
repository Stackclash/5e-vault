You whisper words of encouragement, and a creature that you touch gains confidence along with approval from strangers. For the spell's duration, the target puts its best foot forward and strangers associate the creature with positive feelings. The target adds `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) to all Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) checks made to influence the attitudes of others.
