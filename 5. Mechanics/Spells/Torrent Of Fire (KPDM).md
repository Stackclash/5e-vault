# Torrent of Fire
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of obsidian
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You harness the power of fire contained in ley lines with this spell. You create a 60-foot cone of flame. Creatures in the cone take `dice:6d6|noform|avg` (`6d6`) fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. You can then flow along the flames, reappearing anywhere inside the cone's area. This repositioning doesn't count as movement and doesn't trigger [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attacks]].
