# Consult the Storm
*4th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You ask a question of an entity connected to storms, such as an elemental, a deity, or a primal spirit, and the entity replies with destructive fury.

As part of the casting of the spell, you must speak a question consisting of fifteen words or fewer. Choose a point within range. A short, truthful answer to your question booms from that point. It can be heard clearly by any creature within 600 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of the point takes `dice:7d6|noform|avg` (`7d6`) thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 4th.
