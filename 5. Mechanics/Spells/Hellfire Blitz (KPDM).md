# Hellfire Blitz
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Upon casting this spell, you assume a flaming spectral form until the end of your turn. You immediately move up to 40 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, but you must end your turn in an unoccupied space. This movement doesn't provoke [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attacks]]. Each creature whose space you pass through takes `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.

You leave a 5-foot-wide line of hellfire burning behind you in your path. This hellfire continues burning for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. A creature that ends its turn in hellfire or passes through the line on its turn takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each slot level above 3rd.
