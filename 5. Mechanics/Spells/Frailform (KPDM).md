# Frailform
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mummified heart encased in amber, worth at least 1,500 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast a creature within range with a beam of pure, entropic energy that ages it rapidly. The target takes `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) necrotic damage and must make a successful Constitution saving throw; on a failure, its Strength and Dexterity are both reduced to 1. While its Strength and Dexterity are reduced in this way, the creature can't hold weapons weighing more than 3 pounds, its speed is halved, and it can't take reactions. The creature's Armor Class and attack rolls are modified to account for its reduced attributes. The creature can cast spells normally.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw after it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Wish.md\|wish]], or comparable magic.
