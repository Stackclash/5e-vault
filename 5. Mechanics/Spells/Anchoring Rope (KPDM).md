# Anchoring Rope
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 5 minutes

You create a spectral lanyard. One end is tied around your waist, and the other end is magically anchored in the air at a point you select within range. You can choose to make the rope from 5 to 30 feet long, and it can support up to 800 pounds. The point where the end of the rope is anchored in midair can't be moved after the spell is cast. If this spell is cast as a reaction while you are falling, you stop at a point of your choosing in midair and take no falling damage. You can dismiss the rope as a bonus action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional rope for every two slot levels above 1st. Each rope must be attached to a different creature.
