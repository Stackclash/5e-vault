# Chains of Perdition
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a few links of iron chain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Lengths of iron chain appear near a creature you choose within range, possibly ensnaring the target and causing it physical and mental suffering. The targeted creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the chains and take `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage and `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) psychic damage. The creature takes this damage on your turn every round that it remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the chains. On its turn, a [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature can make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

The chains remain until the spell ends. If they are not restraining a creature, you can use a bonus action to direct the chains to target the same creature or another one, moving the chains up to 20 feet (within the range of the spell) if necessary to do so. If the chains move beyond the maximum range, the spell ends. The chains can be destroyed; treat them as an object with AC 18, 15 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to poison damage and psychic damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` bludgeoning damage and `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` psychic damage for every two slot levels above 3rd.
