# Icy Grasp of the Void
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon the cold, inky darkness of the Void into being around a creature that you can see. The target takes `dice:10d10|noform|avg` (`10d10`) cold damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] for the duration; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] condition. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature gains one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]] at the start of each of its turns. Creatures immune to cold and that do not breathe do not gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
