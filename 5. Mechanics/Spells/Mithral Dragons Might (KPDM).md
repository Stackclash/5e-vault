# Mithral Dragon's Might
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You take on some of the physical characteristics and abilities of a mithral dragon, growing protective scales, wings, and claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can't be lower than 16, regardless of what armor you are wearing, and you have resistance to to acid and thunder damage. You can spend an action on your turn to attack twice with your claws, each dealing `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) slashing damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier on a hit. Finally, the wings grant you a flying speed of 40 feet.

Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of metal shards, dealing `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) slashing damage to all creatures in the cone. A creature that succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon.
