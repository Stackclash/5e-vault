# Spin
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You designate a creature you can see within range and tell it to spin. The creature can resist this command with a successful Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature spins in place for the duration of the spell. A spinning creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that has spun for 1 round or longer becomes dizzy and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until 1 round after it stops spinning.
