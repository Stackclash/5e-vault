# Staggering Smite
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock The Hexblade (XGE)\|Warlock (The Hexblade)]]
