# Aura of Entropy
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Sickening energy radiates out from you in a sphere with a 30-foot radius. While the spell lasts, the sphere remains centered on you and moves with you. Each hostile creature in the sphere has disadvantage on saving throws against becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]]. Creatures in the sphere can't gain temporary hit points, and any effect that restores hit points to a creature within the sphere has those hit points reduced by an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1) .

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]
