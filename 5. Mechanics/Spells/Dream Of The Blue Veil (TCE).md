# Dream of the Blue Veil
*7th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magic item or a willing creature from the destination world)
- **Duration:** 6 hours

You and up to eight willing creatures within range fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for the spell's duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane, such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in the visions.

To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the world you wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world's existence, even if you don't know the world's name. Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that creature was born.

The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn't transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for you and all the other creatures, with none of you being transported.
