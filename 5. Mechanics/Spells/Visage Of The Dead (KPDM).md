# Visage of the Dead
*4th-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of bone or piece of skin from an animated skeleton or zombie)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You infuse yourself, and up to four creatures you touch, with necromantic energy, taking on aspects of the undead. The targets gain immunity to poison damage and the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] condition for the duration of the spell, and take on appearances similar to undead versions of themselves.

Undead that encounter a creature under the effect of this spell must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the undead mistakes the target for another undead creature. Typically this means the undead will ignore the target, especially if it is a less intelligent one such as a skeleton or a zombie, unless it is commanded otherwise. The response of more intelligent undead might depend on the conditions under which the encounter occurs, but if the target's presence would not be unusual, they too might likely ignore the target unless it acts suspiciously.
