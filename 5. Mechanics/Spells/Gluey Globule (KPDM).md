# Gluey Globule
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of glue)
- **Duration:** 1 minute, up to 1 hour

You make a ranged spell attack to hurl a large globule of sticky, magical glue at a creature within 120 feet. If the attack hits, the target creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]]. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature can break free by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. When the creature breaks free, it takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) slashing damage from the glue tearing its skin. If your ranged spell attack roll was a critical hit or exceeded the target's AC by 5 or more, the Strength saving throw is made with disadvantage. The target can also be freed by an application of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Universal Solvent.md\|universal solvent]] or by taking 20 acid damage. The glue dissolves when the creature breaks free or at the end of 1 minute.

Alternatively, this spell can also be used to glue an object to a solid surface or to another object. In this case, the spell works like a single application of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Sovereign Glue.md\|sovereign glue]] and lasts for 1 hour.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Arcane Trickster.md\|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Eldritch Knight.md\|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]
