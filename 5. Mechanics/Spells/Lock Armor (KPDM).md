# Lock Armor
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of rust and metal shavings)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You target a piece of metal equipment or a metal construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to negate the effect. On a failed save, the spell causes metal to cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected.

Metal constructs, as well as creatures wearing metal armor (according to DM discretion) are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]]. An affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Grease.md\|grease]] spell dispels *lock armor* on everything in its area.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
