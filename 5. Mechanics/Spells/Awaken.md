# Awaken
*5th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 8 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Awakened Shrub.md\|awakened shrub]] or the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Awakened Tree.md\|awakened tree]].

The awakened beast or plant is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]].

**Classes**: [Cleric (Ocean Domain)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-ocean-domain-kpdm.md "subclass=KPDM"); [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5.
