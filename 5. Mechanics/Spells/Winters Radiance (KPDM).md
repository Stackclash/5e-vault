# Winter's Radiance
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 400 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of polished glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, the piercing rays of a day's worth of sunlight reflecting off fresh snow blankets the area in a 30-foot cube centered at a point within range. A creature caught in the spell's area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on ranged attacks and Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks for the duration of the spell. In addition, an affected creature's vision is hampered such that foes it targets are treated as having three-quarters cover.
