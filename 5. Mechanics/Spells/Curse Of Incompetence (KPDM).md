# Curse of Incompetence
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

By making mocking gestures toward one creature within range that can see you, you leave the creature incapable of performing at its best. If the target fails on an Intelligence saving throw, roll a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) and refer to the following table to determine what the target does on its turn. An affected target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success or applying the result of another roll on the table on a failure.

**Curse of Incompetence**

`dice: [[Curse Of Incompetence (KPDM).md#^curse-of-incompetence]]`

| dice: d4 | Curse |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Target spends its turn shouting mocking words at caster and takes a -5 penalty to its initiative roll. |
| 2 | Target stands transfixed and blinking, takes no action. |
| 3 | Target flees or fights (50 percent chance of each). |
| 4 | Target charges directly at caster, enraged. |
