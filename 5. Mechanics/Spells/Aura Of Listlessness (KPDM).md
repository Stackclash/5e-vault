# Aura of Listlessness
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lump of clay or a piece of wet paper)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an aura of power around you that saps the will and determination from creatures, making them unable to act. Any creature within 20 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to take actions, reactions, or bonus actions on its turn, except for the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Disengage\|Disengage]] action. Affected creatures can move, but only to distance themselves from harmful conditions, such as attacks by other creatures or hazardous effects that damage or cause ill effects. A creature that moves out of the area can act normally in the following round. Any creature that remains in the area must make another successful saving throw on its turn or continue to be affected by the spell.
