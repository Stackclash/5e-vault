# Snow Fort
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a ring carved from chalk or white stone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell creates a simple "fort" from packed snow. The snow fort springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It encircles a 10-foot area with sloping walls 4 feet high. The fort provides half cover (+2 AC) against ranged and melee attacks coming from outside the fort. The walls have AC 12, 30 hit points per side, are immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and are vulnerable to fire damage. A damaged wall can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point-for-point basis, up to a maximum of 30 points.

The spell also creates a dozen snowballs that can be thrown (range 20/60) and that deal `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) cold damage on a hit.
