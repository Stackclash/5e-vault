# Costly Victory
*8th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You select up to ten enemies you can see that are within range. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature is cursed to burst into flame if it reduces one of your allies to 0 hit points before this spell's duration expires. The affected creature takes `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) fire damage and `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) radiant damage when it bursts into flame.

If the affected creature is wearing flammable material (or is made of flammable material, such as a plant creature), it catches on fire and continues burning; the creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the end of each of its turns until the creature or one of its allies within 5 feet of it uses an action to extinguish the fire.
