# Blinding Smite
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] until the spell ends.

A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]].

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Paladin.md\|Paladin]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
