# Shade
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a magical screen across your eyes. While the screen remains, you are immune to blindness caused by visible effects, such as color spray. The spell doesn't alleviate blindness that's already been inflicted on you. If you normally suffer penalties on attacks or ability checks while in sunlight, those penalties don't apply while you're under the effect of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 10 minutes for each slot level above 2nd.
