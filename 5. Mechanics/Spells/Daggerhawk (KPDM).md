# Daggerhawk
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a dagger
- **Duration:** 1 minute

When this spell is cast on a nonmagical dagger, a ghostly hawk appears around the weapon. The hawk and dagger fly into the air and make a melee attack against one creature you select within 60 feet, using your spell attack modifier and dealing piercing damage equal to `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) + your Intelligence modifier on a hit. On your subsequent turns, you can use an action to cause the daggerhawk to attack the same target. The daggerhawk has AC 14 and, although it's invulnerable to all damage, a successful attack against it that deals bludgeoning, force, or slashing damage sends the daggerhawk tumbling, so it can't attack again until after your next turn.
