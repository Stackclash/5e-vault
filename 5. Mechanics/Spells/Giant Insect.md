# Giant Insect
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Centipede.md\|giant centipede]], a spider becomes a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Spider.md\|giant spider]], a wasp becomes a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Wasp.md\|giant wasp]], and a scorpion becomes a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Scorpion.md\|giant scorpion]].

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Wasp.md\|giant wasp]].

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Druid.md\|Druid]]
