# Mephitic Croak
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a dead toad and a dram of arsenic worth 10 gp
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You release an intensely loud burp of acidic gas in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) acid damage plus `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature whose Dexterity saving throw fails must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, both acid and thunder damage increase by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 2nd.
