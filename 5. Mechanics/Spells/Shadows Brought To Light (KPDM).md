# Shadows Brought to Light
*2nd-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

If a creature you designate within range fails a Charisma saving throw, you cause the target's shadow to come to life and reveal one of the creature's most scandalous secrets: some fact that the target would not want widely known (GM's choice). When casting the spell, you choose whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target's voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The shadow speaks in the target's native language.

If the target does not have a scandalous secret or does not have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature's saving throw had succeeded.

If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a −2 penalty to Charisma checks involving anyone who was present when it was revealed. This penalty lasts until you finish a long rest.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, the target has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of taking the −2 penalty.
