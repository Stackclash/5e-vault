# Fire Dragon's Fury
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You take on some of the physical characteristics and abilities of a fire dragon, growing protective scales, wings, and claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can't be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing, and you become resistant to fire. You can spend an action on your turn to attack twice with your claws, each dealing `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) slashing damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier on a hit. The wings also grant you a flying speed of 40 feet.

Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of flames, dealing `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) fire damage to all creatures in the cone. A creature that succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon.
