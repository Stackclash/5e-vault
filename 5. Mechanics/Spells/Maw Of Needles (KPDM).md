# Maw of Needles
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

A spiny array of needle-like fangs protrudes from your gums, giving you a spiny bite. For the duration, you can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the bite. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or some of the spines in your mouth break off, sticking in the target. Until this spell ends, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) piercing damage from the spines.

If you hit a target that has your spines stuck in it, your attack deals extra damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and more spines don't break off in the target. Your spines can stick in only one target at a time. If your spines stick into another target, the spines on the previous target crumble to dust, ending the effect on that target.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of the spiny bite and the spines increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for every two slot levels above 1st.
