# Sculpt Snow
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell in an area filled with snow, you can create one Large object, two Medium objects, or four smaller objects from snow. With a casting time of 1 action, your sculptings bear only a crude resemblance to generic creatures or objects. If you increase the casting time to 1 minute, your creations take on a more realistic appearance and can even vaguely resemble specific creatures; the resemblance isn't strong enough to fool anyone, but the creature can be recognized. The sculptures are as durable as a typical snowman.

Sculptures created by this spell can be animated with [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Animate Objects.md\|animate objects]] or comparable magic. Animated sculptures gain the AC, hit points, and other attributes provided by that spell. When they attack, they deal normal damage plus a similar amount of cold damage; an animated Medium sculpture, for example, deals `dice:2d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6 + 1`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:2d6+1|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6 + 1`) cold damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can sculpt one additional Large object for each slot level above 2nd. Two Large objects can be replaced with one Huge object.
