# Clockwork Bodyguard
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon clockwork minions to fight for you. Choose one of the following options for what appears (refer to Tome of Beasts, p. 62-65, for statistics):

- One clockwork huntsman  
- Two clockwork hound  
- Four clockwork watchman  

The clockwork creatures are friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creatures, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue commands, the clockwork creatures defend themselves or you from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The clockwork creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, more creatures of your choice appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with an 8th-level slot.
