# Aspect of the Ape
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You alter the appearance of a creature you touch, giving it a more simian form. While this spell is in effect, the subject gains a climbing speed equal to its normal walking speed, and gains advantage on Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) checks made when jumping or climbing. When up in a tree's branches (or in a similar area, at the GM's discretion) the target can move up to its climbing speed as a bonus action, using brachiation to reach a nearby tree if the branches are close enough together. This bonus action can be taken only if the subject has at least two hands free, or one hand free if the subject is barefoot.
