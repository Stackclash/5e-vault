# Withering Smite
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your weapon radiates terrible energy that empowers the next strike you make with it. The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) necrotic damage.

If the target of that attack was a creature, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, its flesh rotting around the wound. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The rotting effect also ends if the affected creature receives magical healing.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the weapon's hit increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each slot level above 1st. Subsequent necrotic damage doesn't increase.
