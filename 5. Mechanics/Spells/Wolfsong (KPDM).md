# Wolfsong
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You emit a howl that can be heard clearly from 300 feet away outdoors. The howl can convey a message of up to nine words, which can be understood by all dogs and wolves in that area, as well as (if you choose) one specific creature of any kind that you name when casting the spell.

If you cast the spell indoors and above ground, the howl can be heard out to 200 feet from you. If you cast the spell underground, the howl can be heard from 100 feet away.

A creature that understands the message is not compelled to act in a particular way, though the nature of the message might suggest or even dictate a course of action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can name another specific recipient for each slot level above 2nd.
