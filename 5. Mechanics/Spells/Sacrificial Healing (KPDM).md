# Sacrificial Healing
*4th-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a silver knife
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You heal another creature's wounds by taking them upon yourself or transferring them to another willing creature in range. Roll `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`). The number rolled is the amount of damage healed by the target and the damage you take, as its wounds close and similar damage appears on your body (or the body of the other willing target of the spell).

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]; [[List Spells Classes Rogue Arcane Trickster\|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[List Spells Classes Fighter Eldritch Knight\|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]
