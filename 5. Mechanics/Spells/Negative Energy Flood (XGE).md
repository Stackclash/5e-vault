# Negative Energy Flood
*5th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, a broken bone and a square of black silk
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:5d12|noform|avg` (`5d12`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Zombie.md\|zombie]] at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Zombie.md\|zombie]] are in the Monster Manual.

If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll `dice:5d12|noform|avg` (`5d12`). The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.
