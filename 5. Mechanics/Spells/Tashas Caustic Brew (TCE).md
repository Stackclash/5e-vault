# Tasha's Caustic Brew
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of rotten food)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) acid damage at start of each of its turns.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d4)` for each slot level above 1st.
