# Spy My Shadow
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You bring your shadow to life as a tenebrous spy that can slip under doors, between shutters, and through the narrowest of cracks. You can stretch your shadow up to ten times your height and move it as you desire. It remains two-dimensional and cannot interact with physical objects.

You can spy through your shadow's eyes and ears as if they were your own, but magically enhanced senses do not work through this spell. You can utilize the Stealth skill normally if trying to keep your shadow's presence a secret: it gains advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks in dim lighting but disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks in brightly lit areas.
