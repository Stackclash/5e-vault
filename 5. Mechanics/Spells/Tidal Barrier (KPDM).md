# Tidal Barrier
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of driftwood)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling wave of seawater surrounds you, crashing and rolling in a 10-foot radius around your space. The area is difficult terrain, and a creature that starts its turn there or that enters it for the first time on a turn must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
