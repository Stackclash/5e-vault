# Comprehend Wild Shape
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (two or more matching carved totems)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

Give one of the carved totems to an ally while keeping the other yourself. For the duration of the spell, you and whoever holds the other totem can communicate while either of you is in a beast shape. This isn't a telepathic link; you simply understand each other's verbal communication, similar to the effect of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Speak With Animals.md\|speak with animals]] spell. This effect doesn't allow a druid in beast shape to cast spells.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the number of target creatures by two for each slot level above 2nd. Each creature must receive a matching carved totem.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Druid.md\|Druid]]
