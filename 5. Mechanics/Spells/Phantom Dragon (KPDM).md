# Phantom Dragon
*3rd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of dragon egg shell
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You tap your dragon magic to make an ally appear as a draconic beast. The target of the spell appears to be a dragon of size Large or smaller. When seeing this illusion, observers make a Wisdom saving throw to see through it. You can use an action to make the illusory dragon seem ferocious. Choose one creature within 30 feet of the illusory dragon to make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]]. The creature remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] until it uses an action to make a successful Wisdom saving throw or the spell's duration expires.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase the number of targets the illusion can affect by one for each slot level above 3rd.
