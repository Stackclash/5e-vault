# Inspiring Speech
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 hour

The verbal component of this spell is a 10-minute-long, rousing speech. At the end of the speech, all your allies within the affected area who heard the speech gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and advantage on saving throws for 1 hour against effects that cause the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition. Additionally, each recipient gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If you move farther than 1 mile from your allies or you die, this spell ends. A character can be affected by only one casting of this spell at a time; subsequent, overlapping castings have no additional effect and don't extend the spell's duration.
