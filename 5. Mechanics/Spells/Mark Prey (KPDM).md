# Mark Prey
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You choose a creature you can see within range as your prey. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) and Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks to find or track your prey. In addition, the target is outlined in light that only you can see. Any attack roll you make against your prey has advantage if you can see it, and your prey can't benefit from being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] against you. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to mark a new target as your prey.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.
