# Heart to Heart
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of your blood)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you and the creature you touch remain stable and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] if one of you is reduced to 0 hit points while the other has 1 or more hit points. If you touch a dying creature, it becomes stable but remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] while it has 0 hit points. If both of you are reduced to 0 hit points, you must both make death saving throws, as normal. If you or the target regain hit points, either of you can choose to split those hit points between the two of you if both of you are within 60 feet of each other.
