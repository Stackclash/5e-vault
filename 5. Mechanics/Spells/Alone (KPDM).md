# Alone
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature within range to believe its allies have been banished to a different realm. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it treats its allies as if they were [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] and silenced. The affected creature cannot target, perceive, or otherwise interact with its allies for the duration of the spell. If one of its allies hits it with a melee attack, the affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.
