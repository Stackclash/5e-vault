# Ring Strike
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, two metal rings
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You infuse two metal rings with magic, causing them to revolve in a slow orbit around your head or hand. For the duration, when you hit a target within 60 feet of you with an attack, you can launch one of the rings to strike the target as well. The target takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet directly away from you. The ring is destroyed when it strikes.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect up to two additional rings for each spell slot level above 1st.
