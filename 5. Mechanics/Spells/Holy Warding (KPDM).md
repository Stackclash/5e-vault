You make a protective gesture toward your allies. Choose three creatures that you can see within range. Until the end of your next turn, the allies you have chosen have resistance to nonmagical weapon attacks, including bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If a target moves farther than 30 feet from you, the effect ends for that creature.
