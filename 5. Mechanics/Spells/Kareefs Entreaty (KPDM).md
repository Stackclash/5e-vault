# Kareef's Entreaty
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Your kind words offer hope and support to a fallen comrade. Choose a willing creature you can see within range that is about to make a death saving throw. The creature gains advantage on the saving throw, and if the result of the saving throw is 18 or higher, the creature regains `dice:3d4|noform|avg` (`3d4`) hit points immediately.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the creature adds 1 to its death saving throw for every two slot levels above 1st and regains an additional `dice:1d4|noform|avg|text(1d4)` hit points for each slot level above 1st if its saving throw result is 18 or higher.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]
