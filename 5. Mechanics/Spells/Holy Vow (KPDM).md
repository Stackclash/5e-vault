# Holy Vow
*3rd-level, Abjuration (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of holy water, which is consumed)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You willingly take a vow to complete a task or carry out a service. This task or service cannot conflict with your alignment or your sacred oath. While you serve under the vow, for as long as the spell lasts, your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 10. Whenever you make an attack roll or a saving throw, roll a `dice:d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) and add the result to the attack roll or saving throw. These benefits apply only when you are involved in activities that directly relate to your avowed task, or to situations you encounter that interfere with your ability to carry out that task (such as random encounters while traveling).

If you willingly forsake your vow, the spell ends, and you take `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) psychic damage. At the GM's discretion, you might suffer other penalties and need to atone for your decision. See the "Breaking Your Oath" sidebar in the paladin class description for more details. Failing to complete the task does not incur any penalties as long as you remain true to your vow, nor are you penalized if some form of outside coercion, magical or otherwise, leads you to forsake your vow (being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], for instance, or if a villain threatens the lives of innocents if you do not break the vow).
