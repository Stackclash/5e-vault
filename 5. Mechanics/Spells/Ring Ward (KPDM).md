# Ring Ward
*7th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (an iron ring worth 200 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

The iron ring you use to cast the spell becomes a faintly shimmering circlet of energy that spins slowly around you at a radius of 15 feet. For the duration, you and your allies inside the protected area have advantage on saving throws against spells, and all affected creatures gain resistance to one type of damage of your choice.
