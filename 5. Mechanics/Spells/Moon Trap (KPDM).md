# Moon Trap
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered silver worth 250 gp)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

While casting this spell under the light of the moon, you inscribe a glyph that covers a 10-foot-square area on a flat, stationary surface such as a floor or a wall. Once the spell is complete, the glyph is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] in moonlight but glows with a faint white light in darkness.

Any creature that touches the glyph, except those you designate during the casting of the spell, must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be drawn into an inescapable maze until the sun rises.

The glyph lasts until the next sunrise, at which time it flares with bright light, and any creature trapped inside returns to the space it last occupied, unharmed. If that space has become occupied or dangerous, the creature appears in the nearest safe unoccupied space.
