- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, an emerald worth at least 100 gp
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you shout this word of power, creatures within 20 feet of a point you specify are compelled to kneel down facing you. A kneeling creature is treated as [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. Up to 55 hit points of creatures are affected, beginning with those that have the fewest hit points. A kneeling creature makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. The effect ends immediately on any creature that takes damage while kneeling.
