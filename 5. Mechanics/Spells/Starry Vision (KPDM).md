# Starry Vision
*7th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a sprinkle of gold dust worth 400 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell acts as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Compelling Fate (KPDM).md\|compelling fate]], except as noted above (*starry vision* can be cast as a reaction, has twice the range of *compelling fate*, and lasts up to 1 minute). At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the bonus to AC increases by 1 for each slot level above 7th.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Wizard.md\|Wizard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
