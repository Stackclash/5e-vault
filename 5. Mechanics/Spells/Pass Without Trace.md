# Pass without Trace
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
