# Thorn Cage
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Thick vines studded with sharp thorns spring from the ground around a target of your choice. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the thorny vines until the spell ends. A creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the vines can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. Doing so causes the creature to take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage from the thorns. On a successful check, it frees itself.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Druid\|Druid]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]
