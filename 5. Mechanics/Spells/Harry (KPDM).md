# Harry
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a bit of fur from a game animal
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You instill an irresistible sense of insecurity and terror in the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks to avoid your notice and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you while you are within its line of sight. While you are within 1 mile of the target, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks to track the target, and the target can't take a long rest, terrified that you are just around the corner. The target can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes, ending the spell on a success.

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours, and the target can repeat the saving throw once each hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours, and the target can repeat the saving throw every 8 hours.
