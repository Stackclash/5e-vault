- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch up to four individuals, bolstering their courage. The next time a creature affected by this spell must make a saving throw against a spell or effect that would cause the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition, it has advantage on the roll. Once a creature has received this benefit, the spell ends for that creature.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Paladin.md\|Paladin]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Cleric.md\|Cleric]]
