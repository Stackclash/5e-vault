*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch up to four individuals, bolstering their courage. The next time a creature affected by this spell must make a saving throw against a spell or effect that would cause the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition, it has advantage on the roll. Once a creature has received this benefit, the spell ends for that creature.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin\|Paladin]]
