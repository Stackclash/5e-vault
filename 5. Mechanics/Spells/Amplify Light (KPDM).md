# Amplify Light
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a nonmagical light source
- **Duration:** Special

You touch a nonmagical light source and increase its brightness. While the spell is in effect, the radius of the bright light around the source is doubled, and dim light extends for the same distance beyond that area. The light source's duration is halved, however, so that a torch affected by amplify light would burn out in half an hour, or a hooded lantern would burn through its fuel in 3 hours. Adding new fuel to a light source while it is under the effect of amplify light will end the spell and return it to its normal brightness.
