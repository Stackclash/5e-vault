# Salt Lash
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt worth 1 sp, which is consumed during the casting)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a long, thin blade of razor-sharp salt crystals. You can wield it as a longsword, using your spellcasting ability to modify your weapon attack rolls. The sword deals `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) slashing damage on a hit, and any creature struck by the blade must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] by searing pain until the start of your next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to the blade's secondary (stun) effect; plants and creatures composed mostly of water, such as [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Water Element(AL).md\|water elementals]], also take an additional `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage if they fail the saving throw.

The spell lasts until you stop concentrating on it, the duration expires, or you let go of the blade for any reason.
