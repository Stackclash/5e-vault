You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Concentration\|concentration]] on the spell for up to 24 hours.
