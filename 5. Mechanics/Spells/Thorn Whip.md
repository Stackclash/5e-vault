# Thorn Whip
*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the stem of a plant with thorns)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a long, vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command toward a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) piercing damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

This spell's damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`)), 11th level (`dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`)).
