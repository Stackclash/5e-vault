# Brimstone
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a hunk of sulfuric brimstone that materializes in the air, then falls to the ground at a point within range. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage.

The brimstone remains in the space where it fell while the spell persists. Each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the brimstone must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) fire damage. The brimstone can be destroyed; it has AC 8 and 12 hp. The brimstone explodes if it takes fire damage; the explosion ends the spell and deals `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 15 feet, or half as much damage to a creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, its fire damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each slot level above 1st.
