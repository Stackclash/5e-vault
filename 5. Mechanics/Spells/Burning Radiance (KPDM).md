# Burning Radiance
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A line of light 60 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction of your choice. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:10d8|noform|avg` (`10d8`) radiant damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A successful saving throw halves the damage and prevents a creature from catching fire.

The spell ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
