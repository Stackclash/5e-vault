# Exude Acid
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You cause your body to produce a caustic acid. You and anything you were holding or carrying when the spell is cast is immune to the acid. While the spell is active, you can make a melee attack roll against a target, dealing `dice:4d4|noform|avg` (`4d4`) acid damage on a hit. If you are grappling a creature, it takes the acid damage every round on your turn, as if you had made a successful attack. If you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by a creature, or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] or immobilized by physical means (ropes, chains, or similar restraints), the creature or the restraints takes the acid damage each round.
