# Foretell Distraction
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know exactly when your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) check, provided cover or concealment is available within 10 feet of you. It doesn't matter whether enemies can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at just the right moment. You can move up to 10 feet as part of casting the spell, provided you're able to move (not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] or reduced to a speed of less than 10 feet for any other reason). This move doesn't count as part of your normal movement. After the spell is cast, you must be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly obscured space, for example, or a space where you have total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately and you're not hidden.
