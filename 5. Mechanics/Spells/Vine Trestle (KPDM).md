# Vine Trestle
*2nd-level, Conjuration (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a 1-inch piece of green vine that is consumed in the casting
- **Duration:** 1 hour, Until dispelled

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates.

The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 Ã— your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5.

## Group Spellcasting

When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each spellcaster other than yourself, supporting up to a maximum of 810 pounds with a maximum damage threshold of 12.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled.
