# Aura of Wrath
*6th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You surround yourself with a psychic aura that drives creatures within 20 feet of you into a violent frenzy. A creature inside the aura or that enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with rage.

A creature overcome with rage must take its next action to attack the nearest possible targetâ€”if more than one target is available, choose randomly. The creature uses a melee weapon if it has one; otherwise, it attacks with any other offensive ability it possesses. If an affected creature leaves the aura, the aura's effect persists for 1 round afterward. A creature affected by the aura makes a new saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature makes a successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by the same aura.

If a creature affected by your aura hits you with an attack that targets you, the creature takes `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) psychic damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, creatures that leave the aura remain under the effect of the spell for 1 additional round for each slot level above 6th. Also, the damage an affected creature takes from striking you increases by `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d8)` for each slot level above 6th.
