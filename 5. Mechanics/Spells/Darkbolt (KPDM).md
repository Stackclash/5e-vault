# Darkbolt
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) cold damage. A target that was hit by one or more rays must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be unable to use reactions until the start of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.
