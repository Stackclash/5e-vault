# Moonlight Charm
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 4 week

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or threatening it. If the saving throw fails, the humanoid remains [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] until the spell's duration expires, until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it, or until a full moon rises in the sky. The [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Druid\|Druid]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]; [[List Spells Classes Warlock\|Warlock]]; [[List Spells Classes Wizard\|Wizard]]
