# Illuminate Spoor
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a firefly)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a set of tracks created by a single creature. That set of tracks and all other tracks made by the same creature give off a faint glow. You and up to three creatures you designate when you cast this spell can see the glow. A creature that can see the glow automatically succeeds on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks to track that creature. If the tracks are covered by obscuring objects such as leaves or mud, you and the creatures you designate have advantage on Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) checks to follow the tracks.

If the creature leaving the tracks changes its tracks, such as by adding or removing footwear, the glow stops where the tracks change. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to touch and illuminate a new set of tracks.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours.
