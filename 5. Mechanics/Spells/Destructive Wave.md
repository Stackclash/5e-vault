You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) thunder damage, as well as `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [[/5.
