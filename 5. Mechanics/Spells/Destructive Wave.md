# Destructive Wave
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice:5d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d6`) thunder damage, as well as `dice:5d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d6`) radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Tempest Domain.md\|Cleric (Tempest Domain)]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Paladin.md\|Paladin]]; [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]
