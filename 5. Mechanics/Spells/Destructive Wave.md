*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 5d6|avg` (`5d6`) thunder damage, as well as `dice: 5d6|avg` (`5d6`) radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]]. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]].

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Cleric Tempest Domain.md\|Cleric (Tempest Domain)]], [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Paladin.md\|Paladin]]
