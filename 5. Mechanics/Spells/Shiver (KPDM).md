# Shiver
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a humanoid tooth
- **Duration:** 1 round

You fill a humanoid creature with such cold that its teeth begin to chatter and its body shakes uncontrollably. Roll `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`); the total is the maximum hit points of a creature this spell can affect. The affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it cannot cast a spell or load a missile weapon until the end of your next turn. Once a creature has been affected by this spell, it is immune to further castings of this spell for 24 hours.

The maximum hit points you can affect increases by `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:9d8|noform|avg` (`9d8`)), 11th level (`dice:13d8|noform|avg` (`13d8`)), and 17th level (`dice:17d8|noform|avg` (`17d8`)).
