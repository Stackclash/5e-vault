# Chains of the Goddess
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, 1 foot of iron chain
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a creature you can see within 90 feet. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by chains of psychic force and take `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) bludgeoning damage. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. While [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] in this way, the creature also takes `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]
