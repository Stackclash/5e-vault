# Liar's Gift
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

This spell makes even the most barefaced untruth seem plausible: you gain advantage on Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]) checks to convince another creature of the truth of whatever you're saying. On a failed check, the creature knows that you tried to manipulate it with magic. If you successfully lie to a creature that has a friendly attitude toward you, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you can also coax the creature to reveal a potentially embarrassing secret. The verbal component of this spell is the lie you are telling.
