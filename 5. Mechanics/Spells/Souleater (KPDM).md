# Souleater
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You instill a hunger for the life force of others into a weapon you touch. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits dim light in a 30-foot radius. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

As a bonus action, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage and you heal half that many hit points. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and you do not heal.
