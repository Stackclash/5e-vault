# Wild Shield
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You surround yourself with the forces of chaos. Wild lights and strange sounds engulf you, making stealth impossible. While this spell is active, you can use a reaction to repel a spell of 4th level or lower that targets you or whose area you are within. A repelled spell has no effect on you, but doing this causes the chance of a [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Chaos Magic Surge (KPDM).md\|chaos magic surge]] as if you had cast a spell, with you considered the caster for any effect of the surge.

This spell ends when the duration expires or when it absorbs 4 levels of spells. If you try to repel a spell whose level exceeds the number of levels remaining, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's levelâ€“the number of levels this spell can still repel. If the check succeeds, the spell is repelled; if the check fails, the spell has its full effect. The chance of a [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Chaos Magic Surge (KPDM).md\|chaos magic surge]] exists regardless of whether the spell is repelled.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can repel one additional spell level for each slot level above 4th.
