# Circle of Death
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes `dice:8d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(2d6)` for each slot level above 6th.
