# Conjure Fey Hound
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a wooden or metal whistle
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon a fey hound to fight by your side. A hound of the night (Tome of Beasts, p. 251) appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned hound is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned hound, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the hound, it stands by your side and attacks nearby creatures that are hostile to you but otherwise takes no actions.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you summon two hounds. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you summon three hounds.
