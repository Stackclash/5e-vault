# Soul Borrowing
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a polished vampire's fang
- **Duration:** 1 minute

By touching a creature, you gain one sense, movement mode and speed, feat, language, immunity, or other nonmagical ability of the target for the duration of the spell. The target also retains the use of the borrowed ability. An unwilling target prevents the effect with a successful Constitution saving throw. The target can be a living creature or one that has been dead no longer than 1 minute; a corpse automatically fails the saving throw. You can possess only one borrowed ability at a time.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, its duration increases to 1 hour and the target loses the stolen power for the duration of the spell.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Cleric\|Cleric]]; [[List Spells Classes Druid\|Druid]]; [[List Spells Classes Sorcerer Divine Soul (XGE)\|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]
