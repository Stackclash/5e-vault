# Mire
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of sand mixed with water)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

When you cast this spell, you create a 10-foot-diameter pit of quicksand, sticky mud, or a similar dangerous natural hazard suited to the region. A creature that's in the area when the spell is cast or that enters the affected area must make a successful Strength saving throw or sink up to its waist and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] by the mire. From that point on, the mire acts as [[5. Mechanics/Traps Hazards/Quicksand.md\|quicksand]], but the DC for Strength checks to escape from the quicksand is equal to your spell save DC. A creature outside the mire trying to pull another creature free receives a +5 bonus on its Strength check.
