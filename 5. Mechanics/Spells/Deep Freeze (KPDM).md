# Deep Freeze
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of ice or quartz)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You send a blast of deep cold at a creature, dealing `dice:4d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d8`) cold damage to it and encasing it in ice. An encased creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] and takes an extra `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) cold damage at the start of its turn every round it remains encased. If the target of this spell makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it takes half the damage and none of the extra damage and is not encased in ice, but the ice that clings to its body reduces its speed by 15 feet (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) until it takes an action to remove the ice.

A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] target can take an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, breaking free of the ice on a success. Alternatively, another creature within 5 feet of the target can make a Strength check on its turn, freeing the creature on a success. The ice can also be attacked. It has AC 12, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
