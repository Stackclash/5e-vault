# Clearing the Field
*2nd-level, Transmutation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

With a harsh word and a vicious chopping motion, you cause every tree, shrub, and stump within 40 feet of you to sink into the ground, leaving the vacated area clear of plant life that might otherwise hamper movement or obscure sight. Overgrown areas that counted as difficult terrain become clear ground and no longer hamper movement. The original plant life instantly rises from the ground again when the spell ends or is dispelled. Plant creatures are not affected by *clearing the field*.

## Group Spellcasting

When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum duration of 8 hours.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, plant creatures in the area must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be affected as though by a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enlarge Reduce.md\|reduce]] spell.
