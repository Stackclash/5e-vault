Your foreknowledge allows you to act before others, because you knew what was going to happen. When you cast this spell, make a new initiative roll with a +5 bonus. If the result is higher than your current initiative, your place in the initiative order changes accordingly. If the result is also higher than the current place in the initiative order, you take your next turn immediately and then use the higher number starting in the next round.
