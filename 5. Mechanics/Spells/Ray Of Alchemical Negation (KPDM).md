# Ray of Alchemical Negation
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a ray of blazing, polychromatic energy from your fingertips. Make a ranged spell attack against an alchemical item or a trap that uses alchemy to achieve its ends, such as a trap that sprays acid, releases poisonous gas, or triggers an explosion of alchemist's fire. A hit destroys the alchemical reagents, rendering them harmless. The attack is made against the most suitable object Armor Class.

This spell can also be used against a creature within range that is wholly or partially composed of acidic, poisonous, or alchemical components, such as an alchemical golem or an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Ooze/Ochre Jelly.md\|ochre jelly]]. In that case, a hit deals `dice:6d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d6`) force damage, and the target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or it deals only half as much damage with its acidic, poisonous, or alchemical attacks for 1 minute. A creature whose damage is halved can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
