# Wall of Thorns
*6th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:7d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`7d8`) piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes `dice:7d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`7d8`) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each slot level above 6th.
