# Encroaching Shadows
*6th-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a drop of blood smeared on a silver rod worth 100 gp
- **Duration:** 12 hour

> [!note]
> This spell can only be cast as a ritual.

You cause menacing shadows to invade a cube 200 feet on a side and 50 feet high, centered on a point within range. Illumination in the area drops one step (from bright light to dim, or from dim light to darkness). Any spell that creates light in the area that is cast using a lower-level spell slot than was used to cast this spell is dispelled, and a spell that creates light doesn't function in the area if that spell is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or lower. Nonmagical effects can't increase the level of illumination in the affected area.

A spell that creates darkness or shadow takes effect in the area as if the spell slot expended was one level higher than the spell slot actually used.

## Group Spellcasting

When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, the spell lasts for an additional 12 hours for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum duration of 48 hours.

## Ritual Focus

If you expend your ritual focus, the spell's duration increases by 12 hours, and it cannot be dispelled by a spell that creates light, even if that spell is cast using a higher-level spell slot.
