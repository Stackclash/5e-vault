# Conjure Volley
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:8d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`8d8`) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.

**Classes**: [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Bard.md\|Bard]]; [Paladin (Oath of Thunder)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-thunder-kpdm.md "subclass=KPDM"); [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Spells Classes Ranger.md\|Ranger]]
