# Conjure Volley
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:8d8|noform|avg` (`8d8`) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.

**Classes**: [[List Spells Classes Bard\|Bard]]; [[List Spells Classes Ranger\|Ranger]]; [[List Spells Classes Paladin Oath Of Thunder (KPDM)\|Paladin (Oath of Thunder)]]
