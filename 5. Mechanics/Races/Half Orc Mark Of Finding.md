## Traits

### Age

Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.

### Size

Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Hunter's Intuition

When you make a Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) or Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]]) check, you can roll a `dice: d4|avg|noform` (`d4`) and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Finder's Magic

You can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hunters Mark.md\|hunter's mark]] spell with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Locate Object.md\|locate object]] spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Finding Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
