## Traits

Your ruun character has a number of traits common with all other ruun.

### Ability Score Increase

Your Constitution score increases by 2

### Age

Ruun live about as long as humans do, although they reach adulthood about twice as quickly.

### Alignment

Like most humanoids, ruun are as likely to be good as they are to be evil. Rangols still under the banner of Acridaethruix are more likely to be evil out of self-preservation, but are otherwise no different than their other frog kin in terms of predisposition.

### Size

Ruun are roughly human-sized and have a wide variety of builds. Your size is Medium.

### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

### Darkvision

Well-acclimated to seeing even in deep lakebottoms, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Amphibious

You can breathe air and water.

### Sea Speak

You can communicate simple ideas with beasts that can breathe water. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return.

### Standing Leap

Your long jump is up to 20 feet and your high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Many ruun know Draconic simply because of Laterreprosp's deeply-rooted draconic history. Others choose to learn Elvish, as elven poetry is especially prized as entertainment.

> [!note] Creating Your Ruun
> 
> When creating your ruun character, use these traits as a guide, rather than a rule. A typical ruun is fairly hardy, capable of withstanding strong sounds, poisons, and weather, which is reflected in the Ability Score Increase trait. However, your ruun may have prioritized other traits, either by simple nature or active pursuits. In that case, increase one ability score of your choice by 2, and another by 1, replacing the bonuses suggested in the Ruun Traits and chosen subrace. Alternatively, you can choose three different ability scores to increase by 1.

> Lastly, size can fluctuate wildly among frogs—both beastly and humanoid. When you select this race, you can choose to be Small, instead of Medium.

### Rooble

Roobles were brought into being by Entinxiir almost 750 years ago alongside their hardier ruglunk relatives. Their vocal frog ancestry leads many roobles to be excitable and boisterous. As a result, roobles often find work in social settings and politics, where their ostentatious leanings can be an invaluable asset. Many ruun entertainers are roobles, as well as great mages and businessfolk. Some of the most glorious tales—both truthful and tall—have been written and retold by roobles over generations, and while many grow up with dreams of heroism, few eventually manage to take the next step.

### Ability Score Increase

Your Charisma score increasesby 1.

### Natural Swimmer

You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

### Slippery

Your skin is naturally slippery. You can add a d4 to any check made to escape a grapple or restraint.

### Thunderous Croak

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a supersonic bellow, which is audible out to a range of 100 feet. Each other creature within 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.

On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much thunder damage and isn't deafened. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). At the end of each of its turns, a deafened creature can make another Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success. After you use your croak, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Description

Ruun are the frog-like people from Laterreprosp, a region of low wetlands and lakes wedged between human realms. Their homes typically lie either submerged or near the waters of ponds, rivers, or lakes. Ruun live a lifestyle akin to typical humans, as their early development as a people was spurred on by knowledge of their recorded history gleaned from books recovered from the dragon Entinxiir's abandoned hoard. In general, ruun enjoy fresh water, good stories, and feats of heroism. Written poetry, whether good or bad, is a common hobby and pleasure among them.

### Eager to Thrive

Centuries ago, the ruun were created by magical meddling spurred on by dragonic rivalries. In their efforts to control the region, competing dragons created the ruun as thralls. However, over time, these capable frogfolk outgrew and outlived their subserviance, and were forced to quickly adapt to their newfound independence. Using knowledge gleaned from abandoned draconic hoards, the ruun have rapidly become a stalwart member of civilization in a matter of mere centuries.

Because of their people's limited land and resources, abundant restrictions rarely deter ruun from attempting to find a solution:  even if the result is preposterous or laughably improvised. Ever eager to live up to and exceed the histories of their predecessors and the humans that they learned from, ruun are clever and productively competitive by necessity. When one ruun raises the bar, another almost always leaps over it again before long.

### An Amphibious Life

Life in Laterreprosp among the ruun is spent almost as much above water as it is below. As a result, hygiene is paramount to ruun society, as the universal need for water as both a means of drinking and transport means that any sort of pollution directly impacts the rest of the community. Roobles especially rely on water to keep their skin moist and pliable.

### The Sounds of Ruun

Many great pieces of ruun poetry were written of far-off lands. "Ode to the Unicorn" is amongst the most popular in Laterreprosp society, and speaks to the untold and alien beauty of the fey and their magical domain. Of course, plenty of the poem is exaggerated (including the eponymous unicorn itself) to the point where even elves find amusement in its accidental satire.

### Seeking Opportunity

The ruun that leave their ancestral home of Laterreprosp usually set out in search of a story or solution. Because of the relatively young age of ruun society, not everything can be found in the familiar wetlands, and the tales and opportunities from the outside world are a powerful draw.

### Ruun Names

Most ruun names are chosen for the rhythm they carry or the sound they make when rolled through their thunderous throats. After all, a name that stands the test of time should sound the part when recited in poetry or song. The structure of their names mimic those of typical human cultures, usually including at least a given and family name. However, virtually no distinction is made between what is considered a male or female name in ruun society, and normally gendered titles, such as duke or duchess, are self-declared by the ones receiving them.
