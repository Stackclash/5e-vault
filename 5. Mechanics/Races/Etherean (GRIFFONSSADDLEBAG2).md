## Traits

Your etherean character has a variety of traits as a result of their unique plane of origin.

### Ability Score Increase

Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

### Age

Ethereans mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.

### Alignment

Because of the strict code of conduct that's necessary when living in etherean society, most ethereans are lawful out of a sense of honor or decency. However, many ethereans enjoy setting silly pranks, provided that they aren't mean-spirited, in order to fulfill some of their more chaotic leanings. They have no particular inclination toward evil or good, although many that survive in the more untamed corners of the Ethereal Plane will end up evil out of necessity.

### Size

Ethereans are about the same size as humans and have willowy builds. Your size is Medium.

### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet. While on the Ethereal Plane, it increases to 35 feet.

### Darkvision

Accustomed to the chaotic and often unavoidable lighting of the Border Ethereal, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Misty Sight

Your eyes are naturally attuned to the Border Ethereal, allowing you to always see out to your normal range while on the Ethereal Plane.

You can also use a bonus action to focus on seeing the unseen. For 1 minute, or until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell), you can see [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]] creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Veil Shift

You can use an action while on the Material Plane to slip into the Ethereal Plane, and vice versa, until the start of your next turn. Any object you take while on this other plane of existence is left there when you return to your original one. While on the Ethereal Plane in this way, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane, and you still move as if you were on the Material Plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you or interact with you while you're there, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so, although you can still see and hear them. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Ethereans tend to learn the languages of neighboring creatures from the Material Plane.

> When creating your etherean character, use these traits as a guide, rather than a rule. A typical etherean is naturally charismatic, which is reflected in the Ability Score Increase trait, but yours may be quiet or reserved by comparison. In this case, increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and another by 1, or choose three different ability scores to increase by 1.
> 
> Similarly, your etherean may never have ascribed to the rigors of etherean society and has fully embraced their chaotic leanings. And, like all humanoids, size is hardly a defining factor: when you select this race, you can choose to be Small, instead of Medium.
> 
> Lastly, the suggested age trait is just that: a suggestion. In your world, the ethereans' fey ancestry may be more evident, resulting in a longer life span. Regardless, the life span of most player characters in fifth edition is about a century—presuming they don't meet a violent end on an adventure.

## Description

Ethereans are, as their name would suggest, the unlikely settlers of the Border Ethereal. They grow up experiencing the Material Plane from a distance, viewing it through the gray and muffling barrier between the planes of existence. Most ethereans live in small communities spread throughout the Border Ethereal and find joy in poetry, art, and theater that offsets the drab and relative lifelessness of their home. While only a few monsters are able to threaten those on the Border Ethereal, etherean survival is only maintainable through their tenacity and shared sense of decency. For many ethereans, the relative safety of the Ethereal Plane outweighs the richer experiences of the Material, but for those that do manage to cross that planar threshold, there is simply no comparison.

### An Obscure Lineage

Ethereans resemble elves with light gray skin, but their hair and eyes are distinctly different. Many ethereans' eyes and hair are either purple or magenta, but it's not unheard of for them to come in a full spectrum of colors—a curious result of living extensively on the Ethereal Plane. Further, an etherean's hair drifts and floats on its own, as if carried by an invisible current, before evaporating into nothing at its ends.

### Decent by Necessity

The Border Ethereal allows for a free range of movement in any direction, including through solid objects located on the Material Plane. As a result, privacy is extremely coveted by those on the Ethereal Plane, who are constantly aware of the near-impossibility of complete safety from others. Over generations, etherean culture has grown to uphold and teach a powerful focus on common decency between them. This often translates to relatively lawful communities among ethereans, who expect that their safety and privacy will be respected in exchange for their own adherence.

However, whether it be the result of a possible fey ancestry or defiance of their strict social structure, most ethereans have a deep appreciation of harmless pranks and practical jokes. In general, as long as it's in good fun, moments of levity like these are part of the fabric that keeps ethereans happy and entertained in an otherwise quiet and dull world.

> [!note] Ideal Travel Companions
> 
> Most ethereans are eager to make friends that aren't other ethereans and eschew sweeping generalizations. Earnest and excitable, ethereans make for spectacular traveling companions for people who enjoy conversations and storytelling.

### Worlds to Experience

Ethereans typically take up adventuring when the routine of the Border Ethereal no longer interests them. Such ethereans often go searching for a means of travel into the Material Plane, but only some manage to find them. Those that do are thrust into a world suddenly bound by gravity and rife with danger, but also filled with opportunity and new experiences. Many ethereans will happily accept contracts to travel great distances or visit exotic realms, regardless of danger, in order to make the most of their life beyond the Border Ethereal.

Ethereans will often choose to spend their coin on brightly colored and ostentatious clothing, seemingly making up for the limited color palettes they may have experienced on the Border Ethereal. Others fall victim to new vices, but more often than not, strict etherean resourcefulness is enough to prevent all but the most vulnerable ethereans from becoming addicted to the pleasures of the Material Plane.

### Etherean Names

An etherean has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Etherean nicknames often sound purposefully silly, and are just as likely to be self-given as they are by friends or family.
