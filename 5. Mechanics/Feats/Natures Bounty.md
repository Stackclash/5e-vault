# Nature's Bounty
*Source: Hamund's Herbalism Handbook p. 39*  

Your attunement to nature causes you to find more herbs wherever you go, almost as if nature itself is attempting to aid you. Whenever you gather a herb, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 20, you gain an extra copy of the herb you just gathered.
