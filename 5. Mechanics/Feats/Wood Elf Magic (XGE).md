# Wood Elf Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 75*  

***Prerequisites*** Elf (Wood)

You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Longstrider.md|longstrider]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Pass Without Trace.md|pass without trace]] spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
