# Crossbow Expert
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 165*  

Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.  
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.  
- When you use the [[\5. Mechanics\Rules\Actions.md#Attack|Attack]] action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a [[5. Mechanics\Items\Hand Crossbow.md|hand crossbow]] you are holding.
