***Prerequisites*** Dexterity 13 or higher

You are expert at slinking through shadows. You gain the following benefits:

- You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.  
- When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged weapon attack, making the attack doesn't reveal your position.  
- Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom ([[5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception|Perception]]) checks relying on sight.
