*Source: Player's Handbook p. 167*  

You have a mind that can track time, direction, and detail with uncanny precision. You gain the following benefits:

- You always know which way is north.  
- You always know the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset.  
- You can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month.
