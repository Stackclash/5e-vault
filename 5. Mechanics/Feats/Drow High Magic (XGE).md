# Drow High Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

***Prerequisites*** Elf (Drow)

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Levitate.md\|levitate]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]], each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
