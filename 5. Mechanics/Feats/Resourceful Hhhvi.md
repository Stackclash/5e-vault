# Resourceful
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 146*  

You've always hated leaving anything to waste and have always made sure you get the most out of any situation.

- You gain proficiency in the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]] and the herbalism kit.  
- You ignore any penalties for harvesting a creature that died a "particularly violent death".  
- Both "appraising" and "harvesting" a creature take half the time than it normally would.
