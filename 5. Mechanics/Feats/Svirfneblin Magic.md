***Prerequisites*** [[5. Mechanics/Races/Gnome Deep.md\|Gnome (Deep) (DMG)]]

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Nondetection.md\|nondetection]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blindness Deafness.md\|blindness/deafness]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blur.md\|blur]], and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Disguise Self.md\|disguise self]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
