# Script Sage
*Source: Deep Magic p. 215*  

Through dedicated study, you have mastered one hieroglyph of your choice. Choose one [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Optfeaturetype Hieroglyph.md\|hieroglyph]] that you have already learned through [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Script Carver (KPDM).md\|Script Carver]]. You can invoke one of its mastery powers, provided you meet any other requirements, such as a minimum level.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you learn the mastery powers of a different hieroglyph from your repertoire.
