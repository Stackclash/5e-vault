# Polearm Master
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  

You can keep your enemies at bay with reach weapons. You gain the following benefits:

- When you take the [[\5. Mechanics\Rules\Actions.md#Attack|Attack]] action and attack with only a [[5. Mechanics\Items\Glaive.md|glaive]], [[5. Mechanics\Items\Halberd.md|halberd]], [[5. Mechanics\Items\Quarterstaff.md|quarterstaff]], or [[5. Mechanics\Items\Spear.md|spear]], you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon; this attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a `dice: d4` (`d4`), and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.  
- While you are wielding a [[5. Mechanics\Items\Glaive.md|glaive]], [[5. Mechanics\Items\Halberd.md|halberd]], [[5. Mechanics\Items\Pike.md|pike]], [[5. Mechanics\Items\Quarterstaff.md|quarterstaff]], or [[5. Mechanics\Items\Spear.md|spear]], other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.
