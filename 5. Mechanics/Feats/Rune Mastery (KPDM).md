# Rune Mastery
*Source: Deep Magic p. 237*  

You have mastered the special powers of one rune. Choose one [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Optfeaturetype Rune.md\|rune]] that you have already learned through [[5. Mechanics/Feats/Rune Knowledge (KPDM).md\|Rune Knowledge]]. You can invoke one of its mastery powers, provided you meet any other requirements such as a minimum level.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you learn the mastery powers of a different rune from your repertoire.
