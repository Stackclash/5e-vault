# Grappler
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 167. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

***Prerequisites*** Strength 13 or higher

You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.  
- You can use your action to try to pin a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] until the grapple ends.
