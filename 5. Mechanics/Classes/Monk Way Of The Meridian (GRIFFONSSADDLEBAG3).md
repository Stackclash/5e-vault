## Class Features

### Way of the Meridian (Level 3)

Monks of the Way of the Meridian are capable healers and acupuncturists that learn to activate the bodys own restorative and self-destructive functions through careful application of pressure and piercing strikes. With precision and speed, they can enhance their allies or cripple their enemies using knowledge and techniques that have stood the test of time.

### Pointed Strikes (Level 3)

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special training has led you to master additional weapons as part of your craft. You gain proficiency with blowguns, which are considered monk weapons for you. Darts and blowgun needles are also considered monk weapons for you, which can be used as either melee or thrown weapons with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or monk weapon that deals piercing damage, you can expend 1 ki point to impose one of the following effects on the target. You can use this feature twice on each of your turns.

#### Disable

You weaken the creatures motor skills and coordination. The next attack roll the creature makes before the end of your next turn is made with disadvantage.

#### Expose
_Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 3_

You cause the creatures body to become sluggish and vulnerable. The next attack roll that you or another creature makes against the target before the end of your next turn is made with advantage.

Alternatively, you can apply one of these effects to the first target you hit as part of your Flurry of Blows, without spending the ki point for this feature.

### Medicinal Knowledge (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, your knowledge of the body and the energy that runs through it grants you proficiency in the Medicine skill. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in the Insight or Sleight of Hand skill (your choice). When you make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, you can choose to expend 1 ki point to reroll the d20. You must use the new roll. You can choose to do so after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined.

In addition, you can use an action to touch a creature and expend 2 ki points to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enhance Ability.md\|enhance ability]] spell on it. Starting when you reach 6th level in this class, you can harmlessly launch a blowgun needle or dart at the target, instead of touching it, in order to deliver the spell. The target must be within the weapons normal range.

### Restoring Touch (Level 6)

By 6th level, you can cause a creatures body to rapidly heal itself. As an action, or in place of one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can touch a willing creature to cause it to supernaturally regain hit points as if it finished a short rest. Alternatively, you can harmlessly launch a blowgun needle or dart at the target to deliver the effect, instead of touching it. The target must be within the weapons normal range.

The creature rolls a number of Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus, without expending them, and adds its Constitution modifier to the result of each die as normal. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the total. Once a creature regains hit points in this way, it can not do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Improved Pointed Strikes (Level 11)

At 11th level, you have become a master of precision with your debilitating strikes. When you hit a creature and use either your Disable or Expose feature, you can apply both effects at the same time without spending another ki point.

If you attack a creature under the effect of your Expose feature and hit it, that creature also takes a penalty to any Constitution saving throw it makes as a result of or as part of the attack, such as from your Stunning Strike. The penalty is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

### Total Restoration (Level 17)

At 17th level, you can restore the balance of energy and health to creatures under your care. You can use an action to touch a creature and expend 5 ki points to simultaneously cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] spells on it, requiring no material components, and cause the target to regain up to 5 expended Hit Dice. Alternatively, you can harmlessly launch a blowgun needle or dart at the target, instead of touching it, in order to deliver the spells. The target must be within the weapons normal range.

Once a creature has benefited from this feature, it can not do so again until it finishes a long rest.
