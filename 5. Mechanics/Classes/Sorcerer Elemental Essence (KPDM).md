## Class Features

### Elemental Essence (Level 1)

Your innate magic arises from elemental power suffused into your being. You might have an elemental creature, such as genie, in your ancestry. Perhaps you lived most of your life near a portal to one of the Elemental Planes, and the ambient magic of the plane saturated everything you ate and drank. Perhaps a magical conjuring went awry, and the essence of an elemental merged with your own. Whatever the ultimate source, you are a walking conduit to an elemental plane.

### Elemental Heritage (Level 1)

At 1st level, choose one element from the Elemental Heritage table. You can speak, read, and write the language associated with your heritage, and its damage type is used by features you gain later.

**Elemental Heritage**

| Element | Language | Damage Type |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Air | Primordial | Lightning or Thunder (choose one) |
| Earth | Primordial | Buldgeoning |
| Fire | Primordial | Fire |
| Water | Primordial | Cold |

### Manifest Aura (Level 1)

Starting when you choose this Origin at 1st level, you are able to channel your elemental power into a swirling aura. As a bonus action, you can surround yourself in a magical aura of elemental material or energy appropriate to your heritage element for 1 minute. While the aura persists, you gain the following benefits:

- When you are attacked, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.  
- When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, the aura around you intensifies until the start of your next turn. During this time, any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you or that enters that area takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) damage of the type associated with your heritage element. This damage increases to `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) when you reach 7th level.  

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Infuse Elements (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to the damage type associated with your heritage.

Additionally, when you damage a creature with a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to enhance it with the power of your heritage element. The spell takes on a visual cast that reflects the elemental infusion (fire and embers dance in the area, wind swirls around a bolt of energy, and so forth) and delivers the following additional effects depending on your heritage:

- **Air..** The creature is buffeted by strong winds, arcs of Lighting, and claps of thunder. It can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.  
- **Earth..** The creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]] until the start of your next turn.  
- **Fire..** The creature is seared by your fiery magic. It is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] until the end of its next turn. Creatures that are immune to fire are unaffected.  
- **Water..** The creature is disoriented as the world seems to roll and pitch in waves. It is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.  

### Elemental Jaunt (Level 14)

At 14th level, you can Teleport by skimming the outer boundary of the Elemental Planes. As a bonus action, you can magically Teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. When you appear, you can create one of the following effects, depending on your heritage element:

- **Air..** When you appear within 5 feet of an area of wind (whether natural or magical), you create a cyclonic burst of wind. All creatures within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) slashing damage and be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] by dust and debris until the start of your next turn.  
- **Earth..** When you appear within 5 feet of nonmagical, unworked stone filling at least one 5-foot square, you create tremors in the earth that ripple outward from you. Each creature within 10 feet of you that is touching the ground must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage and fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].  
- **Fire..** When you appear within 5 feet of a fire at least the size of a campfire, you create a burst of flame around yourself. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) fire damage and catch on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, a creature on fire takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.  
- **Water..** When you appear within 5 feet of at least 50 gallons of water, you create a torrent of water that assails the creatures around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and choke on the water that forces its way into the creature's throat. A choking creature can't speak and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn. Creatures that don't have to breathe or that can breathe water aren't subject to choking.  

Saving throws against these effects are made against your spell save DC. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Elemental Soul (Level 18)

At 18th level, you gain immunity to the damage type associated with your heritage element.

Depending on your elemental heritage, you also gain one of the following benefits:

- **Air..** You gain a magical flying speed equal to your current walking speed. Additionally, during your turn you can spend 1 sorcery point to become insubstantial wind and mist. Until the start of your next turn, you can enter a hostile creature's space, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, you are immune to the effects of Strong Wind, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.  
- **Earth..** You gain a burrowing speed equal to your current walking speed, and you can Burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, you don't disturb the material you move through. Additionally, you can spend 1 sorcery point to become stony and unyielding until the start of your next turn. During this time, you have resistance to piercing and slashing damage, you are immune to poison damage, and you can't be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Petrified\|petrified]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].  
- **Fire..** Your speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, during your turn you can spend 1 sorcery point to become fiery and insubstantial. Until the start of your next turn, you can move through a hostile creature's space. The first time you enter a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) fire damage and catches on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, a creature on fire takes `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`d10`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.  
- **Water..** You gain a swimming speed equal to your current walking speed, and you can breathe both water and air. Additionally, during your turn you can spend 1 sorcery point to take on a watery form. Until the start of your next turn, you can enter a hostile creature's space and move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. When you enter a hostile creature's space, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or fall [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].
