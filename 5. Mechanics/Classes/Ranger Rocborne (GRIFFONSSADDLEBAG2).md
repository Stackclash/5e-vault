## Class Features

### Rocborne (Level 3)

The Rocborne are nomads of the sky who travel the world on the backs of ancestral rocs. These travelers understand that the air and wind aren't just one force but the collective effort of untold numbers of spirits that are carried along by it. By listening to the wind the same way a medium beckons to the dead, a Rocborne can learn more about the weather, their path forward, and even themselves. Many Rocborne grow up and live in this culture for their entire lives, but some have been known to begin their own journeys. Alternatively, your path may have been crossed by a powerful windborne spirit later on in life, allowing you to suddenly feel and heed the guiding wind inside you.

By calling on the spirits of the wind to aid them, rangers of this archetype can exert a degree of control over both wind and weather. These skills were passed down from the rocs to the first Rocborne and continue to live on through the dedicated instruction of Rocborne elders, both living and dead. You may be taught these skills or have them passed on to you through the guidance of Rocborne spirits in whispers, dreams, or in moments of deep meditation.

### Rocborne Magic (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Rocborne Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Guiding Wind (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, when you make an attack, you can whisper to the wind to have it aid your strikes. Once on each of your turns, you can choose to gain one of the following benefits:

- When you hit with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) damage of the weapon's type. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`).  
- When you miss with a weapon attack, you can change its trajectory to attack a different target up to 5 feet away from the original one and within range of your weapon. When you do, your attack roll against the new target is equal to the original attack roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +0). When you reach 11th level in this class, the new target can be up to 15 feet away as long as it's still within range of your weapon.  

### Whispers of Knowledge (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, you can seek knowledge through meditation by calling upon the spirits carried on the wind. You can spend 10 minutes communing with these spirits to gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice that you don't already have proficiency in, as a traveling spirit shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency the next time you use this feature or finish a short or long rest.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Windswept (Level 7)

By 7th level, the wind clears a path for you and ushers you forward. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet, you ignore any movement penalty caused by strong wind, and you can't be pushed because of strong wind against your will.

In addition, you have resistance to cold damage, and you're acclimated to high altitudes, including elevations above 20,000 feet.

### Soar (Level 11)

At 11th level, you can use a bonus action immediately after you make a running jump to grow a pair of spectral, roc-like wings that last until the end of your next turn or until you touch the ground again. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

### Hurricane (Level 15)

At 15th level, your connection to the wind is so strong that its spirits can come to your defense as a magical, buffeting tempest. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage, or take no damage instead if it was falling damage. When you do, each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your ranger level and is knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

When you use this feature, you can choose to allow the wind spirits to immediately fly you to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, without provoking opportunity attacks.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
