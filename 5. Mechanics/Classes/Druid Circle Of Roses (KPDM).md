## Class Features

### Circle of Roses (Level 2)

Druids of the Circle of Roses bend the power of nature to influence the minds and hearts of those around them, soothing sorrow, crushing with terror, and ensnaring hearts in equal measure. They create sweet and bitter perfumes that carry their power to any who inhale the scent.

### Circle Spells (Level 2)

Your deep bond with the ebb and flow of nature grants you knowledge of certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Friends.md\|friends]] cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Roses Spells table.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 2)

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in one skill chosen from the following: [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]].

### Bittersweet Perfume (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can expend one use of Wild Shape as an action to create a floral perfume that manipulates the minds of those who breathe it, rather than transforming into a beast form. One creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On each of your turns while the perfume lasts, you can use an action to choose a different creature to affect with your perfume.

On a failure, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] by you (your choice) for as long as it remains in your perfume and for 1 minute after it leaves the area. If it ends its turn outside the area, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If you or your allies attack or harm the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature, it is no longer charmed.

If the creature's saving throw is successful or if the effect ends for it, it is immune to your perfume for the next 24 hours. A creature that doesn't breathe or that is immune to poison is immune to your perfume.

The perfume lasts for 10 minutes or until you use your Wild Shape again.

### Overpowering Remedy (Level 6)

At 6th level, your perfume can affect one creature of your choice within 20 feet of you, and you can use the scent of your perfume to unravel harmful effects. When you use your Bittersweet Perfume, you can choose to end one disease or one condition affecting a creature in your perfume instead of charming or frightening it. The condition removed can be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].

### Rose's Thorns (Level 10)

At 10th level, you can stab thorns at the minds of those who dare raise their hand against you. When a creature within 20 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage.

### Lingering Perfume (Level 14)

When you reach 14th level, a whiff of your perfume surrounds you at all times and lingers in your wake. You are immune to harmful gasses and vapors, you have advantage on saving throws against be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and your Bittersweet Perfume now lasts for 1 hour or until you use your Wild Shape again.

In addition, you can intensify the power of your perfume. When a creature becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] by your Bittersweet Perfume, you can use a bonus action to wrap some of your perfume around it. That creature is considered to be within your perfume, no matter how far it moves away from you, for 1 hour or until you use your Wild Shape again. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
