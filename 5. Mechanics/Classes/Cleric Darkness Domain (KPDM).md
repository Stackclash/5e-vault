## Class Features

### Darkness Domain (Level 1)

Darkness enshrouds our private affairs and shelters our secrets. The shadows may protect the hunted from the hunter or conceal danger. Emissaries of the gods who claim dominion over the darkness may provide protection for those in need or aid those who hunt in the night, if they are not themselves the hunters.

### Creature of Darkness (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in either Deception or Stealth skill (your choice). While in dim light or darkness, you can take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action as a bonus action.

### Channel Divinity: Shadowsight (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] (60 feet) for 1 hour. If you already have [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] as a racial characteristic, using your Channel Divinity this way allows you to see in magical darkness to a distance of 30 feet as if it were dim light, for 1 hour.

### Shadow Meld (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to merge your current location with the version of it that exists on the plane of shadow. The affected area is a sphere with a 60-foot radius centered on you. Within that area, bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes equivalent to magical darkness. The temperature plummets; all creatures other than you in the darkened sphere at the end of their turns must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold damage. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. There's a chance, if the GM allows, that `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Shadow.md\|shadows]] might step through into your world when the effect ends. Such creatures might or might not be hostile.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).

### Shadow Shield (Level 17)

Beginning at 17th level, your shadow begins defending you. Each time you are hit by a nonmagical attack or effect that causes damage, your shadow flows across your body and absorbs half of the damage. When your shadow has absorbed damage equal to one-fourth of your maximum hit points, it vanishes completely until you finish a long rest.
