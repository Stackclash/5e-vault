## Class Features

### Justice Domain (Level 1)

All seek some form of justice when they have been wronged, and many live under the promise of its protection, whether or not the promise is kept, but few take on the holy burden of delivering the justice of the gods. The mercy of the gods, when in evidence at all, is not the mercy of mortals, and meting it out makes for a lonely life. Yet most agree on the urgent need for justice in the world, with all of its dark places and rulers who give it little thought. Someone must make the sacrifice.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.

### Channel Divinity: No Hiding Place (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to determine the general direction of a creature that is guilty of an injustice or that is wanted for commission of a serious crime. At 7th level, you can determine the distance in miles to the creature as well as the direction.

### Hand of Justice (Level 6)

At 6th level, you become immune to the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] condition.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`).

### Holy Denunciation (Level 17)

At 17th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to persuade others that you hold divine authority to mete out justice. You must present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. So long as your deity is one that is worshipped openly in the land where you are asserting this authority, you have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks involving justice, judgment, and the law, up to and including execution for crimes.
