## Class Features

### Hunger Domain (Level 1)

You have dedicated your life to the satisfaction of your appetites, sometimes at the cost of others' needs. You are never truly sated, but you know that hunger leads to power.

### Unsated (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn the poison spray cantrip. You also gain proficiency in the Survival skill and with cooking tools.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 1)

You gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Channel Divinity: Ferocious Feast (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you can use your channel divinity to gain a bite attack for 1 minute. The bite does `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) + your Strength modifier piercing damage. On a critical hit, you can also add your Wisdom modifier to the damage roll in addition to the normal benefits of a critical hit.

### Revitalize (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, you can remove the effect of a disease, a poison or the poisoned condition, or one level of exhaustion from yourself as an action. You must finish a long rest before using this ability again.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) necrotic damage to the target. When the cleric reaches 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`).

### Ravening Horde (Level 17)

At 17th level, you can sacrifice the vitality of those around you and inspire an insatiable and horrifying hunger in them. Living creatures within 60 feet of you who fail a Charisma saving throw take `dice:10d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`10d8`) necrotic damage and then succumb to a ravening hunger, dropping whatever they hold in their hands and attacking the unaffected with their hands and teeth, or with whatever natural weapons they possess, in an attempt to devour them. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. Each affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. You can exclude up to ten creatures from the effect, but this doesn't shield them against being attacked by those who do succumb. This ability doesn't affect constructs or the undead.
