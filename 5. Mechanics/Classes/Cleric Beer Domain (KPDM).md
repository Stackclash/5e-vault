### Disciple of the Draught (Level 1)

At 1st level, you learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Message.md\|message]] cantrip. You also gain proficiency in either [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Medicine\|Medicine]] (your choice), and you gain proficiency with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Brewers Supplies.md\|brewer's supplies]]. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses those supplies.

### Channel Divinity: Blessed Brew (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to transform a container of nonmagical liquid into blessed brew; the number of doses equals 3 + your Wisdom modifier. Any special attributes the liquid previously had are negated. Anyone who imbibes one dose of this brew can choose one of the following benefits: advantage on Charisma-based skill checks, a +1 bonus to AC, or a +1 increase to the DC of saving throws against their castings of enchantment spells. This bonus lasts for 1 hour, leaving a warm buzz behind when it fades. A creature can benefit from only one dose of blessed brew between rests. An hour after creating blessed brew, the liquid turns into tasty, but mundane, beer.

### Channel Divinity: Boot and Rally (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to aid and rally your allies. All friendly creatures within 30 feet of you who are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] gain an immediate saving throw with advantage to remove the effect. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw also heal `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) hit points.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with radiant energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`).

### Fire in the Belly (Level 17)

At 17th level, you gain resistance to cold, poison, and psychic damage.
