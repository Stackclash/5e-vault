## Class Features

### Shadow Bloodline (Level 1)

Your magic comes from a place drained of color, where light fights a losing battle against the Relentless encroachment of Darkness. In the distant past, your ancestors were Touched by the Shadow Realm, and this contact left its mark on your Family bloodline.

Except as noted below, Shadow bloodline sorcerers function as sorcerers and use the Sorcerer spell list.

### Taint of Shadow (Level 1)

Your magic always acts a bit differently from that of other casters. Your magical fire burns with a deep purple flame that sheds little light but casts inky shadows. The Influence of the Shadow Realm can be seen in every manifestation of your magic, whether that's shadowy bonds tightening around the target of a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hold Person.md\|hold person]] spell or the shadows that swirl like storm clouds inside your Dimension Door. At 1st level, you gain [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#Darkvision\|darkvision]] out to 60 feet. Within that range, you see through magical darkness as if it were dim light.

### Evil Eye (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you can gaze at one creature within 60 feet of you and with a bonus action, mark that creature with Darkness. The marked creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll or skill check involving sight unless it makes a successful Charisma saving throw. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Dark Illusions (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws against Illusion magic. You can also cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blur.md\|blur]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Mirror Image.md\|mirror image]] by spending 2 Sorcery Points.

### Passage Through the Dark (Level 14)

At 14th level, you gain the ability to traverse between patches of Darkness. When you are lightly or heavily obscured you can, as a bonus action, step through a shadow and emerge from another shadow up to 200 feet away. You can stay inside the shadow connection for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you choose to; while there, you are [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Invisible\|invisible]], nothing can affect you, and you can't affect anything else. Each use of this ability costs you 4 Sorcery Points.

### Tainted Shadows (Level 18)

Beginning at 18th level, you can emanate an aura of energy from the Shadow Realm. By spending 4 Sorcery Points, you radiate an aura of Shadow that causes everything within 15 feet of you to become lightly obscured because of dim lighting. Any portion of that area that's already dimly lit becomes completely dark instead. Enemy creatures that start their turns inside this aura take 10 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of this effect. The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
