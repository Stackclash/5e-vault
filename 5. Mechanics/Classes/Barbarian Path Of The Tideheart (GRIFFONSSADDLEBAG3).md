## Class Features

### Path of the Tideheart (Level 3)

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Tideheart are attuned to the primal forces of water, drawing strength from its unyielding power and ever-changing nature. These fierce warriors have unlocked the secrets of waters versatility, transforming them into mighty storms that can not be held at bay. Their rage ebbs and flows between power and agility, allowing them to tear through battlefields with unparalleled ease. Whether roaring like a wave or finding stillness beneath a waterfall, these barbarians are a primal force to be reckoned with who harness their inner calm before unleashing the tempest within.

### Crashing Wave (Level 3)

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you harness the simultaneous fluidity and strength of water. When you enter your rage, you can immediately move up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, provided that your speed is not 0.

In addition, while you are raging, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, that target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the weapons type and is pushed up to 5  feet away from you. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

### Graceful Currents (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, your water-like rage allows you to move with a fluid grace. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack while you are raging, you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, provided you have enough movement remaining.

You also gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and if you are moved against your will, you can choose the direction in which you are moved as long as its not toward the source of the effect.

### Tranquility (Level 10)

At 10th level, you can foster calm like a still pool. You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws.

In addition, you can use an action to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Calm Emotions.md\|calm emotions]] spell on a creature that you are touching, without expending a spell slot. The save DC for this spell is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. This version of the spell does not require concentration and can be cast even while raging; if you use your action to cast it, you do not need to take damage or make an attack in order to maintain your rage for the duration of the spell. You can use this feature 4 times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Torrential Flow (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, your fluid movements are unmatched in their strength and momentum. Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can move through another creatures space, regardless of its size. When you take the Attack action and make a separate weapon attack against two or more different targets, you can make one additional attack as part of the same action.
