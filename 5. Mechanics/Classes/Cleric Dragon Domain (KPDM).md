## Class Features

### Dragon Domain (Level 1)

When it comes to beings of awesome power, dragons reign supreme. How much more awe-inspiring, then, must be the gods dragons worship? Dragons embody many things: mastery of the elements and the most unforgiving environments, sagacity, long life, and an eternal hunger to acquire greater wealth and power. Those who worship dragons or the gods of dragons may strive to embody several, or perhaps even all, of these qualities themselves.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 1)

You are proficient in the Arcana skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill. You also have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

### Channel Divinity: Charmer of Reptiles (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm nonintelligent reptiles. As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each reptilian creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While a reptile is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you, it is friendly to you and to other creatures you designate.

### Dragon's Resistance (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, as a reaction when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to expend one use of your Channel Divinity to succeed on that saving throw instead.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).

### Frightful Presence (Level 17)

At 17th level, you gain a Frightful Presence attack similar to a dragon's. Using your Frightful Presence is an action. After using your Frightful Presence, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you and aware of you must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw succeeds or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
