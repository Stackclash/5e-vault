## Class Features

### Fey Trapper (Level 3)

The trappers of the fey courts are legendary to any mortal that shares that profession. Trained in methods as old as the courts themselves, these trappers utilise indomitable physical prowess, uncanny survival skills, and ancient nature magic to get the job done. They venture out into the dangerous Feywild and return laden with rare meats and exotic pelts for the capricious fey lords and ladies that employ them. Some of these rangers have taught their skills to outsiders, but all of them specialise in cornering their quarries, and then taking them down in one swift, clean blow.

### Fey Trapper Magic (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Trapper Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Cornered Prey (Level 3)

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you know how to strike more effectively when your prey has nowhere to run. You have advantage on weapon attacks against any creature that is standing on difficult terrain or that currently has less than its normal amount of speed.

### Clean Killer (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you learn the best way to slaughter your prey to ensure maximum yield from the carcass. When you kill a creature with a weapon attack, the DC for all "harvesting" checks made on that creature are reduced by 5.

### Glamoured Lure (Level 7)

Starting at 7th level, you learn to attract your prey and lower their defences with magical enchantments. As an action, you may force a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. Your favoured enemy has disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failure, that creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 minute or until they take damage.

While you have a creature [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] in this way, you may use your bonus action to create a pale marble of light within 60 feet of you in a space you can see. At the start of their turn, the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] creature must use as much of their movement to move towards that marble of light as possible, staying in that spot if they manage to reach it. If moving towards the marble requires the creature to enter terrain that would directly harm them, such as a pit of lava or a deep pit, they may make the saving throw again, ending the charm on a success. On subsequent turns, you may use another bonus action to move the marble of light to another space within 60 feet of you that you can see.

Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Binding Blow (Level 11)

At 11th level, you learn to infuse your attacks with a fey enchantment that restricts your prey. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, they must make a Strength saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failure, that creature's movement speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

### Tactical Advantage (Level 15)

When you reach 15th level in this class, any time you hit a creature with a weapon attack that was rolled at advantage, that creature is marked by you until the start of your next turn. While marked, a creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls it makes against you, and you have advantage on any saving throws imposed by them.
