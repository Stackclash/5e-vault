## Class Features

### Griffon Scout (Level 3)

The elves of the Griffon Court are practical and disciplined, well suited to surviving in their isolated holding on a windswept crag jutting out of the Margreve. Trained by elven court veterans, rangers of the Griffon Scout archetype learn to move swiftly and stealthily both on foot and while mounted, gathering information on their enemies or delivering devastating hit-and-run raids with precision and coordination.

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Griffon Scout Spells table. The spell counts as a Ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

**Griffon Scout Spells**

### Mounted Scout (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks while mounted, and your Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks apply to both you and your mount.

### Skirmisher's Step (Level 3)

At 3rd level, when you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee weapon attack in the same turn, that attack deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target, and, when you or your mount move out of the target's reach before the end of your next turn, you don't provoke an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attack]] from the target.

### Mounted Scout (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you have advantage on Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks while mounted, and your Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks apply to both you and your mount.

### Skirmisher's Step (Level 3)

At 3rd level, when you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee weapon attack in the same turn, that attack deals an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target, and, when you or your mount move out of the target's reach before the end of your next turn, you don't provoke an [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack\|opportunity attack]] from the target.

### Coordinated Strikes (Level 7)

Starting at 7th level, you can deliver punishing flurries of attacks in perfect coordination with your allies. When one of your allies hits a target within 30 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that target.

### Griffon Wings (Level 11)

At 11th level, when you cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Steed.md\|find steed]], you can choose for your steed to take the form of a Griffon, though it is a fey instead of a Monstrosity.

### Strike and Fade (Level 15)

Starting at 15th level, when you or your mount move at least 20 feet during Your Turn, you become an evasive blur. Until the start of your next turn, a creature that attacks you has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against you or your mount.
