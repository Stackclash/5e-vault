## Class Features

### Second Soul (Level 1)

Within your mortal frame lies two souls that have been bound together like twin stars. Inexplicable magic arcs between them, creating a unique power within you that was never there before. This soul is undead by its very nature, as its mere existence defies the normal laws of life. Maybe your birth was marked by a lost twin, or a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Revivify.md\|revivify]] spell entwined another spirit with yours by mistake. Perhaps a ghosts possession went awry, and now its soul is forever tied to yours.

### Second Soul Magic (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Second Soul Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it does not count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an enchantment or necromancy spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

### Touch of the Departed (Level 1)

At 1st level, choose an alignment and background for your second soul. You gain one language or proficiency of your choice from that background, and you gain an additional one from it when you reach 6th level in this class, and again at 14th and 18th levels. The soul can also sustain you in emergencies. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature once between long rests, or twice between long rests starting at 14th level.

You also learn the chill touch cantrip, which does not count against the number of cantrips you know.

### Font of Duality (Level 6)

By 6th level, your latent connection to undeath grants you resistance to necrotic damage. You also gain the Twinned Spell Metamagic option, which does not count against the total number you can have. If you already have this option, you can choose a different one instead.

You can choose to ignore the sorcery point cost when you use Twinned Spell with a spell of 2nd level or lower. Once you use it in this way, you can not do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Soul Split (Level 6)

Also at 6th level, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell once, without expending a spell slot or material components. When you do, your second soul is manifested as the familiar, which takes the form of an undead will-o-wisp. Its alignment, personality, and known languages are the same as the souls, and it uses your spell save DC for its Consume Life feature. While the familiar is summoned, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points when either you or the familiar slay a creature.

If the familiar is reduced to 0 hit points or if you dismiss it, your second soul returns to you until you summon the familiar again. Once you cast find familiar in this way, you can not do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 1 sorcery point to cast it again.

When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use a bonus action to teleport to the same space as the familiar, provided that its not already in another creatures space. To do so, you must be able to see the familiar and be within 30 feet of it. Further, while the ghostly hand from your chill touch cantrip clings to a target, your familiar can use its action to make a Shock attack against that creature as if it were within 5 feet of the target.

### Pain Split (Level 14)

By 14th level, you can magically share your allies burdens. When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take half of that damage, reducing the damage taken by the creature. This feature does not transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and the damage you take can not be reduced in any way. If your familiar takes damage, you do not need to be able to see it in order to use this feature, and the range becomes 100 feet, instead of 30.

### Life Siphon (Level 18)

At 18th level, when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you can choose to siphon away a portion of its life to regain hit points. Choose a number of the necrotic damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one); you regain a number of hit points equal to the total of the chosen dice. Once you use this feature, you can not do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
