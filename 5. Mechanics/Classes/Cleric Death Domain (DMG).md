## Class Features

### Death Domain (Level 1)

The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Dragonlance Chemosh (PHB).md\|Chemosh]], Myrkul, and [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Greyhawk Wee Jas.md\|Wee Jas]] are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder ([[5. Mechanics/Deities/Egyptian Anubis.md\|Anubis]], Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain ([[5. Mechanics/Deities/Greyhawk Iuz.md\|Iuz]] or Loviatar), disease or poison ([[5. Mechanics/Deities/Greyhawk Incabulos.md\|Incabulos]], Talona, or [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Dragonlance Morgion (PHB).md\|Morgion]]), and the underworld ([[5. Mechanics/Deities/Greek Hades.md\|Hades]] and [[5. Mechanics/Deities/Norse Hel.md\|Hel]]).

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 1)

When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or she gains proficiency with martial weapons.

### Reaper (Level 1)

At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

### Channel Divinity: Touch of Death (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch.

When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice his or her cleric level.

### Inescapable Destruction (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, the cleric's ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by the character's cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, the cleric gains the ability to infuse his or her weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of the cleric's turns when he or she hits a creature with a weapon attack, the cleric can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) necrotic damage to the target. When the cleric reaches 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`).

### Blessed Strikes (Level 8)
_Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 30_

*8th-level cleric [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Variant Rules/Optional Class Features (TCE).md\|optional feature]], which replaces the Divine Strike feature*

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

### Improved Reaper (Level 17)

Starting at 17th level, when the cleric casts a Necromancy spell of 1st through 5th-level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, the cleric must provide them for each target.
