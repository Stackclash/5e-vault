## Class Features

### The Unbroken Circle (Level 2)

The Unbroken Circle is an order of druids who have abandoned the patient teachings of their predecessors, deciding instead to take up arms in defense of the wilderness. These combative druids form militias and harness the fury of nature itself to forcefully remove any encroaching evil that threatens their sacred lands.

While the chaotic bend of nature is found within these druids, their bodies and impulses are tamed through training and discipline. Originally from the unforgiving Festerwood, this circle's teachings are as rigorous as the forest, blending a mixture of offense and defense to stand up to all of the world's challenges.

### Improved Shillelagh (Level 2)

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. In addition, you learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shillelagh.md\|shillelagh]] cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different druid cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast shillelagh, you can use it to imbue any melee weapon you're holding with nature's power. If you're holding a weapon under the effects of shillelagh, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Wild Recovery (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to recover using the wild, bestial magic that courses through you. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to regain a number of hit points equal to `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). When you reach 10th level in this class, you regain `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) + your Wisdom modifier instead.

### Shillelagh Mastery (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, when you cast shillelagh, the weapon's damage die becomes a d10, instead of a d8. When you reach 14th level in this class, the damage die becomes a d12.

In addition, while you're wielding a weapon under the effects of shillelagh, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn using that weapon.

### War Druid (Level 10)

At 10th level, when you use your action to cast a druid cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Nature Armor (Level 14)

By 14th level, your connection to nature helps to shield you from harm. At the start of each of your turns, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half your druid level.
