## Class Features

### Master of Fiends (Level 2)

Some individuals are willing to do anything in exchange for power. They delve into forbidden knowledge to expand their command of magic—trafficking with fiends and endangering their immortal soul in exchange for arcane might.

### Wizard Specialty (Level 2)

Beings of the Lower Planes dangle promises of power as bait, hoping to lure careless folk into their clutches. Some of those who take the bait have a keen intellect, enabling them to use careful planning that circumvents this damnation—or at least delays it. In this way, power-hungry mages strike bargains and increase their magical might with the knowledge the fiends offer. A master of fiends, as these individuals are called, is either a diabolist (one who deals with devils) or a demonologist (one who traffics with demons). Most common folk care little about the distinction, seeing both simply as servants of evil, but the differences between the two are significant. Diabolists are masters of language and context, knowing that the contracts proffered by devils are complex and meant to mislead, and must be read carefully and fully understood so as to avoid any trickery. Demons have little use for subtlety; they understand and respect only one thing—power. A demonologist must have the magical power to compel such fiends to do their bidding, or they will surely be rent asunder and have their soul carried screaming back to the Abyss by the demon. Either path takes a person willing to risk their immortal soul in the pursuit of power, and few dare to do so.

### Dark Arts (Level 2)

Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a bonus spell you can copy to your spellbook at half the cost. You gain a new spell at each level indicated on the following list if you have not already learned the spell. You acquire knowledge of these spells through your trafficking with fiends.

When you attain the appropriate wizard level, add the indicated spell to your spellbook: 2nd level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hellish Rebuke.md\|hellish rebuke]]; 4th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Enthrall.md\|enthrall]]; 6th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Nest Of Infernal Vipers (KPDM).md\|nest of infernal vipers]]; 8th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Fiends (KPDM).md\|conjure fiends]]; 10th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Channel Fiendish Power (KPDM).md\|channel fiendish power]]; 12th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Aura Of Wrath (KPDM).md\|aura of wrath]]; 14th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md\|plane shift]]; 16th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dominate Monster.md\|dominate monster]]; and 18th level, [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Imprisonment.md\|imprisonment]].

### Fiendish Presence (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you develop a dark aura of either allure or menace. You gain proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion. You can bring this talent to the fore to gain advantage on a single check using the chosen skill. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Hellbound (Level 2)

Due to your dealings with fiends, your soul is damned, and after your death it is collected by the fiends with whom you bargained. Such creatures do not give up their prizes willingly. Starting when you reach 2nd level, a caster using a spell to return you to life must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. The DC of this save increases by 1 for every five levels you gain hereafter, to a maximum of DC 15 at 17th level. On a successful save, your soul is retrieved and the spell works normally. On a failed save, the spell ends and you remain dead. (The GM can opt to allow either you or the caster trying to revive you to strike a bargain that allows you to be raised. The details of this deal are left up to the GM, but typically such bargaining involves extremely valuable items, magic, and—especially—souls

### Communion at the Crossroads (Level 6)

Tradition states that the devil awaits at the crossroads, looking to bargain with those who seek to sell their souls for glory. When you reach 6th level, you can achieve contact with the lower realms in less dramatic circumstances. For you, any significant liminal space—the threshold between one space and another, such as the edge of a forest, the entrance to a cave, or the doorway leading from a church to its graveyard —will do. In such a place, you can perform a ritual that summons a dark spirit from beyond, a shadowy form that will offer you power for power.

When you do so, you can expend a number of spell slots (equal to your wizard level or lower) in exchange for a pool of an equal number of dice that you can use in one of two ways. You can spend one or more dice as an action on your turn to heal yourself, regaining `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) hit points for every die you spend. Or you can spend one or more dice to boost the damage of a spell you cast. Each die you spend adds an additional die of damage to a spell you cast, of the same size used in the spell (d6s for fireball, for example).

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. Any unused dice in the pool are lost when you rest, and you regain your normal number of spell slots after the rest.

### Planar Defense (Level 10)

When you reach 10th level, you have learned to enhance your magic to provide you with greater benefit against extraplanar threats. You are protected not only against attack or betrayal by fiends, but by celestials that would see you judged for your connection with darkness. You have advantage on any saving throws against spells and abilities of celestials or fiends that would cause you to become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Restrained\|restrained]], [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]], or possessed by such a creature.

Additionally, if you have the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Evil And Good.md\|dispel evil and good]] spell prepared and a celestial or a fiend attacks you, you can cast that spell as a reaction. In addition, if you have a 5th-level spell slot available and a celestial or fiend attacks you, you can expend that spell slot to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Evil And Good.md\|dispel evil and good]] spell as a reaction.

### Master of Dark Conjuration (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, when you cast a magic circle spell that affects fiends, such creatures have disadvantage on any Charisma saving throws made in an attempt to enter or leave the cylinder by teleportation or interplanar travel. In addition, any fiend you summon with a conjuration spell gains 13 temporary hit points.
