## Class Features

### Fey Soul (Level 1)

Your magic comes directly from the plane of fey. Sometimes called mesmers, many with this power pride themselves as masterful bewitchers and illusionists. Your magic probably stems from a powerful fey ancestry or forgotten lineage, but its also possible that it came to you by the will of an archfey or the fey plane itself. Many elves who come into this power become archfeys themselves over time.

### Fey Soul Magic (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write Elvish or Sylvan (your choice). You also learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Fey Soul Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it does not count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an enchantment or illusion spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

### Charming Touch (Level 1)

At 1st level, you can bend the minds of creatures to your will with a simple touch. You gain two of the following Charming Touch options of your choice. You gain another one at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

You can use an action to touch a creature and choose one of the Charming Touch options you know, using your sorcerer spell save DC. You magically know if a creature failed its saving throw against an effect. Any creature that can not be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] succeeds on the saving throw for this feature automatically.

You can use this feature twice at 1st level. You gain additional uses of it when you reach certain levels in this class: 6th level (three uses) and 14th level (four uses). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. In addition, if you have a familiar (such as by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell), you can have it deliver the effect of this feature as if it were you, provided that its touching the target.

The Charming Touch options are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Captivate

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it can only focus on you, ignoring any sights, sounds, or other events in the area to do so. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until you or your companions do anything harmful to it, or until you are more than 10 feet away from it. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on the target.

#### Charm

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, its [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 minute or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

#### Cloak

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it can not perceive you until the end of your next turn. For the duration, it rationalizes anything it witnesses in such a way as to not involve you.

#### Commune

For the next 1 minute, you and the target can communicate as if you shared a common language. The target must be a creature that can speak at least 1 language.

#### Compel

As part of touching the target, you must also give a one-word command. The target then makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, its compelled to follow the command on its next turn, as if by the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Command.md\|command]] spell. When the effect ends, it rationalizes any action it took, provided that it was reasonable. If its obviously not, the creature knows that it was [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] and reacts accordingly.

### Fey Resistance (Level 6)

By 6th level, your fey magic protects you. You have resistance to damage from spells. In addition, you can use an action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed. Once you end an effect in this way, you can not do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Distant Reflection (Level 6)

Also at 6th level, you have learned to project a perfect illusory duplicate of yourself, although it fails to hold up to physical inspection. You can use a bonus action to create this duplicate in an unoccupied space that you can see or in an area that you have previously visited, provided you are no more than 100 miles away from it. The duplicate remains for up to 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).

You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to control the illusion, provided that you can see it. As an action while the duplicate exists you can become deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, but can see and hear as if you were in the illusions space (thereby allowing you to control it from even great distances). You remain deaf and blind in this way until the duplicate ends or until you choose to return to your normal senses (no action required). You can control the illusion as naturally as if it were your own body, moving and speaking as you normally would (although you can not cast spells as if you were in the illusions space). While you can move the illusion, it can not be moved through solid objects or through spaces smaller than your normal form would normally be able to. It also can not be moved more than 60 feet away from the space in which it first appeared.

At 14th level, the range of this feature increases to 1,000 miles, instead of 100, and at 18th level, it can be used from anywhere on the same plane of existence.

You can use your Charming Touch on a target as if you were in the illusions space. In addition, if the illusory duplicate is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to teleport to its space and dispel the illusion.

Once you have used this feature, it can not be used again until you finish a long rest or until you spend 2 sorcery points to use it again as a bonus action.

### Bewildering Rebuke (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, you can twist the minds of creatures that dare attack you. When a hostile creature that you can see hits you or an illusion you made with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to beguile it with your magic. The attacker then takes psychic damage equal to half your sorcerer level, and you can choose to use your Charming Touch feature against it as part of that reaction, expending one of its uses as normal.

In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Charming Touch feature remaining, you regain one use of it.

### Redirect Magic (Level 18)

At 18th level, you can confound and control the magical powers around you. When a target that you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell or creates a magical effect, you can use your reaction to redirect that spell or effect to a different point or target. You learn the original point or target for the spell or effect, as well as what school of magic its from (if any).

You can redirect the spell or effect to a new point or target up to 10 feet away from the original one. You can redirect it even farther in this way by spending sorcery points. For each point you spend, the new point or target can be an additional 10 feet away, up to the spell or effects maximum range.

Once this property has been used, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
