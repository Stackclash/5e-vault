## Class Features

### Void Domain (Level 1)

Few ever catch a glimpse of the cold immensity of the stars and the void, and fewer still are aware of the unfathomable powers that call such places home. Those who see beyond the veil of the mundane often go mad from the irreconcilable clash between their conception of the world and the reality of universal insignificance. To learn what the void has to teach, one must embrace its utter indifference toward life.

### Messenger of the Void (Level 1)

A cleric who adopts the Void domain gains proficiency in [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Intimidation\|Intimidation]].

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 1)

Beginning at 1st level, you are proficient with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Navigators Tools.md\|navigator's tools]].

### Channel Divinity: Hidden Knowledge (Level 2)

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain advantage on Intelligence skill checks. In addition, you can choose to use your Wisdom modifier instead of Intelligence when making these checks. Both effects last for one hour.

### Channel Divinity: Dark Secrets (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to inflict madness on creatures near you. When you present your holy symbol and speak of the void, up to three creatures of your choosing who can see and hear you must make successful Wisdom saving throws or be afflicted with temporary madness (selected randomly from the Short-Term Madness table). An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) cold damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).

### Black Star (Level 17)

At 17th level, you can create crushing gravity in a 60-foot radius circle with you at the center. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. Creatures that start their turn in the area or that enter it during their turn must make a Strength saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature takes `dice:7d6|noform|avg` (`7d6`) bludgeoning damage and is slowed (as the spell) until the start of its next turn. You and up to three creatures you select are immune to the effect.

The gravity lasts for three rounds. All of the effects cease immediately if you move away from the spot you were in when you triggered the effect. After using this ability, you must complete a long rest before using it again.
