## Class Features

### Boreal Bloodline (Level 1)

Your innate magic comes from the power of divine or magical entities of winter, beings born to the ice and cold.

### Sorcerous Origin (Level 1)

You might trace your descent down a line of ancestry from a mighty Sorcerer that bargained with the God of the North Wind for power, or that formed a pact with powerful creatures of ice and snow. Or perhaps you are the first of the bloodline, the product of a union between a parent of your own kind and some wintry being. You might even be the originator of itâ€”the first one to traffic with a powerful boreal being in order to Master the icy might of Winter Magic.

### Numbing Cold (Level 1)

Starting when you choose this Origin at 1st level, your affinity for winter means that your enemies suffer more than normal from the cold spells you cast. A creature that takes cold damage from one of your spells takes extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

### Winter'S Child (Level 1)

Your affinity with winter allows you to venture forth in the cold without harm. You never suffer the effects of Extreme Cold, even if you are not dressed for the weather. Additionally, you can move over snow and ice without taking penalties for Difficult Terrain.

### Gelid Form (Level 6)

At 6th level, you gain resistance to cold damage. Also, when you use Sorcery Points to apply a Metamagic option to a spell that deals cold damage or that produces an effect that involves snow or ice (sleet storm, for example), you can reduce the cost by 1 sorcery point, to a minimum of 1 point.

### Winter'S Form (Level 14)

At 14th level, you can give your wintry power physical form. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to transform your body for 1 minute. When you use this feature, you can take one of two forms:

- Your body transforms into a swirling mass of sleet or snow. Your gear transforms with you or falls to the ground in the space you occupy, as you choose. While in this form, you cannot speak, manipulate objects, attack, or cast spells. You gain immunity to cold damage, resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. In this form, your only method of Movement is a flying speed of 60 feet, and you can hover. You can pass through small holes and narrow openings at least 1 inch in width, but you treat liquids as if they were solid surfaces. You cannot fall, and you remain hovering even while [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]]. You can enter the space of another creature and remain there. Any creature whose space you occupy takes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier.  
- Your body transforms into translucent, blue-white ice, and your hair becomes a crown of snow. You gain immunity to cold damage, resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and vulnerability to fire damage, and your Armor Class is never lower than 15 + your Dexterity modifier. Any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a melee weapon attack or a touch attack takes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier. While in this form, you gain a slam attack with your icy fists that deals `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) bludgeoning damage plus cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier.  

### Winter's Soul (Level 18)

At 18th level, you gain immunity to cold damage and resistance to fire damage. (You don't have this resistance when you use Winter's Form, but you also no longer gain vulnerability to fire damage when you use that feature.) When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, any creature that gets a failure on its saving throw against the spell is also encased in ice, becoming [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] until it or a creature allied with it within 5 feet succeeds on a Strength check against your spell save DC. If the spell does not normally allow a saving throw, the creature makes a saving throw to avoid being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]]. If the spell already causes the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Grappled\|grappled]] condition, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.
