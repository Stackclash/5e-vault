## Class Features

### Magi-Zoologist (Level 2)

While most arcane colleges are more concerned with the intellectual study of esoteric and sometimes only theoretical origins of magic, there exists one that prefers to focus only on what they can see around them in the natural world: the magi-zoologists. This school of thought believes that the greatest source of information about magic is to be found in the many magical creatures that exist in the world, each one brimming with arcane secrets to be unlocked through research and study. Through their travels, the magi-zoologists collect samples of the various monsters in the multiverse, applying the lessons they learn into new breakthroughs in both spellwork and science.

While they are often derided by even other wizard schools as lacking imagination, the best magi-zoologists are extremely pragmatic and are well-equipped to survive the many dangers of the world. After all, it takes true strength to face down a full-grown dragon and live to autopsy its corpse.

### Harvest Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, when you make a "Harvest" check on a non-humanoid creature that has the *innate spellcasting* feature and your roll equals or exceeds that creature's challenge rating, you may pick one spell from that creature's *innate spellcasting* feature and add it to your list of prepared spells that day. This spell does not count towards the number of spells you have prepared that day. When you cast that spell, it is considered a wizard spell for you and you still need to fulfill all component and spell slot requirements when casting it. You retain the ability to cast that spell until you finish your next long rest, at which point it vanishes from your memory.

If the spell you harvested is a wizard spell of 1st level or higher and is of a level for which you have spell slots, you can add it to your spellbook before it vanishes from your memory. To do so, you follow the same rules as normally copying a spell into your spellbook. You must copy the full spell before it vanishes from your memory. If you do not, any resources you have already contributed to copying the spell are wasted.

### Anatomical Study (Level 2)

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled when you make "Appraise" checks. In addition, you have advantage on any ability check made to recall information about the biology and behaviour of non-humanoid creatures.

### Firsthand Experience (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, if you are subjected to a saving throw imposed by the ability or feature of a non-humanoid, non-beast creature, you may add your Intelligence modifier as a bonus to any future saving throws imposed by subsequent uses of that ability or feature. You retain this benefit until you finish your next long rest.

### Monster Tamer (Level 10)

At 10th level, your study of the behaviour of creatures allows you to weave magic into your words, allowing you to placate and calm them. You add the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Monster (XGE).md\|charm monster]] spell [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: (Xanathars Guide to Everything)] to your spellbook if you did not already know it, and you always have it prepared; having it prepared in this way does not count towards your total amount of spells prepared for that day. In addition, if you cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Monster (XGE).md\|charm monster]] on a creature with an Intelligence score lower than yours, they have disadvantage on the saving throw to resist the effect.

### Counter-Ability (Level 14)

At 14th level, you learn to break the magic bonds that permeate the bodies of magical creatures, temporarily disrupting their abilities. Whenever a non-humanoid, non-beast creature within 30 feet of you that you can see attempts to use an ability or feature that would force another creature to make a saving throw, you may use your reaction to cause it to fail and have no effect. This feature cannot be used on abilities in which the saving throw is imposed by a weapon attack.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses once you finish a long rest.
