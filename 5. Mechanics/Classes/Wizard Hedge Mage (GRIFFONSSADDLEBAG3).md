## Class Features

### Hedge Mage (Level 2)

Hedge mages, sometimes called hedge witches, are curious wizards typically hidden on the outskirts of villages or strange forests. These wizards practice natural magic, not unlike a druid or ranger, but do so through rigorous study of botany and herbology. By using this knowledge, hedge mages can create masterful spells and valuable elixirs using the natural world around them.

### Nature Savant (Level 2)

When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, the following druid spells are added to the wizard spell list for you. At the GMs discretion, other similar beast or plant-related spells from the druid spell list can be added to this expanded spell list. The gold and time you must spend to copy one of these spells into your spellbook is halved.

In addition, you gain proficiency with the herbalism kit. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with the poisoners kit or one type of artisans tools of your choice.

### Animate Plant (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use an action to touch a Medium or smaller plant to animate it, transforming the plant into a plant creature with a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower for 1 hour. The GM chooses statistics appropriate for the plant, such as an awakened shrub. The plant is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any mental command that you issue to it (no action required by you). In combat, the plant shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. If you do not issue any commands, the plant defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The effect ends early if the plant drops to 0 hit points. When you reach 6th level in this class, the plant creature can have a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower, or 1 or lower when you reach 10th level.

You share a telepathic link with the animated plant. Through this link, it can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you. Additionally, as an action, you can see through the plants eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the plant has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Elixirs (Level 6)

By 6th level, your keen knowledge of herbology and arcane wit allow you to craft certain natural, but distinctly magical, elixirs. You know three elixir recipes, but can choose to replace a known elixir recipe for a different one whenever you finish a long rest. Your elixir recipe options are detailed at the end of this arcane tradition. You create an elixir by combining the recipes ingredients together in an empty flask or vial and speaking its unique command phrase. The ingredients and command phrase required for an elixir are listed in its description. Ingredients are consumed as part of making a potion, but are typically included in the materials you collect as part of filling your component pouch.

A creature can drink an elixir or administer one to another creature as an action. Alternatively, you can use an action to throw an elixir at a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature is willing, it magically gains the effects of the thrown elixir. If the creature is unwilling, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be affected by the elixir.

You can create a number of elixirs equal to your proficiency bonus using this feature. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses of this feature, and any unused elixirs become nonmagical. You can create an elixir with 2 minutes of work, or you can use your natural magic to bridge the gap between herbology and alchemy. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher from your expanded spell list, you can expend a use of this feature to create an elixir from your known recipes, provided you have the materials to do so. When you do, the elixir appears in a free hand or at your feet (your choice).

### Elixir Recipies (Level 6)

- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elixir Of Charm (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|Elixir of Charm]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elixir Of Night (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|Elixir of Night]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elixir Of Protection (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|Elixir of Protection]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elixir Of Recovery (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|Elixir of Recovery]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elixir Of Restoration (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|Elixir of Restoration]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elixir Of Truth (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|Elixir of Truth]]  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Elixir Of Witchfire (GRIFFONSSADDLEBAG3).md\|Elixir of Witchfire]]  

### Forest Sage (Level 10)

By 10th level, you can cast the speak with plants spell as a ritual. In addition, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the hit points restored and the damage dealt or reduced by your elixirs.

### Animate Major Plant (Level 14)

At 14th level, you can use an action to expend two uses of your Animate Plant feature to touch a Large or Huge tree, or similar plant, to turn it into an awakened tree. The plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a humans. Alternatively, you can use an action to magically grow a Large awakened tree from the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you instead. In either case, the plant is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] by you for 1 hour or until you use a bonus action to end it. The plant shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours, and obeys any verbal command that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you do not issue any commands, the plant defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.

When the charm ends, the plant becomes inanimate once more. If you used an action to grow the awakened tree, it rapidly decomposes into a small pile of fertile soil at the end of the duration instead.

In addition, a plant that is animated by this feature or your Animate Plants feature also gains the following benefits:

- Its speed is doubled, up to a maximum of 30 feet.  
- It gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and Strength checks equal to your Intelligence modifier.  
- Its hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your wizard level.
