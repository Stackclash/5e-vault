# Skin Wearer
*[[Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]]: Sorcerous Origin*  
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 116*  


## Class Features

### Skin Wearer (Level 1)

It's a tale almost as old as civilisation; the story of a shapeshifting creature that take other forms and parents a child with a regular humanoid. Whether this union was happy or not, the resulting child has a chance to become a Skin Wearer. Like their transforming parents, Skin Wearers have an inherently malleable form and are particularly adept at transmutation and illusion magic. In order to stabilise themselves, Skin Wearers often garb themselves in pelts, hides, and skins of other creatures, adding the strength of the harvested creature to their own magic.

### Embody Creature (Level 1)

When you choose this origin at 1st level, you gain the ability to partly transform yourself into other creatures by wearing their skin, hide, or pelts, empowering your own abilities in the process. While wearing an item made from the skin, hide, or pelt of a beast or monstrosity, you may spend your action to embody that creature and gain one of the following benefits of your choice for the next 10 minutes or until you end this effect early as a bonus action:

- You gain any saving throw proficiencies that creature may have had.  
- You gain any senses that creature may have had.  
- You gain any damage resistances and immunities that creature may have had.  

Once you have used this ability once, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Skin Walker (Level 1)

At 1st level, whenever you attempt to "harvest" a creature's skin, hide, or pelt, the DC of those items are lowered to 10 if they were higher than that originally. In addition, your affinity for donning the form of others also helps you mask your true intentions, granting you proficiency in Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]]) checks.

### Malleable Form (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, your malleable form makes transmutation and illusion magic cast on you effortless. Whenever you use a spell slot to cast either a transmutation spell on yourself or an illusion spell that changes your appearance, roll a `dice: d20|avg` (`d20`). If you roll a number lower than your sorcerer level, the spell slot you used is instantly restored.

### Full Embodiment (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, you learn to exert greater control over your skin wearing, allowing you to fully embody your harvested creature's abilities. While embodying a creature, in addition to your chosen benefit, you may also choose to change your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores to match that creature's. If your Constitution modifier increases as a result of this, your maximum hit points increase but your current hit points do not.

### Shapeshifter Supreme (Level 18)

At 18th level, you are able to cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shapechange.md\|shapechange]] spell without expending a spell slot. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. You may also attempt to use your [Malleable Form](compendium/classes/sorcerer-skin-wearer-hhhviii.md#Malleable%20Form%20(Level%206)) feature to restore use of this feature immediately after casting the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Shapechange.md\|shapechange]] spell, following the same rules as you would for restoring a spell slot.
