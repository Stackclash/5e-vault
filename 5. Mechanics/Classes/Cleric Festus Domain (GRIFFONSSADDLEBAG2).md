## Class Features

### Festus Domain (Level 1)

Gods of eating and drinking, such as Daghdha or Dionysus, promote the value of a good meal as much as they do the joy of sharing it with friends. As a follower of this domain, you believe that a good feast can be enough to settle most wars. You may know this first-hand: perhaps your life has been marred by poverty and survival with spoiled scraps, or maybe you've been blessed with lovingly-cooked meals and the joy of a full stomach. Regardless of your origins, you recognize the magic of a good meal and the power it has on a person's spirit and well-being.

Through your passion and devotion, you see mealtime as a joyous way to worship the magic of food and your chosen deity. You are a capable chef with an appreciation of all food, both good and bad. You know that a foul meal can turn even the most veteran of stomachs against themselves, and have learned to harness this power for yourself. Like food, most people will like you at your best, but everyone will fear you at your worst.

### Festus Domain Spells (Level 1)

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Festus Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor, martial weapons, [[5. Mechanics/Items/Brewers Supplies.md\|brewer's supplies]], and [[5. Mechanics/Items/Cooks Utensils.md\|cook's utensils]].

### Table-Turner (Level 1)

At 1st level, you can cause an attacker's own body to turn against itself. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice:1d12|noform|avg` (`1d12`) poison damage and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful one, it takes half as much poison damage and isn't [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Create Healing Draft (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity as an action to create a small and magically concentrated potion called a healing draft. The potion appears in a small glass bottle in your free hand or at your feet (your choice), and is a deep blue color with flecks of gold. A creature that uses a bonus action to drink this potion regains a number of hit points equal to `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) + your cleric level. The bottle and any undrunk healing draft turns to dust and is lost when you finish a short or long rest.

### Strong Stomach (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, your divinity and magically enhanced constitution have strengthened your natural defenses. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to acid and poison damage.

In addition, whenever you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Create Food And Water.md\|create food and water]] spell, the food tastes delicious, and you can choose to replace up to 5 gallons of the water created by the spell with ale or wine. You choose what the food and ale or wine look and taste like.

Finally, if you're drunk or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]], you can use an action to magically suppress the effect for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) acid or poison damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).

### Invigorating Feast (Level 17)

At 17th level, you can say a special prayer before eating a meal to enchant it and other food of your choice within 30 feet of you with unique protections. A creature that eats this enchanted food over the next 10 minutes gains `dice:2d6+10|noform|avg` (`2d6 + 10`) temporary hit points, is immune to being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]], and can't be put to sleep by magic. These benefits last for 8 hours and don't set in until these 10 minutes are over. You and up to six other willing creatures of your choice gain these benefits by partaking in the meal.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
