## Class Features

### Meteor Knight (Level 3)

Meteor knights can exercise a limited degree of control over the gravity around them. These fighters command a growing collection of missiles and other debris that float around them, using it to mercilessly pelt targets beyond their reach or launch veritable hailstorms of meteorites. While a meteor knights abilities are magical in nature, such powers are often manifested from a connection to the astral sea rather than from arcane study. Knights of the highest order, or those who fill the role of leader in their community, may sometimes be referred to as Lode Stars.

### Satellite Mastery (Level 3)

Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you can magically bind a number of missiles to you up to your proficiency bonus. You can bind a missile, such as a dart, sling bullet, crossbow bolt, or similar object to you using an action. You must be touching the object to bind it. If you bind another missile when you already have the maximum number bound to you, a different missile of your choice ceases to be bound. A bound missile is called a satellite.

You can mentally command any number of satellites to hover and orbit around your body or drop into your hand, quiver, or similar container. Doing so can be done in place of drawing or stowing a weapon.

While you have at least one satellite orbiting you, you can use a bonus action to make a ranged spell attack with it, sending it magically hurtling toward a target that you can see within 30 feet of you. Intelligence is your ability modifier for this attack, and you are proficient with it. On a hit, the satellite deals bludgeoning or piercing damage (depending on the shape of the missile) equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with this feature. When you reach 10th level in this class, the range of this spell attack increases to 60 feet.

You can use an action to cause all satellites within 120 feet of you to return to you, flying back into your orbit or into your open hand or similar container you are carrying (your choice).

The damage of your satellites increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 10th level (1d6) and 18th level (1d8).

### Reduce Gravity (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, you can cause the pull of gravity on you to lessen. You learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Jump.md\|jump]] spells. At 10th level in this class, you also learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Levitate.md\|levitate]] spell. When you cast one of these spells, you can target only yourself, and the spell does not require material components. You can cast each of these spells once with this feature, and once you cast a spell in this way, you can not do so again until you finish a long rest.

When you reach 15th level in this class, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md\|feather fall]] and [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Jump.md\|jump]] spells at will. The spells must still target only yourself.

### Course Correct (Level 7)

Starting at 7th level, your control over your bound missiles can be exerted over others that come near you. When a launched missile that you can see (and is light enough to be a satellite for you) comes within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to attempt to alter its course or ensnare it. Make a contested Intelligence check against the original attack roll, adding your proficiency bonus to the check. On a success, you can choose a new target for the attack within 10 feet of the original one, using the original attack roll to determine whether or not it hits the new target. Alternatively, on a success, you can cause the missile to become a satellite for you, ending your bond to another satellite if necessary.

### Improved Satellite Mastery (Level 10)

At 10th level, you can return a satellite to your orbit when it misses its mark. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a ranged spell attack roll using a satellite, you can cause it to immediately fly back and return to your orbit (no action required).

In addition, all satellites within 120 feet of you return to your orbit when you use your Action Surge. They return to your orbit either before or after the additional action.

### Increase Gravity (Level 15)

By 15th level, you have learned how to briefly adjust the way that gravity affects you, increasing your sturdiness and reducing that of your enemies. You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to resist being pushed, pulled, or knocked [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Prone\|prone]].

In addition, when you shove a creature, you can also add your Intelligence modifier to the ability check.

### Satellite Barrage (Level 18)

At 18th level, you can send a simultaneous bombardment of your orbiting satellites. Once on your turn, you can use an action to make any number of ranged spell attacks with your satellites, up to the number of orbiting ones you have.
