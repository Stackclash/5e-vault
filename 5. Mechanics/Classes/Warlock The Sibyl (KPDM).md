## Class Features

### The Sibyl (Level 1)

You have made a pact with the Sibyl, a divine being associated with prophecy, knowledge, and fate. Your patron guides you through visions, portents, and periods of ecstatic clarity to act on its behalf and to further its stratagems. Your relationship to your patron is different from that of its clergy. You are not asked for faith, worship, or adulation; instead, you serve solely through your action and influence in the world. Because of that, you might have a strained relationship with the deity's most dedicated priests and other zealots.

Except as noted below, you function as a warlock and use the warlock spell list.

### Expanded Spell List (Level 1)

The Sibyl lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

**The Sibyl Expanded Spells**

| Spell Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| 1st | [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Alarm.md\|alarm]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Seers Reaction (KPDM).md\|seer's reaction]] |
| 2nd | [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Augury.md\|augury]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Blindness Deafness.md\|blindness/deafness]] |
| 3rd | [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bestow Curse.md\|bestow curse]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Clairvoyance.md\|clairvoyance]] |

| 5th | [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Eidetic Memory (KPDM).md\|eidetic memory]], [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Legend Lore.md\|legend lore]] |

### Touched by the Sibyl (Level 1)

At 1st level, you are driven to ecstatic gibbering and utterances through your connection to your patron. Your prophetic commentary, startling insights, and frenetic appearance is unsettling, distracting, and psychically damaging to your target. Although the manifestation is different, this functions identically to the vicious mockery cantrip.

Additionally, you are proficient at Performance. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for ability checks you make using Performance.

### Disastrous Prognostication (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you can direct your patron to infiltrate and overwhelm your target's psyche with prophetic knowledge of failures from the target's immediate future. As an action, target a creature that can see and hear you within 60 feet. It must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of your next turn.

After using this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Whispered Warnings (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, the sibylline voices in your mind become clearer and more focused. The voices bolster your mindfulness of your surroundings and grant you a preternatural awareness of creatures that mean you harm. While wearing light or no armor, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to your armor class.

### Pierce the Veil (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, when you inflict psychic damage to a target, you can also inundate it with frenetic and discordant voices of doom. The awful truths revealed to the target cause `dice:8d10|noform|avg` (`8d10`) psychic damage and it is confused (as the spell) until the end of its next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
