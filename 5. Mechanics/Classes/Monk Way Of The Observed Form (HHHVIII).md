## Class Features

### Way of the Observed Form (Level 3)

Monks of the Way of the Observed Form follow the belief that the best style of combat is to have no style at all. Instead, their belief is that one should learn from their opponents, adapt their methods, and then throw them back at them with deadly results. These monks are known to be almost impossible to predict on the battlefield, possessing as many techniques as there are creatures in the world.

As part of their emphasis on observing and adapting to one's opponent, these monks tend to have a keen interest in biology and anatomy. They use their keen senses to study the bodies of others and are often able to pick out the minutest detail in a creature's bone or muscle movement. These traits make these monks renowned as warriorscholars that are sought out as much for their knowledge as they are for their martial ability.

### Mirrored Stance (Level 3)

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to observe your opponents through battle and adopt their strengths into your fighting style. As a bonus action, you may expend 1 ki point to focus on a hostile creature you can see within 60 feet of you. If you do so, you learn their creature type and you adopt one of the stances below based on that type. You remain in this stance for 1 minute ending it early if you are incapacitated, if you use this feature again, or if you end it as a free action.

### Observant Fist (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, you learn to study your opponent through combat. Whenever you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you may spend 1 ki point to gain the benefits of a successful "Appraise" check on that creature as well as learning that creature's Armor Class, current hit points, and any damage resistances and immunities they may have.

### Adaptive Defence (Level 11)

Starting at 11th level, you are able to adapt quickly to your opponent's attacks, allowing you to mitigate potential harm that comes your way. Whenever you are hit by a spell or weapon attack, you may use your reaction to spend 2 ki points and gain resistance to all damage types inflicted by that attack until the start of your next turn.

### Hybrid Stance (Level 17)

At 17th level you learn how to weave your stances together into greater and more powerful combinations. When you enter a stance, you may choose to spend up to 2 additional ki points in order to gain the benefits of the same number of additional stances of your choice. You retain these benefits so long as you remain in the original stance.
