## Class Features

### Chain Domain (Level 1)

In the sacred bonds between the divine and mortal realms, there exist enigmatic clerics pledged to serve deities of typically evil influence. Among them, the Chain Domain clerics stand as devoted mediators, seeking to harness or redirect the selfish whims of their deity in unconventional ways. These clerics perceive themselves as intermediaries, embracing chains as tools for guidance, understanding, and, at times, restraint. They aim to navigate the tumultuous relationship with their enigmatic deity, weaving the chains as symbols of both connection and potential liberation, in pursuit of channeling their deity's influence toward a tempered purpose.

Many of these clerics are considered intense by outsiders, and they may even be reformed cultists or regularly engage in fiendish contracts. And, while pious self-flagellation is never a requirement among clerics of this domain, it is nevertheless a common practice.

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Chain Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with flails and whips, as well as ring mail and chain mail.

### Repentant Chains (Level 1)

Also at 1st level, whenever you make an ability check or saving throw to escape or resist being grappled or restrained, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.

Whenever you hit a target with a weapon attack, you can immediately use a bonus action to cause divine chains to wrap around the target. That target must make a Strength saving throw against your cleric spell save DC or become grappled by the chains until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Bind the Faithless (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bind your foes with divine power.

As a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and conjure spectral chains that wrap around a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the chains for 1 minute or until you end the effect (no action required). At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Righteous Flagellation (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn and hit a grappled or restrained creature, you can immediately make an additional attack against the target as part of the same action. Alternatively, if you grapple a creature using your Repentant Chains feature, you can immediately make this additional attack against the target as part of the bonus action to use that feature. You don't gain these benefits if you already have the Extra Attack feature.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Chains of Damnation (Level 17)

At 17th level, any weapon you're holding has the reach property, as divine chains lengthen or stretch the weapon with each attack. This version of the reach property adds 15 feet to your normal reach, instead of 5. If you make an attack against a grappled creature, you have advantage on the attack roll.

Whenever a creature fails the saving throw against either your Repentant Chains or Bind the Faithless feature, that creature immediately takes bludgeoning damage from the chains equal to half your cleric level.
