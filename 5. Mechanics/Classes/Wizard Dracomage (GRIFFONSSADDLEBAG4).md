## Class Features

### Dracomage (Level 2)

Wizards that devote their studies to the ancient and formidable power of dragons are called Dracomages. By channeling their spellcasting to fuel draconic abilities, Dracomages emulate and harness the power of dragons with a fury that few can withstand. With an air of both reverence and ambition, Dracomages strive to embody the power and majesty of these mythical beings, all while carving out their own legend in the annals of magic.

### Dragon Lore (Level 2)

Beginning at 2nd level, you can speak, read, and write Draconic—a testament to your time spent researching dragon lore; if you already know Draconic, you instead learn another language of your choice. In addition, you have advantage on any Intelligence check you make to recall draconic lore or comprehend magic from dragons, as well as any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain concentration on a spell that has either "Draconic" or "Dragon" in its name.

Furthermore, if you cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell, the summoned familiar can take the form of a pseudodragon.

### Dragon Dice (Level 2)

Also at 2nd level, you learn to store a portion of your magic whenever you cast certain spells. This stored magic manifests as a pool of dice, called dragon dice, which are d6s. The maximum number of dragon dice you can have at a time is equal to twice your proficiency bonus. If you finish a short or long rest and have fewer dragon dice than your Intelligence modifier, you gain a number of dice up to that amount.

You gain additional dragon dice whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage. The number of dice you gain is equal to the level of the spell, up to your maximum amount.

While you have these dice, you can use an action to unleash a draconic breath attack, which originates from anywhere you choose on your person, such as your mouth or from the end of a staff. The breath is either a 15-foot cone or 30-foot line that's 5 feet wide (your choice each time). Each creature within the breath's area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. Choose a number of dragon dice to roll for the breath, up to the number you have; an affected creature takes the rolled amount of damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You choose the breath's damage type each time:

acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

You lose any dragon dice you have whenever you finish a long rest (before gaining a number equal to your Intelligence modifier).

### Mighty Breath (Level 6)

At 6th level, the power of your draconic breath can create a secondary effect based on the breath's damage type. You can choose the breath's damage type after rolling the dragon dice.

- **Acid.** For each 6 you roll on the dragon dice, affected creatures that fail their saving throw also take a −1 penalty to AC until the end of your next turn.  
- **Cold.** Affected creatures that fail their saving throw also have their speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.  
- **Fire.** For each 6 you roll on the dragon dice, roll another d6 and add it to the total fire damage dealt by the breath.  
- **Lightning.** Affected creatures can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.  
- **Poison.** For each 6 you roll on the dragon dice, choose an affected creature that failed its saving throw: that creature deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of it whenever you finish a short or long rest.  

### Arcane Resilience (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, when you're subjected to an effect that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison and allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Draconic Summon (Level 14)

By 14th level, you can use a bonus action to conjure forth the visage of a Large dragon, which is obviously illusory. The dragon lasts for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). It also ends early if it's ever more than 120 feet away from you. The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you.

When you summon the dragon, and again as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move it up to 30 feet and command it to use one of the following options. Each option requires you to expend a number of dragon dice, as specified below.

- **Bite or Claws (1 dragon die).** The dragon bites or lashes out with its spectral claws. Make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier.  
- **Dragon's Breath (1 or more dragon dice).** The dragon unleashes your draconic breath from its mouth, as if you were in its space.  
- **Terrifying Roar (3 dragon dice).** The dragon lets out a powerful roar that frightens nearby creatures. Each hostile creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the dragon until the start of your next turn. A creature that can't hear is immune to this effect.  
- **Wing Attack (2 dragon dice).** The dragon beats its wings to create a powerful gust of wind originating from it in a 15foot cone. Each creature within the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and branding smiteed prone.  

The dragon uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus for these options. When you move the dragon, you can move it up to an additional 30 feet by expending 1 dragon die.

Whenever you expend 1 or more dragon dice to command or move the dragon, the dragon also exudes an instantaneous aura of bravery: each friendly creature within 15 feet of the dragon when you expend the dragon dice has advantage on saving throws against being frightened until the start of your next turn.
