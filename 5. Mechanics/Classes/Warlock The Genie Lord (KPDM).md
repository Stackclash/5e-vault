## Class Features

### The Genie Lord (Level 1)

You have made a pact with a powerful ruler of genie kind on one of the Elemental Planes. The genie lords' aims swing wildly from inscrutable by mortal minds to startlingly simple and innocuous. Genie lords struggle endlessly to one-up each other, and rivalries between these elemental rulers can engulf entire nations. If they think it will gain them an advantage, genie lords aren't above bribing a rival's mortal agents to switch sides.

Genie Lords include: Astallah, djinni Calipha of the Bright Wind from the Plane of Air; Ghorek, dao Khan of the Onyx Depths on the Plane of Earth; Ixingaltrix, efreeti Emir and Keeper of the Molten Tower on the Plane of Fire; and Saliandla, marid Pasha of the Pearl Fane from the Plane of Water.

### Expanded Spell List (Level 1)

The Genie Lord lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. You can choose an elemental magic spell when you learn a new spell. For you, the following spells are added to the warlock spell list.

### Genie Lord's Favor (Level 1)

At 1st level you can speak, read, and write Primordial. You understand and can be understood by any creature that speaks Auran, Ignan, Terran, or Aquan.

Additionally, your patron grants you a token that can absorb elemental power. You gain a magical gemstone with the following properties:

- You can use the gem as an arcane focus.  
- The gem can capture and store elemental power. When you take acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage, you can choose to transfer some of the damage into the gem instead of taking the damage yourself. The gem's maximum capacity for damage equals twice your warlock level plus your Charisma modifier. The gem drains of energy and becomes empty again when you complete a long rest.  
- While the gem stores any amount of elemental power, you can use an action to cause it to shed bright light out to 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet, to shed dim light out to 5 feet, or to douse the light.  

If you lose your token, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous token. When you die, the token splinters to slivers.

### Release Energy (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you can use the elemental energy stored in your gem token against foes. When you damage a target with a spell or attack, you can spend stored points to deal additional damage of a type stored in the gem equal to your Charisma bonus. If you deal damage to multiple targets with a single source, choose which one takes the extra elemental damage.

Additionally, you can extend the protection of your gem to other creatures. When an ally within 30 feet that you can see takes damage as described above, you can use your reaction to transfer some of the damage into your gem.

### Minor Wish (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, you can call upon your genie lord to twist fate in your favor. Immediately after you make an attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or damage roll, you can choose to reroll and take the better result.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Herald's Aspect (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of your patron into your flesh to magically transform into a herald of your Genie Lord. Your legs fade away into a swirl of elemental energy, and your skin and features take on a cast that resembles that of your patron. You can transform as a bonus action and the transformation lasts for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.  
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  
- Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder. You gain immunity to that damage type.  
- Once on your turn when you hit with an attack or spell, you can deal an extra `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) damage of one of the following types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.  

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
