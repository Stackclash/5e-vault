## Class Features

### Order of the Spellforge (Level 2)

Wizards who have studied the bonds between metal and magic may belong to the Order of the Spellforge, a group long lauded as the creators of famed dancing swords. These spellcasters are no strangers to the crucibles of war, having studied book and blade in equal part, and call upon the aid of their own metallic familiars as steadfast companions. Eschewing dusty libraries for the flames of forges and battle, wizards of this tradition wield both sword and scepter to create an unassailable pairing of might and magic.

### War Machinist (Level 2)

Beginning when you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with longswords and shortswords. You also gain proficiency with smiths tools and tinkers tools, and if you do not already have the Rock Gnomes Tinker racial trait, you gain it.

### Construct Familiar (Level 2)

Also at 2nd level, you always have the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md\|find familiar]] spell prepared, which does not count against the total number of spells you can prepare each day. Furthermore, you can choose to cast the spell without expending a spell slot or material components. When you do, the casting time is 1 minute (instead of 1 hour); the familiar is a construct made of metal, which is immune to poison damage and can not be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]]. In combat, it takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can mentally command the familiar where to move (no action required by you). 

When you cast find familiar in this way, you can choose to have the familiars spirit inhabit one of your Tiny clockwork devices from your Tinker trait, although it does not gain any special properties in doing so; you must be holding the device, and dismantling it ends the spell. Alternatively, you can have the spirit inhabit a nonmagical sword that you are holding, using the statistics for a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Construct/Flying Sword.md\|flying sword]]. The sword can occupy another creatures space and vice versa.

While your construct familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher as a bonus action to grant it more autonomy. For the next minute, the familiar gains the following benefits:

- You can use a bonus action to command the familiar to take the Attack action on its turn, which can be done as part of the bonus action to expend the spell slot.  
- The familiar is immune to damage, but is still susceptible to antimagic field and dispel magic.  
- For every two slot levels above 1st, the familiars weapon attacks deal 1 extra damage die on a hit. This dies damage type can be the same as the weapons, or it can be cold, fire, or lightning (your choice).  

The effects end early if the familiar ends its turn more than 100 feet away from you.

> [!note] Variant: Unique Weapon Proficiencies
> 
> Not all wizards of this order have studied the blade: many dwarven mages specialize in hammers as part of this order, and the deep gnomes of Mirrorlight caverns have a preference for war picks. When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you can choose to gain proficiency in two weapons other than swords. To be eligible, the weapon must be a melee weapon, and it can not have the heavy property. In combat, the flying familiar deals damage relevant to the chosen weapon, but the damage dice used for any features using the weapon remain unchanged. Regardless of what weapons you choose, when a feature references the sword, it applies to your chosen weapons.

### Faraway Blade (Level 6)

At 6th level, you can use an action to slash the air in front of you with a sword you are holding to make a ranged spell attack with it against a target that you can see within 60 feet of you, using your wizard spell attack bonus. The target gains no benefit from cover against this attack. If the sword grants a bonus to attack or damage rolls made with it, such as a +1 longsword, those bonuses also apply to this spell attack; if something else would normally grant you a bonus to your spell attacks, you choose which bonus to use. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 2d8 + your Intelligence modifier. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 11th level (3d8) and 17th level (4d8).

Alternatively, if you cast a spell that requires you to make a melee weapon attack as part of casting it, you can choose to allow your flying sword familiar to deliver the attack against a target within 5 feet of it instead.

### Razor Wit (Level 6)

Also at 6th level, you can use a sword as an arcane focus for your wizard spells. When you use a sword to make a melee attack, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage roll.

In addition, your flying sword familiar uses your proficiency bonus, and it adds your Intelligence modifier to its attack and damage rolls, instead of its Strength. The familiars weapon attacks are also considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

### Guardian Amulet (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, you can create a magical amulet. To do so, you must spend 8 hours of work transforming an amulet worth at least 100 gp.

You gain special benefits while wearing the amulet. Constructs have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you while you wear it. You can also use an action to gain an additional benefit from it, which lasts until you finish a short or long rest or until you die. The options you can choose for this benefit are listed below. You can not use the feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

- You are immune to poison damage and can not be diseased or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].  
- You have advantage on saving throws against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]].  
- You have blindsight out to a range of 30 feet.  
- You do not need to breathe.  

If another creature is wearing the amulet, constructs have disadvantage on attack rolls against that creature, but it gains no other benefits from wearing the amulet. If you create a new amulet, the previous one ceases to function.

### Spell Storing (Level 14)

By 14th level, you can store one spell of 5th level or lower in your construct familiar. To do so, you must cast a spell on the familiar, which must have a casting time of 1 action or bonus action and can not require concentration. The spell has no effect but is stored within the familiar. At your command, the familiar casts the stored spell using its action or bonus action (as determined by the spells casting time) and requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost. A stored spell is also lost if the familiar is reduced to 0 hit points or permanently dismissed.
