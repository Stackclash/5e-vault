## Class Features

### Elementalist (Level 2)

You concentrate your arcane studies on the power inherent to one of the Elemental Planes.

### Wizard Speciality (Level 2)

Elementalists believe in the superiority of their chosen element above all others, and they aren't shy about making that fact known. Elementalists are sometimes secluded researchers, but more often they're adventurous types who sign on with groups that can appreciate their singular talents.

### Elemental Savant (Level 2)

Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, choose one element from the table below. That element becomes the focus of your study. You can speak, read, and write the language associated with your focus element, and the associated damage type is used by other features as noted.

**Elemental Focus**

| Element | Language | Damage Type |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Air | Primordial | Lightning or thunder (choose one) |
| Earth | Primordial | Acid |
| Fire | Primordial | Fire |
| Water | Primordial | Cold |
^elemental-focus

Some spells are associated with your focus element. The gold and time you must spend to copy a spell associated with your chosen element into your spellbook is halved. The spell list for each focus element is given below. Spells marked with an asterisk appear in this book.

### Elemental Mastery (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you learn magical techniques, called masteries, to channel elemental magic into your being and spells.

#### Masteries
_Source: Deep Magic_

You learn two [[5. Mechanics/Lists/List Optfeaturetype Mastery.md\|masteries]] of your choice. You learn one additional mastery of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Each time you learn a new mastery, you can also replace one mastery you know with a different one.

### Substitute Elements (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, you can funnel elemental essence through your damage-dealing spells. When you cast a spell that does damage, you can change the damage to the type associated with your focus elemental.

### Absorb Elements (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage of the type associated with your elemental focus, you can use a reaction to take no damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken.

You can use this ability even if you have resistance or immunity to that damage type from another source. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Irresistible Strike (Level 14)

At 14th level, your elemental damage spells are unstoppable. Your spells that deal damage of the type associated with your elemental focus ignore immunity to that damage type.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
