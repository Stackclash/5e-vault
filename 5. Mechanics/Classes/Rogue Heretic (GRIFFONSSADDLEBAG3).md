## Class Features

### Heretic (Level 3)

You are inspired to lead change by divine force. Regardless of any personal oaths or beliefs you carry, your deep conviction to a greater purpose provides you with a limited scope of divine power. You are tethered to the will of multiple deities, instead of one, and in doing so can call on their versatile strengths to aid your work. As an arbiter of the greater will of the divine, you are always capable of reaching and beseeching a deity to aid in your endeavors, especially if doing so also disrupts the interests of a competing power. These deities willing to lend their strength to you also accept that your expert hand moves by the grace of all deities, not just theirs, and understand that your actions may not always be congruent with their motivations. Sometimes called white wolves among the devout for being independent and outspoken, Heretics are by all means wolves in sheeps' clothing.

### Guise of the Devout (Level 3)

Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, maces have the finesse property for you. In addition, whenever you make an Intelligence (Religion) check to recall information about a religion or deity, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

When you reach 11th level in this class, your Reliable Talent feature also affects any Intelligence (Religion) check you make, even if you are not proficient with the skill.

### Heretic's Curse (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to place a baneful curse on a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. This curse lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. For the duration, whenever the cursed creature makes a saving throw against a cleric spell you cast, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. In addition, you can use your Sneak Attack against the cursed creature even if you do not have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it. When you do, you can choose for the Sneak Attack damage to be radiant.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. You can use it three times between rests when you reach 9th level in this class, and four times at 13th level.

### Spellcasting (Level 3)

When you reach 3rd level, you gain enough divine favor to cast a limited variety of spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell list.

#### Cantrips

You learn three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

#### Spell Slots

The Heretic Spellcasting table below shows how many spell slots you have to cast cleric spells of 1st through 4th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your cleric spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended Heretic spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach 13th level in this class, you gain a special spell slot, in addition to your normal ones. This spell slot is the same spell level as your other Heretic spell slots, but is only regained when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

When you gain this feature, choose a Divine Domain from the cleric class. Until you finish a long rest, the cleric spells you know are the ones listed in that domain's spell list, provided that you have the spell slots with which to cast them. You can choose the same or a different domain whenever you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are 13th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. If you chose the Life domain, you must spend one of those slots to cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds. When you do, you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

Here is a list of all domains from PHB, SCAG, XGE, & TCE (You are free to use other domains):

Arcana, [Death](compendium/classes/cleric-death-domain.md#Death%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Forge](compendium/classes/cleric-forge-domain-xge.md#Forge%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Grave](compendium/classes/cleric-grave-domain-xge.md#Grave%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Knowledge](compendium/classes/cleric-knowledge-domain.md#Knowledge%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Life](compendium/classes/cleric-life-domain.md#Life%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Light](compendium/classes/cleric-light-domain.md#Light%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Nature](compendium/classes/cleric-nature-domain.md#Nature%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Order](compendium/classes/cleric-order-domain-tce.md#Order%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Peace](compendium/classes/cleric-peace-domain-tce.md#Peace%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Tempest](compendium/classes/cleric-tempest-domain.md#Tempest%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Trickery](compendium/classes/cleric-trickery-domain.md#Trickery%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [Twilight](compendium/classes/cleric-twilight-domain-tce.md#Twilight%20Domain%20(Level%201)), [War](compendium/classes/cleric-war-domain.md#War%20Domain%20(Level%201))

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, which you gain from a temporary affiliation with a deity associated with the domain you choose. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<span class='abilityDc'>**Spell save DC**: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</span>

<span class='abilityAttackMod'>**Spell attack modifier**: your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</span>

^rogue-level-cantrips-known-spell-slots-slot-level

For the purposes of multiclassing, treat this spellcasting feature as if it were the same as a warlock's Pact Magic. You can use the spell slots you gain from other Spellcasting class features to cast any domain spells that you have Heretic spell slots for.

### Conversion (Level 9)

Starting at 9th level, your familiarity with religion and divinity has grown to serve you in new ways. You can change your chosen cleric domain to a different one using a bonus action. Once you do, you can not do so again until you finish a long rest.

You can also use your Evasion feature for any saving throw you make to prevent radiant damage, even if its not a Dexterity saving throw. Further, you can add your proficiency bonus to saving throws against the spells and special abilities of celestials.

### Blasphemous Senses (Level 13)

Beginning at 13th level, you can use an action to detect the presence of any aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you, provided you are not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Blinded\|blinded]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]]. You know the number and type of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity or exact location. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Heretic's Blessing (Level 17)

At 17th level, your Heretic's Curse can guide your allies' strikes. Whenever a friendly creature (including yourself ) attacks a target under the effects of your Heretic's Curse, that creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll.

In addition, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Commune.md\|commune]] spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. This version of the spell allows you to contact a deity aligned with your current chosen cleric domain, although it may not regard you with the same familiarity that it would a devout follower.
