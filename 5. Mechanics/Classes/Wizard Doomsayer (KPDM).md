## Class Features

### Doomsayer (Level 2)

The magic you seek is as powerful as it is destructive.

### Arcane Specialty (Level 2)

Any fool can learn to hurl a Fireball, but only a Master of the apocalypse can open a Black Hole. Some doomsayers use their terrible power to amass a conquering army; others seek to become a force of Darkness and to reshape the world according to their own vision.

### Apocalypse Savant (Level 2)

Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an apocalypse spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Wicked Presence (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to instill a sense of impending doom in creatures who witness your power. When you kill a creature with a spell that isn't a cantrip, you can use a bonus action to select one or more creatures within 30 feet of the creature you just killed. Each of those creatures must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, Ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Terrible Power (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, whenever you score a critical hit with a spell attack, choose one of the following two effects:

- Every creature affected by the spell must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of you until the end of its next turn.  
- Every creature affected by the spell must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.  

### Merciless Onslaught (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, you have advantage when making spell attack rolls against creatures that are frightened or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]].

### Power from Darkness (Level 14)

Beginning at 14th level, your spell attacks score critical hits when the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20.
