## Class Features

### Carillon Domain (Level 1)

Clerics that revere the meditative toll of bells are practitioners of the carillon domain. Typically bellringers, parishioners, or pilgrims, clerics of this domain are equally devoted to all places of worship and interpret deities through the temple bells that sing their praise. They understand the power that bells hold as holy creations responsible for decreeing time, warning the innocent, and mourning the loss of those who pass on. Through bells, these clerics can rally the good and condemn the wicked, all while wordlessly proclaiming their reverence of the divine. While no specific deities are likely to claim ownership of this domain, each is as likely as the next to empower these clerics with their blessing in exchange for their proselytizing and sounding of the bells in their name.

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with flails, mauls, morningstars, warhammers, and heavy armor.

### Blessing of the Bell (Level 1)

Also at 1st level, you can hear the ringing of divine bells throughout the day. You always know what time it is, up to the nearest quarter hour. The bells also ring to signify the beginning of battle, granting you a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +0).

### Channel Divinity: Frightful Knell (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, when a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to emit a foretelling death knell from it, using your Channel Divinity. The death knell is audible out to a range of 10 feet, and each creature of your choice that can hear it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] of the triggering target (or whatever is left of it) until the end of its next turn. A [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Incapacitated\|incapacitated]] for the duration as it contemplates its own mortality. Each time the creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

When you reach 17th level in this class, the death knells audible range increases to 30 feet.

### Holy Clangor (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to emit a faint, divine ringing that lasts for 1 minute, like a bell tolling noon. When you use this feature, a resonant wave emanates from you thats audible out to a range of 10 feet. The sound of the wave and its effect depends on the creature that hears it. A friendly creature that hears the sound (including yourself ) can immediately make a saving throw against one effect on it thats causing it to be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], as the wave rings with a divine clarity. A hostile creature that hears the sound takes an amount of psychic damage equal to your proficiency bonus, as it wails with a dreadful tone instead.

For the duration, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to send out the wave again. When you reach 17th level in this class, the waves audible range increases to 30 feet.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Unwavering Resonance (Level 17)

By 17th level, you are immune to thunder damage and can not be [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Deafened\|deafened]]. In addition, while your Holy Clangor is active, you have blindsight out to its audible range, and you automatically emit its divine wave when you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage for the first time since the start of your last turn.
