## Class Features

### Apocalypse Domain (Level 1)

Gods with the Apocalypse domain promote fear, judgment, punishment, and the end of all things.

#### Divine Domain Option
_Source: Deep Magic_

Their priesthoods often consider themselves the messengers of that doom, and they work to spread word of the coming end. Their gloomy, often frightening message makes them unwelcome in many, but not all, civilized places.

### Ranting Ruin (Level 1)

At 1st level, you learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Vicious Mockery.md\|vicious mockery]] cantrip. You also gain proficiency in either [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Survival\|Survival]] (your choice).

### Channel Divinity: Damnation (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to lash out at those who defy your deity's messenger. As an action, you present your [[5. Mechanics/Items/Holy Symbol.md\|holy symbol]] while pronouncing doom to unbelievers. Each hostile creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) + your Cleric level necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

### Channel Divinity: Weight of Guilt (Level 6)

At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to manipulate a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind as an advantage when interrogating it.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That  creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you automatically know for the next 10 minutes whether anything the target says is true, a lie, or in between. On a successful save, the target cannot be affected by this spell until you finish a long rest.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).

### Herald of the Apocalypse (Level 17)

At 17th level, you gain resistance to acid, fire, and poison damage.
