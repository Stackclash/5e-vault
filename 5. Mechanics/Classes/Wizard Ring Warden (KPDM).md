## Class Features

### Ring Warden (Level 2)

The Dwarves long ago discovered the means to infuse magic into rings, and the first ring wardens came into being soon after that discovery came to light.

### Wizard Specialty (Level 2)

With a focus on the school of transmutation, ring wardens blend dwarven craftsmanship with arcane might. They are rarely encountered outside dwarven nations, but they are easy to recognize thanks to their signature ring-staves.

Except as noted below, ring wardens function as [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard School Of Transmutation.md\|transmuters]] and use the wizard spell list.

### Transmutation Savant (Level 2)

Beginning when you select this specialty at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Ring Savant (Level 2)

In addition, the gold and time you must spend to copy a ring magic spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 2)

Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Smiths Tools.md\|blacksmith's tools]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Jewelers Tools.md\|jeweler's tools]].

### Bonded Ring-Staff (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you create a special [[5. Mechanics/Items/Quarterstaff.md\|quarterstaff]] with two special metal rings adorning it. When you roll damage for a spell attack while you hold your ring-staff, you can add your proficiency bonus to the result. If the spell allows for multiple damage rolls against multiple targets (such as with [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Scorching Ray.md\|scorching ray]]), you must choose which roll gains the benefit before you roll the die. You can use this ability a number of times equal to the number of rings on your staff. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Whenever you gain a new wizard level, you can attach a new ring to your staff by spending 8 hours of work with [[5. Mechanics/Items/Smiths Tools.md\|blacksmith's tools]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Jewelers Tools.md\|jeweler's tools]] and paying a cost of 5 gp in raw materials.

### Master Metalsmith (Level 6)

Beginning at 6th level, you can add twice your normal proficiency bonus when you use the tools you chose at 2nd level. When using your chosen tools to craft nonmagical or magical items, you make twice the normal amount of progress each day.

Additionally, you learn the method for crafting a single kind of magic ring chosen from the following list: [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Jumping.md\|ring of jumping]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Mind Shielding.md\|ring of mind shielding]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Protection.md\|ring of protection]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of The Ram.md\|ring of the ram]], [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Regeneration.md\|ring of regeneration]], or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Ring Of Resistance (DMG).md\|ring of resistance]]. At the GM's discretion, you can choose a ring not listed here. You must meet all the standard Prerequisites for crafting the ring and pay the required gold as normal, along with providing any Special materials or meeting any conditions set by the GM.

### Imbue Ring (Level 10)

Starting at 10th level, you can imbue magic into the special rings that decorate your ring-staff. When you cast a spell, instead of having it take effect normally, you can choose to store the spell in one of the rings. As long as the spell is stored, you can't regain the expended spell slot. You can remove an imbued ring from the staff and give it to another creature (or hold it yourself) as an action. A creature holding an imbued ring can release the stored spell as an action. Attack rolls, saving throws, and damage are based on the caster who imbued the ring, but the creature holding the ring counts as the spell's caster for all other purposes.

After you remove an imbued ring from the staff, you must create a new Special ring and affix it to the staff by working for 8 hours and spending 5 gp in raw materials. An imbued ring is considered a magical effect for the purpose of [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]]. You can have a number of rings imbued at one time equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Ring Bond (Level 14)

At 14th level or higher, with 1 hour of work (which can be accomplished during a short rest), you can embed a single magic ring that you possess into your ring-staff. The ring's rarity must be common, uncommon, or rare. As long as you hold the ring-staff, you gain the effect of the embedded ring as if you were attuned to it and wearing it (including any negative effects of attuning to the item, such as curses). This embedded ring doesn't count as one of your three allowable attuned magic items.

With one hour of work, you can remove an embedded ring (along with its attunement) and replace it with a new one if desired.
