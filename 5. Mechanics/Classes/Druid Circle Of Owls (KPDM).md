## Class Features

### Circle of Owls (Level 2)

Druids of the Circle of Owls maintain their tradition of spying and gathering knowledge and, occasionally, of permanently silencing those who would misuse knowledge. The Circle of Owls druids draw on the power of their namesakes, moving about the world unnoticed as they see and hear what others try desperately to hide.

These druids maintain closer relationships with the shadow fey than most. They find this relationship advantageous, though often tense, in their pursuit of secrets. Along with access to shadow fey agents and information, Circle of Owls druids regularly make bargains with strange owl-like creatures known as stryx. The stryx are natives of the Shadow Realm and find the Circle of Owls druids to their liking. Some stryx even serve Circle of Owls druids as familiars, at the GM's discretion.

### Circle Spells (Level 2)

The ever present eyes and ears of the natural world impart magical knowledge to you. At 2nd level, you learn the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Message.md\|message]] cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Owls Spells table.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 2)

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in either the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Deception\|Deception]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Stealth\|Stealth]] skill.

### On Silent Wings (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you learn to magically slip beneath the notice of even those who watch you. You can take the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Actions.md#Hide\|Hide]] action even when a creature can see you or when you have nothing to obscure you from the sight of a creature that can see you. You remain hidden in this way until the end of your next turn. If at that time you haven't found something to obscure you, you are no longer hidden.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Owl's Eyes (Level 6)

At 6th level, you can cast [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Clairvoyance.md\|clairvoyance]] once. When you cast the spell in this way, you don't require components, and the casting time is 1 action. You can choose for the invisible sensor to instead be visible as an owl.

Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Shadow Flight (Level 10)

At 10th level, you can slip partially into shadow for a short time. As an action, you can cast the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Etherealness.md\|etherealness]] spell. When you cast the spell in this way, its duration is concentration, up to 1 minute.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Parliament of Owls (Level 14)

When you reach 14th level, you can disperse your form into a great swirling storm of owls. As an action, you can use your Wild Shape to become a swarm of owls.
