# Dreamless Slumber
*Magical Trap*  

*Magic school: enchantment*

Sometimes capturing thieves is more important than permanently stopping them, and that was the impetus for creating the dreamless slumber trap, which layers an enchantment over a traditional needle trap on a chest or door. The trap is triggered by touching the chest or door. When that occurs, the creature takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall into a dreamless, ageless, magical stasis. The stasis remains until it is successfully removed by [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] (DC 17) or until three months have passed.

The trap can be detected with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check, and disarmed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]].
