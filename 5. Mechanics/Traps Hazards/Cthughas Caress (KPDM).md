# Cthugha's Caress
*Magical Trap*  

*Magic school: evocation*

The caress of Cthugha is patient, volatile, and the basis of a trap that [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|evokers]] find appealing. When this trap is triggered by stepping on a pressure plate, opaque smoke fills a 10-foot square for 2 rounds atop the plate, leaving a thin film of soot on everything within the square when it dissipates. On the following round, a flame fills the same 10-foot square and lasts for 2 rounds, dealing `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures covered in the soot have disadvantage on the saving throw.

A successful DC 14 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check identifies the soot as fire elemental residue. On a check that beats the DC by 4 or more, the character recalls that the substance is highly combustible. Removing the soot requires an action.

The pressure plate is detected with a successful DC 16 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check, and it can be disarmed with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Failing this check by 4 or more activates the trap.
