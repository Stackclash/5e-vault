# Falling into Water
*Wilderness Hazard*  

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its reaction to make a DC 15 Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.
