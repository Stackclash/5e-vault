# Avalanche
*Wilderness Hazard*  

A typical avalanche (or rockslide) is 300 feet wide, 150 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in the path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if they're close to its edge, but outrunning one is almost impossible.

When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures must roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative counts 10 and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet until it can travel no more. When an avalanche moves, any creature in its space moves along with it and falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone\|prone]], and the creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When an avalanche stops, the snow and other debris settle and bury creatures. A creature buried in this way is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]], and it has total cover. The creature gains 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] for every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action, breaking the surface and ending the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] conditions on itself with a successful DC 15 Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) check. A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again.

A creature that is not [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]] can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature. Once free, that creature is no longer [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] or [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] by the avalanche.
