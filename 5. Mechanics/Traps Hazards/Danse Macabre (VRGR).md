# Danse Macabre
*Generic Hazard*  

This [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Variant Rules/Haunted Traps (VRGR).md\|haunted trap]] affects a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on an ancient but pristine instrument. When a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant, mournful music. A round later, a phantom performer appears and begins playing the instrument for the next minute. While the performer plays, any creature that enters or starts its turn in the haunted trap's area must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or float 20 feet into the air and be affected by the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Ottos Irresistible Dance.md\|Otto's irresistible dance]]. There they are joined by illusory dancers as they dance for the remainder of the performer's song. As an action, a dancing creature can repeat the saving throw to end the effect on itself, whereupon it falls 20 feet and takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage. If a creature's saving throw to resist the trap or to stop dancing is successful, the creature is immune to the haunted trap for the next 24 hours.

While the phantom performer plays, any creature within the haunted trap's area can use an action to try to convince the performer to stop playing, doing so with a successful DC 14 Charisma ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) check. When the performer stops playing, all creatures affected by the haunted trap are freed from its effects and float to the ground safely.
