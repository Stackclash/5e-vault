# Desecrated Ground
*Wilderness Hazard*  

Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Evil And Good.md|detect evil and good]] spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A vial of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Holy Water Flask.md|holy water]] purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Hallow.md|hallow]] spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.
