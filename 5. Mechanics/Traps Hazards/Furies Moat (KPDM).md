# Furies' Moat
*Magical Trap*  

*Magic school: enchantment*

Wizards of the Northern tribes fight alongside their berserker brethren, intimately aware of the awful power, and strategic limitations, of a warrior in the thrall of mindless wrath. This trap is placed in a water-filled moat or ditch that is laced with enchantments to drive enemies into an incandescent, all-consuming rage.

The enchantment can be detected by a successful DC 14 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check. Swimming across the water to the other side of the moat without incident requires a successful DC 14 Strength ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Athletics\|Athletics]]) check. On a failed check, the creature is swept under, taking `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) cold damage, and it must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be filled with murderous anger that can be slaked only by attacking any creature within reach. While affected, a creature must use its action to attack the nearest other creature. An affected creature takes an additional `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) cold damage at the end of its turn, and can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
