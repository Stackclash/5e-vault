# Step Softly
*Magical Trap*  

*Magic school: evocation/illusion*

The dwarven inventor of the trap known as step softly believed that adventurers are their own worst enemy, and couldn't resist using their eagerness against them. A room is built with a false floor too flimsy to support any weight above a pit trap and temporarily braced with magic to give it additional strength.

When everyone in the party has entered the room, glyphs blaze into view, covering every inch of the floor, appearing to trap the occupants in their spots. A successful DC 10 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check reveals that the glyphs are used with evocation magic. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] spell dismisses the glyphs and the magic that supports the floor, causing everything on the false floor to fall into the pit beneath the room. A [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Detect Magic.md\|detect magic]] spell, coupled with a successful DC 18 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) check, reveals the glyphs glowing with illusion magic and a layer of evocation magic under them.
