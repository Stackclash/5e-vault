# Otherworldly Pipes
*Magical Trap*  

*Magic school: enchantment*

This auditory trap uses otherworldly piping to transform its listeners into addlepated imbeciles.

The trap's insidious nature allows it to be hidden inside a chest, behind a tapestry, or even within a bell or among rafters. The only outward sign of the trap is a series of skewed star-like symbols engraved into the trapped room, chest, or object. The functional components (a series of small silver pipes, like a pan pipe, and a small set of magically animated bellows) can be found with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation\|Investigation]]) check. Once they are found, a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Arcana\|Arcana]]) check identifies the trap and the correct method of disarming it: a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Dispel Magic.md\|dispel magic]] spell (DC 17), which deactivates it for 1 hour. Attempts to physically disarm the trap by tampering with the pipes or bellows trigger its music and effects immediately.

Touching a trapped chest or object, or the door of a trapped room, triggers the trap. When this occurs, each creature within 10 feet takes `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) psychic damage and must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma are decreased by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) each. A creature takes the same psychic damage each round it listens to the piping; plugging one's ears reduces the damage by half. The effect lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or is targeted by greater restoration or similar magic.
