# Diseases

## Crone's Disease
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 62, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 26_

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting "Crone's Disease." Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with crone's disease. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting crone's disease as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.

Upon contracting crone's disease, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell greater restoration may return the creature to their normal appearance.

## Gut Rot

While afflicted with gut rot, any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer `dice: 4|avg` (`4`) necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with gut rot, a violet fungus sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) days.

## Influence of Zuggtmoy

While infected in this way, the creature is charmed by you and can't be reinfected by these spores.

## Spores of Zuggtmoy
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 105_

While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a "spore servant" if it's a type of creature that can be "(see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual)".
