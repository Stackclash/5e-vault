# Diseases

## Blinding Sickness
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]].

> This disease can be inflicted with the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contagion.md\|contagion]] spell.

## Cackle Fever
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: "the shrieks."

Symptoms manifest `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] that can't be removed until the disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) psychic damage and becomes [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]] with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]] condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`). When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Variant Rules/Madness.md\|Madness]].

## Crone's Disease
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 62, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 26_

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting "Crone's Disease." Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with crone's disease. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting crone's disease as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.

Upon contracting crone's disease, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md\|greater restoration]] may return the creature to their normal appearance.

## Filth Fever
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

## Flesh Rot
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

## Gut Rot
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 129_

While afflicted with gut rot, any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer `dice: 4|avg` (`4`) necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with gut rot, a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Plant/Violet Fungus.md\|violet fungus]] sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) days.

## Influence of Zuggtmoy
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 105_

While infected in this way, the creature is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] by you and can't be reinfected by these spores.

## Mindfire
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Confusion.md\|confusion]] spell during combat.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Contagion.md\|contagion]] spell.

## Seizure
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

## Sewer Plague
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]], and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]].

On a successful save, the character's [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

## Sight Rot
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] until its sight is restored by magic such as [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Lesser Restoration.md\|lesser restoration]] or [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Heal.md\|heal]].

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Herbalism Kit.md\|herbalism kit]] can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

## Slimy Doom
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#stunned\|stunned]] until the end of its next turn.

## Spores of Zuggtmoy
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 105_

While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a "spore servant" if it's a type of creature that can be "(see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual)".

## The Gnawing Plague
_Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 153_

The Gnawing Plague, also known as "the Gnaws," is known in every corner of Richemulot.

### Transmission

The Gnaws is spread when a creature is bitten by a [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Rat.md\|rat]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Giant Rat.md\|giant rat]], [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Rats.md\|swarm of rats]], or [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Humanoid/Wererat.md\|wererat]] that carries the disease, or by coming into physical contact with an infected creature.

### Infection

Creatures exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become infected. The DC of this saving throw can increase depending on the severity of the plague's spread (see ""Cycle of the Plague"" below).

### Symptoms

It takes `dice: 1d2|avg` (`1d2`) days for the Gnawing Plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. The infected creature then gains 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]], regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice, and regains no hit points from finishing a long rest.

The plague's symptoms include buboes, fatigue, splotchy rashes, sweats, and shaking, particularly facial tremors. Locals liken these twitches to the sniffing of rats. Sufferers often have scraps of leather placed in their mouths to prevent their teeth from clattering, though they inevitably gnaw through these scraps.

### Recovery

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. On a successful save, the creature's [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] level decreases by 1. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#exhaustion\|exhaustion]] below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

### Immunity

All forms of rats and wererats are immune to the Gnawing Plague.
