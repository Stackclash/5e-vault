# New Proficiency: Harvesting Kit
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 145, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 67, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 107* 

This guide adds in the new tool: the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|harvesting kit]]. Players may have proficiency in this like any other tool, and it is highly advised for them to have it as it provides a valuable bonus when making the checks outlined in this book. In order to accommodate this additional tool, the following classes and backgrounds have been slightly altered to give them the option to gain proficiency in the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|Harvesting Kit]].

- [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Ranger.md\|Rangers]] may have proficiency with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|harvesting kit]] upon character creation (this skill is not gained in multiclassing)  
- [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Druid.md\|Druids]] may have the option to choose between proficiency in the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Herbalism Kit.md\|herbalism kit]] or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|harvesting kit]] upon character creation (this skill is not gained in multiclassing)  
- The [[5. Mechanics/Backgrounds/Hermit.md\|Hermit]] background may choose between the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Herbalism Kit.md\|herbalism kit]] and the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|harvesting kit]] as its starting tool proficiency and gains the appropriate kit as part of its starting equipment.  
- The [[5. Mechanics/Backgrounds/Outlander.md\|Outlander]] background may choose between a musical instrument or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|harvesting kit]] as its initial tool proficiency. They may also choose between a [[5. Mechanics/Items/Hunting Trap.md\|hunting trap]], and the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|harvesting kit]] in its initial starting equipment.
