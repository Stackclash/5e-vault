# Incorporating Artificers
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 108* 

If you have incorporated Artificers into your campaign, you may use the following rules changes to make them compatible with these books:

- Artificers may craft items that are listed with the [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Artificer (HHHVI).md\|artificer]] tag in their crafting requirements. Artificers that have chosen the [[5. Mechanics/Classes/Artificer Alchemist (TCE).md\|Alchemist]] subclass may also craft items that are listed with the [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Alchemist (HHHVI).md\|alchemist]] tag in their crafting requirements.  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|Harvesting kits]] count as artisan tools for the sake of learning tool proficiencies when the choosing this class as well as for the [The Right Tool for the Job](compendium/classes/artificer-tce.md#The%20Right%20Tool%20for%20the%20Job%20(Level%203)) feature.  
- Artificers may choose to have the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit (HHHVI).md\|harvesting kit]] in their starting equipment instead of the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Thieves Tools.md\|thieves' tools]] or [[5. Mechanics/Items/Dungeoneers Pack.md\|dungeoneer's pack]].
