# Optional Rule: Carcass Degradation
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 5, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 5, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 5* 

This guide mostly assumes that harvesting takes place on a freshly killed corpse and that little to no decomposition has yet occurred. However, in some cases, a player may desire to harvest a creature that has been dead for quite a while. In these cases, the DM may declare that certain body parts have already withered away and become un-harvestable or may decide to increase the DCs of all harvestable materials as if the creature had died a particularly violent death. If corpse decomposition is too advanced, it is entirely within the DM's right to deny harvesting the creature altogether.

As a quick guide, the following timeline may be observed to decide on decomposition levels:

- **1 hour after death.** The carcass' hide has ruptured from bloating and has become useless.  
- **1 day after death.** The carcass' blood has become too tainted to be useful, and soft tissues like the eyes have putrefied.  
- **3 days after death.** The carcass' internal organs have decomposed.  
- **7 days after death.** The carcass has undergone extensive purification and none of its soft tissue remains harvestable.  
- **Note.** Harder materials like bones, teeth, claws, and hair do not generally undergo decomposition and will remain usable indefinitely.
