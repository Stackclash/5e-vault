# Optional Rule: Identifying Herbs
*Source: Hamund's Herbalism Handbook p. 3* 

For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed under the standard rules that characters are always aware of the identity of the herb they have gathered, including its name, value, and effect. However, if the DM wishes to add a bit more complexity and challenge, they may wish to force players to identify herbs as well.

Under this optional rule, whenever a character forages a herb, they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Nature\|Nature]]) check in order to identify the herb they have just gathered. On a failure, a character is only aware that the herb is vaguely useful, but does not know its name, effects, or how to use it.

A character that has opted to pick a herb is assumed to know which herb they have picked.
