# Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 6, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 6, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 6* 

Harvesting some creatures are more dangerous than others. While most creatures are harmless once killed, others possess poisons, acids, and breath sacks that remain active even after the creature's death. Even worse is that a simple misplaced knife stroke or errant twitch of the hand can lead to these materials accidentally harming the harvester.

Under this optional rule, whenever a harvester rolls below the DC of a harvestable material that has a "Use" section that deals damage, the material is not just lost, it also expends its ability on the harvester. For example, a character that fails to properly harvest a poison would suffer the effect of that poison on themselves, or a character that fails to harvest a breath sack would release the effect of that breath sack in their direction. The exact adjudication of the failure result may change depending on the DM.
