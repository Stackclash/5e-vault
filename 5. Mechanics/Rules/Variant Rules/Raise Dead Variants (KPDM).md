# Raise Dead Variants
*Source: Deep Magic p. 350* 

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Dead.md\|Raise dead]] is another spell with roots in the earliest days of RPGs. The variants here are twisted, limited, or expanded in several ways. They all return a creature to life but in unexpected ways: as ghosts, for a short period, without memories or skills, or under a particular compulsion.

## Character and Effect Changes

Two aspects of [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Dead.md\|raise dead]] are easy to change: the raised creature's appearance and the traumatic effect of returning to life. The [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Raise Dead Random Effects (KPDM).md\|Raise Dead Random Effects]] table offers a dozen options for reskinning [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Raise Dead.md\|raise dead]] in random ways. When the spell is cast, roll a `dice:d12|noform|noparens|avg` (`d12`) or choose the option that best suits the situation or the caster. This change need not be a one-time thing; it can be emblematic of that caster, as recognizably personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a coat of arms.
