# Familiars
*Source: Monster Manual p. 347* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [[5. Mechanics\Spells\Find Familiar.md|find familiar]] spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Undead\Crawling Claw.md|crawling claw]], an [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Fiend\Imp.md|imp]], a [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Dragon\Pseudodragon.md|pseudodragon]], or a [[5. Mechanics\Bestiary\Fiend\Quasit.md|quasit]].
