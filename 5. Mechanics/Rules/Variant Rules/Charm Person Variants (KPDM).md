# Charm Person Variants
*Source: Deep Magic p. 349* 

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Charm Person.md\|Charm person]] is the classic enchantment, dating to the origins of the game in 1974. Its appeal is obvious: an enemy grants a bit of friendly head start to retreating foes, a recalcitrant informant suddenly becomes talkative, or a town guard agrees to ignore a crime because that's what friends do for each other. The five variant spells presented here all work on this theme but with differing levels of power and specificity.
