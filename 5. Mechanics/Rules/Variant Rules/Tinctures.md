# Tinctures
*Source: Hamund's Herbalism Handbook p. 39* 

While herbs are certainly valuable in the powers they impart, a major hindrance to their usability is the lengthy preparations that some of them require. In these situations, it may be wise to brew that herb into a tincture. A tincture is the essence of an herb, distilled through various processes and designed to apply all the effects of a herb in a much faster time frame.

## Using a tincture

Using a tincture takes an action and results in all the effects specified in the herb's description. Like herbs, a character may only benefit from the effects of one tincture or herb at a time. Using a new tincture while still under the effects of another tincture or herb, causes the first's effect to end immediately.

## Creating a tincture

Creating a tincture is no easy feat, and requires intricate knowledge alchemy to perform successfully. In order to create a tincture, a character must possess proficiency in and have access to alchemy supplies. In addition, that character must expend an amount of money equal to double the base cost of the herb to buy ingredients and other materials. Creating a tincture requires one work week of labour to produce.

At the end of the process, the herb is destroyed and the character creates a tincture with the name '`tincture of [consumed herb]`'.
