# Optional Rule: Herb Toxicity
*Source: Hamund's Herbalism Handbook p. 4* 

For balance reasons, it is advised to maintain the rule that allows a character to only benefit from the effects of one herb at a time. However, if the DM wishes, they may allow the high-reward usage of multiple herbs, by including a high-risk drawback known as **herb toxicity**.

Under this optional rule, whenever a creature is under the effects of one herb and attempts to use another on themselves, they must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 5 x the number of herbs they have attempted to use since their last long rest. On a success, they use the herb as normal. On a failure, their body rejects the overload of magical influences on themselves, causing the herb to be wasted, the beneficial effects of any herb currently affecting them to end immediately, and for the creature to become [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] for one hour.
