# Adamantine Weapons
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 78* 

Adamantine is an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft [[5. Mechanics/Items/Adamantine Armor.md\|adamantine armor]], the metal is also used for weapons.

Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an [[5. Mechanics/Items/Adamantine Weapon (XGE).md\|adamantine weapon]] or piece of [[5. Mechanics/Items/Adamantine Ammunition (XGE).md\|ammunition]] hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.
