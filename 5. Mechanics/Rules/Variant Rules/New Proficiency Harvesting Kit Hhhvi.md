*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 145, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 67, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 107* 

This guide adds in the new tool: the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]]. Players may have proficiency in this like any other tool, and it is highly advised for them to have it as it provides a valuable bonus when making the checks outlined in this book. In order to accommodate this additional tool, the following classes and backgrounds have been slightly altered to give them the option to gain proficiency in the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|Harvesting Kit]].

- Rangers may have proficiency with the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]] upon character creation (this skill is not gained in multiclassing)  
- Druids may have the option to choose between proficiency in the herbalism kit or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]] upon character creation (this skill is not gained in multiclassing)  
- The Hermit background may choose between the herbalism kit and the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]] as its starting tool proficiency and gains the appropriate kit as part of its starting equipment.  
- The Outlander background may choose between a musical instrument or the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]] as its initial tool proficiency. They may also choose between a hunting trap, and the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]] in its initial starting equipment.
