# Gemstone Dragon Psionics
*Source: Strongholds and Followers p. 196* 

The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.

The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into **manifestations**.

Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.

Over time, the dragon's crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. **At the end of its turns, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.**

Each dragon also has a **Fracture score**. Each time it takes more damage than its Fracture score in a single turn, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon's maximum charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.

## Manifestations

Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These **manifestations** are the primary source of a gemstone dragon's power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.

The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.

The save DC against a dragon's manifestation is 8 plus the dragon's proficiency bonus plus the dragon's Intelligence modifier.

## Auras

A dragon projects an aura 30 feet around it. The aura persists while the dragon has psionic charges remaining.

## Crystal Hide

Normal weapons bounce and spark off the crystals extruding from a gemstone dragon's skin. These dragons are resistant to damage from nonmagical slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing attacks.

## Sympathetic Vibrations

All gemstone dragons are vulnerable to psychic damage. The same crystalline structure that makes them hard to damage with normal weapons natively conducts any psionic radiation, causing its latticework to crack and shatter.

## Mindspeech

All gemstone dragons develop telepathy as they age. Most acquire it when they are young, but the topaz dragons are born with it.

## Matrix Mind

The gemstone dragons can maintain several persistent manifestations simultaneously but doing so requires expending 1 charge per manifestation at the start of each round. Damage disrupts psionic concentration just as it does a spell, but the saving throw is based on Intelligence rather than Constitution.
