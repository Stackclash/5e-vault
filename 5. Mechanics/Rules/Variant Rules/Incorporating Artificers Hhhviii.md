# Incorporating Artificers
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 108* 

If you have incorporated Artificers into your campaign, you may use the following rules changes to make them compatible with these books:

- Artificers may craft items that are listed with the [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Artificer Hhhvi.md\|artificer]] tag in their crafting requirements. Artificers that have chosen the Alchemist subclass may also craft items that are listed with the [[5. Mechanics/Optional Features/Alchemist Hhhvi.md\|alchemist]] tag in their crafting requirements.  
- [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|Harvesting kits]] count as artisan tools for the sake of learning tool proficiencies when the choosing this class as well as for the The Right Tool for the Job feature.  
- Artificers may choose to have the [[5. Mechanics/Items/Harvesting Kit Hhhvi.md\|harvesting kit]] in their starting equipment instead of the thieves' tools or dungeoneer's pack.
