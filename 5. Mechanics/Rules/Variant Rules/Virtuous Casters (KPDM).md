# Virtuous Casters
*Source: Deep Magic p. 173* 

Angelic spells are principally intended to be used by good-aligned spellcasters, though nothing prevents non-good casters from learning them. As an optional rule, the DM can declare that a non-good caster of angelic spells can gradually become more inclined toward a good alignment, provided that the caster uses such magic frequently for non-evil purposes.

The alignment of a spellcaster who satisfies that condition while advancing through two levels of experience moves from evil to neutral or from neutral to good (at the player's option, for a player character). After gaining an additional four levels, a caster who started out evil can move from neutral to good.

Angelic magic has no effect on the lawful or chaotic component of a caster's alignment.
