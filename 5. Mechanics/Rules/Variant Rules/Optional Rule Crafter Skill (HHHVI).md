# Optional Rule: Crafter Skill
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 113, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 49, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 76* 

Not all crafters are created equal. While a village blacksmith may be good at fixing scythes and making nails, if you hand them a dragon scale, the best you will get back is a ruined dragon scale and an apologetic look. If you have high quality materials, you're going to need a high quality crafter.

While under the base rules, anyone can craft anything so long as they meet the base proficiency requirements, under this optional rule, crafters are differentiated based on their proficiency bonus. A crafter may craft any item whose rarity is equal to or below their proficiency bonus as outlined in the [[5. Mechanics/Tables/Optional Rule Crafting Skill Proficiency (HHHVI).md\|Crafting Skill Proficiency]] table on the next page ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: below].
