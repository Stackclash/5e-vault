# Miscellaneous Harvesting
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 108* 

There may come a time when a character wants to harvest a creature for a material not listed in their harvesting table. Often this is due to them wanting some sort of trophy or keepsake from their kill. Due to the sheer scale of possible harvesting choices, it is impossible for this book to list every single body part that a character could theoretically harvest. Instead, you may use the following table for a general rule in deciding the DC for materials in a creature's body that are not included in their harvesting table. The DM is free to decide which of the following materials can be harvested from which creature, and if any special circumstances are present in that creature's anatomy that would change a material's DC.

Any materials harvested in this way have no inherent monetary value and are considered by general society to be mere junk. Although there may be an NPC willing to buy them from the player, this would be decided on a case by case basis and particular to that specific NPC's circumstances.
