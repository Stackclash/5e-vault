# Drunkenness Level
*Source: The Griffon's Saddlebag, Book 2 p. 274* 

Drinking alcohol is a common pastime and element of many social encounters. However, consuming too much alcohol causes a creature to become drunk. At the GM's discretion, this drunkenness can be measured in six levels using the following rules. A creature gains one level of drunkenness whenever it has a number of alcoholic drinks within 1 hour equal to 2 + half its Constitution modifier, rounded up (a minimum of 2 drinks per hour).

While a creature has at least one level of drunkenness, it gains a bonus to saving throws it makes against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]] equal to its level of drunkenness, and the DC required to intimidate it increases by the same amount. However, the creature also suffers a penalty to certain rolls equal to its drunkenness level. The kinds of rolls that suffer these penalties, as well as other effects of drunkenness, are shown in the table below.

**Drunkenness Level Table**

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Penalty to Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks |
| 2 | Penalty to Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as well as Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration |
| 3 | Penalty to ability checks that don't use Charisma |
| 4 | Penalty to attack rolls and Charisma checks |
| 5 | Speed halved, can't concentrate on spells |
| 6 | [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|Unconscious]], and can't remember the events of the last hour. |

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of drunkenness as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 drunkenness has a âˆ’2 penalty to Wisdom ([[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Insight\|Insight]] and [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Perception\|Perception]]) checks, Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. However, it also gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against being [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Frightened\|frightened]], and its DC to resist being intimidated increases by 2.

Certain creatures have a tolerance to alcohol that's either natural or practiced. A creature that has resistance to poison damage or has advantage on saving throws against poison must drink twice the amount of alcohol as normal to gain one level of drunkenness. A creature immune to poison damage or the [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Poisoned\|poisoned]] condition can't become drunk against their will. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, a creature may need to drink additional alcohol to gain levels of drunkenness as a result of building up a natural tolerance from drinking it frequently over time.

When a conscious creature starts its turn with level 6 drunkenness, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]]. On a success, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. When it does, the creature loses 1 level of drunkenness. The DC for this saving throw increases by 5 each time the creature repeats the save before it loses all of its levels of drunkenness.

For every hour the creature doesn't drink any alcohol, it loses one level of drunkenness, provided it's either [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] or has also ingested some food or water. Finishing a long rest removes any levels of drunkenness unless the creature fell [[/5. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#Unconscious\|unconscious]] for the duration of the rest as a result of suffering level 6 drunkenness. In that case, the creature loses `dice:1d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`d4`) + 2 levels of drunkenness instead and doesn't regain Hit Dice as a result of finishing a long rest.
