# Fireball Variants
*Source: Deep Magic p. 352* 

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|Fireball]] is perhaps the most iconic damage-dealing spell in fantasy RPGs, so why mess with it? Partly to add an interesting twist to something familiar, partly to give it a story or character spin, and partly just for fun. Here are three options to consider for source=KPDM used by your PC or NPC casters.

## Appearance and Type Changes

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|Fireball]] can be easily spiced up by changing its appearance and damage type. The following table offers twenty options for reskinning [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]]; roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) or choose the options that best suit the character who's casting the spell. The new appearance can become emblematic of that caster, as personal as a signature, a catchphrase, or a distinctive facial feature.

All items created by a variant appearance vanish as soon as their damage is done; no items or materials can be recovered.

## Power Changes

[[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|Fireball]] is an instantaneous spell, but it might just as easily resemble [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Heat Met(AL).md\|heat metal]], with a round of warning, a round of damage, and a round of additional damage. Spreading out the damage this way could be called a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Slow Burn Fireball (KPDM).md\|slow-burn fireball]]. Though this is a bit more bookkeeping, such a spell would be appropriate for limited use by a pyromaniacal spellcasting NPC.

While [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md\|fireball]] is an area of effect spell, a smaller version could attack a single target. This might be called [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Solitary Fireball (KPDM).md\|solitary fireball]], and could easily find a place in an elementalist's spellbook or in the hands of a fire [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Imp.md\|imp]] or an [[5. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Efreeti.md\|efreet]].

Finally, the third variant here is a [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bouncing Fireball (KPDM).md\|bouncing fireball]], which (as the name implies) strikes one location, then bounces according to the caster's direction to a second location and explodes again. This is similar to how [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chain Lightning.md\|chain lightning]] works, but [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Bouncing Fireball (KPDM).md\|bouncing fireball]] attacks multiple targets in both locations. The tradeoff is lower damage against each creature when compared to [[5. Mechanics/Spells/Chain Lightning.md\|chain lightning]].
