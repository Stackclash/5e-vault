This thick book is bound in dark leather, crisscrossed with inlaid silver lines suggesting a map or chart. When found, the book contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Arcane Gate.md|arcane gate]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Dimension Door.md|dimension door]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Gate.md|gate]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Misty Step.md|misty step]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md|plane shift]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Teleportation Circle.md|teleportation circle]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Word Of Recall.md|word of recall]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.  
- When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If your new position is out of range of the attack, it misses you.
