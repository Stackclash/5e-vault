You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[/6.

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4\|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20\|avg` (`d20`). On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
