This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/contingency.md\|contingency]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/fireball.md\|fireball]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/gust-of-wind.md\|gust of wind]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md\|Leomund's tiny hut]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/magic-missile.md\|magic missile]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/thunderwave.md\|thunderwave]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/wall-of-force.md\|wall of force]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3\|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.  
- When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice: 2d6\|avg` (`2d6`) force damage to the creature and knock the creature [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#prone\|prone]] if it is Large or smaller.
