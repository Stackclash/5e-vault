This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Contingency.md|contingency]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md|fireball]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Gust Of Wind.md|gust of wind]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Leomunds Tiny Hut.md|Leomund's tiny hut]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Magic Missile.md|magic missile]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Thunderwave.md|thunderwave]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Force.md|wall of force]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.  
- When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice: 2d6` (`2d6`) force damage to the creature and knock the creature [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#prone|prone]] if it is Large or smaller.
