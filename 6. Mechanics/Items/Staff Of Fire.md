# Staff of Fire
*Staff, major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Requires%20Attunement|Requires Attunement]], [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Cost**: ‚è§

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Burning Hands.md|burning hands]] (1 charge), [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Fireball.md|fireball]] (3 charges), or [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Fire.md|wall of fire]] (4 charges).

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
