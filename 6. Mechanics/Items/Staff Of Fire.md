# Staff of Fire
*Staff, major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement\|Requires Attunement]], [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/burning-hands.md\|burning hands]] (1 charge), [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/fireball.md\|fireball]] (3 charges), or [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/wall-of-fire.md\|wall of fire]] (4 charges).

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4\|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20\|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
