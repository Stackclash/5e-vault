# Wand of Scowls
*Wand, minor, common*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and target a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to scowl for 1 minute.

The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand transforms into a [[/6. Mechanics/Items/Wand Of Smiles (XGE).md|wand of smiles]].
