# Instrument of the Bards, Mac-Fuirmidh Cittern
*Instrument, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement\|Requires Attunement]]
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 2d4\|avg` (`2d4`) psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#charmed\|charmed]] on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/fly.md\|fly]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/invisibility.md\|invisibility]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/levitate.md\|levitate]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md\|protection from evil and good]].

In addition, the Mac-Fuirmidh cittern can be used to cast [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/barkskin.md\|barkskin]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/cure-wounds.md\|cure wounds]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/fog-cloud.md\|fog cloud]].
