# Instrument of the Bards, Anstruth Harp
*Instrument, major, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Item Properties.md#Requires%20Attunement|Requires Attunement]]
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 2d4` (`2d4`) psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#charmed|charmed]] on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Fly.md|fly]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Invisibility.md|invisibility]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Levitate.md|levitate]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Protection From Evil And Good.md|protection from evil and good]].

In addition, the Anstruth harp can be used to cast [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Control Weather.md|control weather]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Cure Wounds.md|cure wounds]] (5th level), and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Wall Of Thorns.md|wall of thorns]].
