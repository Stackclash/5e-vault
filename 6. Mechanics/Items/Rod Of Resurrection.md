# Rod of Resurrection
*Rod, major, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*  

- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement\|Requires Attunement]]
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/heal.md\|heal]] (expends 1 charge) or [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/resurrection.md\|resurrection]] (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a `dice: d20\|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of radiance.
