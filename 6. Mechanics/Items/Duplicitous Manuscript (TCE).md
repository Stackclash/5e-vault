To you, this book is a magical spellbook. To anyone else, the book appears to be a volume of verbose romance fiction. As an action, you can change the book's appearance and alter the plot of the romance.

When found, the book contains the following spells: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Hallucinatory Terrain.md|hallucinatory terrain]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Major Image.md|major image]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Mirror Image.md|mirror image]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Mislead.md|mislead]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Nystuls Magic Aura.md|Nystul's magic aura]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Phantasmal Force.md|phantasmal force]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Silent Image.md|silent image]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the illusion school.  
- When a creature you can see makes an Intelligence ([[6. Mechanics/Rules/Skills.md#Investigation|Investigation]]) check to discern the true nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the roll.
