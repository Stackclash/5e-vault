# Staff of Swarming Insects
*Staff, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement\|Requires Attunement]], [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Versatile\|Versatile]]
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff has 10 charges and regains `dice: 1d6 + 4\|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20\|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, a [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Insects.md\|swarm of insects]] consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.

## Spells

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/giant-insect.md\|giant insect]] (4 charges) or [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/insect-plague.md\|insect plague]] (5 charges).

## Insect Cloud

While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.
