# Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement\|Requires Attunement]]
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/detect-thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]] spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain [[6. Mechanics/Rules/status.md#concentration\|concentration]] on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/detect-thoughts.md\|detect thoughts]], you can use an action to cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/suggestion.md\|suggestion]] spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
