# Elemental Essence Shard
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*  

- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement\|Requires Attunement]]
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

Roll a `dice: d4\|avg` (`d4`) and consult the Elemental Essence Shards table to determine the shard's essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.
