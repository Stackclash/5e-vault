You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 2d10\|avg` (`2d10`) poison damage and become [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#poisoned\|poisoned]] for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
