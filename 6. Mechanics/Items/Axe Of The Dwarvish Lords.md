Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.

Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the _Brutal Pick_, the _Earthheart Forge_, the _Anvil of Songs_, and the _Shaping Hammer_. With them, he forged the _Axe of the Dwarvish Lords_.

Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.

Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.

## Magic Weapon

The _Axe of the Dwarvish Lords_ is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a [[/6. Mechanics/Items/Belt Of Dwarvenkind.md|belt of dwarvenkind]], a [[/6. Mechanics/Items/Dwarven Thrower.md|dwarven thrower]], and a sword of sharpness.

## Random Properties

The axe has the following randomly determined properties:

- 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties  
- 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties  
- 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties  

## Blessings of Moradin

If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:

- You have immunity to poison damage.  
- The range of your [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Senses.md#darkvision|darkvision]] increases by 60 feet.  
- You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.  

## Conjure Earth Elemental

If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Conjure Elemental.md|conjure elemental]] spell from it, summoning an [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Elemental/Earth Elemental.md|earth elemental]]. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

## Travel the Depths

You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Teleport.md|teleport]] spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.

## Curse

The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Greater Restoration.md|greater restoration]] or [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Remove Curse.md|remove curse]] spell.

## Destroying the Axe

The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the _Earthheart Forge_, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.
