# Crystal Ball of Telepathy
*Wondrous Item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [[6. Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement\|Requires Attunement]]
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This [[/6. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]] is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/scrying.md\|scrying]] spell (save DC 17) with it.

While [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/scrying.md\|scrying]] with the [[/6. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]], you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/suggestion.md\|suggestion]] spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/scrying.md\|scrying]] ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the [[/6. Mechanics/Items/Crystal Ball.md\|crystal ball]] can't be used again until the next dawn.
