While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Plane Shift.md|plane shift]] spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a `dice: d100` (`d100`). On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.
