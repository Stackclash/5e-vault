***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: `dice: 1d6 + 2|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`)) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [poisoned](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [paralyzed](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way.
