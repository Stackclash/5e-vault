The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its appearance is often taken as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth of a king. Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant elk when visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#prone).
