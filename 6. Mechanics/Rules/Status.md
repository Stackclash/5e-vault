## Concentration
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 203_

Some spells require you to maintain [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]] in order to keep their magic active. If you lose [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]], such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]], that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]] at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]]. The following factors can break [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]]:

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]] on a spell if you cast another spell that requires [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]]. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.  
- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]] on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]]. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.  
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]] on a spell if you are [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]] or if you die.  

The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Status.md#concentration\|concentration]] on a spell.
