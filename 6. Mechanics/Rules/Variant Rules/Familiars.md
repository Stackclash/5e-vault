*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 213* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Find Familiar.md|find familiar]] spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Cranium Rat (MPMM).md|cranium rat]], a [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Crawling Claw.md|crawling claw]], a [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Aberration/Gazer (MPMM).md|gazer]], an [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Fiend/Imp.md|imp]], a [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Pseudodragon.md|pseudodragon]], or a [[/6.
