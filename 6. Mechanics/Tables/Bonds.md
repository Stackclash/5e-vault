# Bonds


| Bonds |
|-------|
| I lost someone I care about, but I still see them in guilty visions, recurring dreams, or as a spirit. |
| I use my cunning mind to solve mysteries and find justice for those who've been wronged. |
| Someone I love has become a monster, murderer, or other threat. It's up to me to redeem them. |
| I owe much to my vanished mentor. I seek to continue their work even as I search to find them. |
| I desperately need to get back to someone or someplace, but I lost them in the Mists. |
| I deeply miss someone and am quick to adopt people who remind me of them. |
| The world has been convinced of a terrible lie. It's up to me to reveal the truth. |
| A great evil dwells within me. I will fight against it and the world's other evils for as long as I can. |
| Everything I do is in the service of a powerful master, one I must keep a secret from everyone. |
| I've seen great darkness, and I'm committed to being a light against itâ€”the light of all lights. |
| Spirits are drawn to me. I do all I can to help them find peace. |
| I'm desperately seeking a cure to an affliction or a curse, either for someone close to me for myself. |
