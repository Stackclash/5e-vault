# Personality Traits


| Personality Traits |
|--------------------|
| A signature piece of clothing or distinct weapon serves as an emblem of who I am. |
| I had an encounter that I believe gives me a special affinity with a supernatural creature or event. |
| I'm quick to jump to extreme solutions. Why risk a lesser option not working? |
| I never accept that I'm out of my depth. |
| I let people underestimate me, revealing my full competency only to those close to me. |
| I have morbid interests and a macabre aesthetic. |
| I must know the answer to every secret. No door remains unopened in my presence. |
| It doesn't matter if the whole world's against me. I'll always do what I think is right. |
| I have a personal ritual, mantra, or relaxation method I use to deal with stress. |
| I'm easily startled, but I'm not a coward. |
| Nothing is more important than life, and I never leave anyone in danger. |
| I compulsively seek to collect trophies of my travels and victories. |
