# Flaws


| Flaws |
|-------|
| I'm convinced something is after me, appearing in mirrors, dreams, and places where no one could. |
| I'm especially superstitious and live life seeking to avoid bad luck, wicked spirits, or the Mists. |
| I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows. |
| I know my future is written and that anything I do will lead to a prophesied end. |
| I know the ends always justify the means and am quick to make sacrifices to attain my goals. |
| I believe doom follows me and that anyone who gets close to me will face a tragic end. |
| I need to find the best in everyone and everything, even when that means denying obvious malice. |
| I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out. |
| I've seen the evil of a type of place—like forests, cities, or graveyards—and resist going there. |
| I am exceptionally credulous and believe any story or legend immediately. |
| I'm exceptionally cautious, planning laboriously and devising countless contingencies. |
| I'm a skeptic and don't believe in the power of rituals, religion, superstition, or spirits. |
