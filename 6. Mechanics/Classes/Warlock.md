## Class Features

### Pact Magic (Level 1)

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See "chapter 10" for the general rules of spellcasting and "chapter 11" for the warlock spell list.

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/witch-bolt.md\|witch bolt]], you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC**: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier**: your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

### Otherworldly Patron (Level 1)

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being chosen from the list of available patrons. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Eldritch Invocations (Level 2)

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. A list of the available options can be found on the Optional Features page. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

### Pact Boon (Level 3)

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

- [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md#Pact%20of%20the%20Chain\|Pact of the Chain]]  
- [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md#Pact%20of%20the%20Blade\|Pact of the Blade]]  
- [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md#Pact%20of%20the%20Tome\|Pact of the Tome]]  
- Pact of the Star Chain  
- Pact of the Talisman  
- [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md#Pact%20of%20the%20Talisman\|Pact of the Talisman]]  

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Eldritch Versatility (Level 4)
_Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 70_

_4th-level warlock optional class features_

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:

- Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.  
- Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.  
- If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.  

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 8)

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 12)

### Book of Ancient Secrets

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list. The spells needn't be from the same spell list. The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows.

This change doesn't extend the curse's duration.

When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional `dice: 2d8\|avg` (`2d8`) slashing damage to the target per spell level, and you can reduce the creature's speed to 0 feet until the end of your next turn.
