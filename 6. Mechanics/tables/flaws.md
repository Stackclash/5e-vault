# Flaws


| Flaws |
|-------|
| I can't keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else's. |
| I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong. |
| I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost many lives—and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret. |
| Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of a civilization. |
| I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless. |
| I'll do anything to win fame and renown. |
| I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble. |
| I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in. |
| I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more. |
| I'm a skeptic and don't believe in the power of rituals, religion, superstition, or spirits. |
| Most people scream and run when they see a demon. I stop and take notes on its anatomy. |
| I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them. |
| When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |
| Secretly, I believe that things would be better if I were a tyrant lording over the land. |
| I turn tail and run when things look bad. |
| Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends. |
| No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers. |
| I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat. |
| I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures. |
| I'd rather kill someone in their sleep than fight fair. |
| I obey the law, even if the law causes misery. |
| I would kill to acquire a noble title. |
|  Violence is my answer to almost any challenge. |
| The tyrant who rules my land will stop at nothing to see me killed. |
| I'm convinced something is after me, appearing in mirrors, dreams, and places where no one could. |
| I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows. |
| Gold seems like a lot of money to me, and I'll do just about anything for more of it. |
| I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough. |
| I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out. |
| I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying. |
| I am inflexible in my thinking. |
| In fact, the world does revolve around me. |
|  Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish. |
| I'm exceptionally cautious, planning laboriously and devising countless contingencies. |
| If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it. |
| My hatred of my enemies is blinding and unreasoning. |
| I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy. |
| My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god. |
| I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell. |
| I know my future is written and that anything I do will lead to a prophesied end. |
| I believe doom follows me and that anyone who gets close to me will face a tragic end. |
| I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work. |
| Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation. |
| I've seen the evil of a type of place—like forests, cities, or graveyards—and resist going there. |
| I'm convinced of the significance of my destiny, and blind to my shortcomings and the risk of failure. |
| I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across. |
| The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear. |
| I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge. |
| I can't resist a pretty face. |
| I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants. |
| I'm too greedy for my own good. I can't resist taking a risk if there's money involved. |
| I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulting others. |
| I like keeping secrets and won't share them with anyone. |
| I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me. |
| Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much. |
| I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever. |
| I'd rather eat my armor than admit when I'm wrong. |
| I'm especially superstitious and live life seeking to avoid bad luck, wicked spirits, or the Mists. |
| I have trouble trusting in my allies. |
| I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony. |
| I have a weakness for the vices of the city, especially hard drink. |
| I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies. |
| I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me. |
| I am exceptionally credulous and believe any story or legend immediately. |
| I'm convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others. |
| When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it. |
| My pride will probably lead to my destruction. |
| Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop. |
| If I'm outnumbered, I will run away from a fight. |
| I am easily distracted by the promise of information. |
| I overlook obvious solutions in favor of complicated ones. |
| I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me. |
| I need to find the best in everyone and everything, even when that means denying obvious malice. |
| An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that. |
| I'm horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals. |
| It's not stealing if I need it more than someone else. |
| I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. |
| I'm a sucker for a pretty face. |
| I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me. |
| I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy. |
| I know the ends always justify the means and am quick to make sacrifices to attain my goals. |
| The people who knew me when I was young know my shameful secret, so I can never go home again. |
| I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior. |
| I will never fully trust anyone other than myself. |
| A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around. |
| Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. |
| By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family. |
| I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I'm quick to anger. |
| People who can't take care of themselves get what they deserve. |
| There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest. |
