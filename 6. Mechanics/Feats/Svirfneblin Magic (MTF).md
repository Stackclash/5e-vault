***Prerequisites*** Gnome (Deep)

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/nondetection.md\|nondetection]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [blindness/deafness](/compendium/spells/blindness-deafness.md), [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/blur.md\|blur]], and [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/disguise-self.md\|disguise self]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
