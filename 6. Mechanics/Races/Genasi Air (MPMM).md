You know the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Shocking Grasp.md|shocking grasp]] cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[/6.

Mechanics/Spells/Levitate.md|levitate]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/Feather Fall.md|feather fall]] or [[/6.

You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
