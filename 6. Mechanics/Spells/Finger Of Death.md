# Finger of Death
*7th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes `dice: 7d8 + 30\|avg` (`7d8 + 30`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Undead/Zombie.md\|zombie]] that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.

**Classes**: [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Sorcerer.md\|Sorcerer]], [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock.md\|Warlock]], [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Wizard.md\|Wizard]]
