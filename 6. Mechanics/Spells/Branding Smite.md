# Branding Smite
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra `dice: 2d6` (`2d6`) radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible|invisible]], and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become [[6. Mechanics/Rules/Conditions.md#invisible|invisible]] until the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Artificer Battle Smith (TCE).md|Artificer (Battle Smith)]], [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Paladin.md|Paladin]], [[/6. Mechanics/Classes/Warlock The Hexblade (XGE).md|Warlock (The Hexblade)]]
