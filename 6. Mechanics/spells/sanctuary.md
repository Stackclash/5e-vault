# Sanctuary
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a small silver mirror
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a [fireball](/6. Mechanics/spells/fireball.md).

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/6. Mechanics/classes/cleric.md), [Monk (Way of the Open Hand)](/6. Mechanics/classes/monk-way-of-the-open-hand.md), [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](/6. Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-devotion.md), [Paladin (Oath of Redemption)](/6. Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-redemption-xge.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/6. Mechanics/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
