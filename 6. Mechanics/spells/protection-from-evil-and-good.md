# Protection from Evil and Good
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [charmed](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#frightened), or possessed by them. If the target is already [charmed](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#frightened), or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/6. Mechanics/classes/cleric.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/6. Mechanics/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](/6.
