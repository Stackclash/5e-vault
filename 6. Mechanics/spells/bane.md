# Bane
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a drop of blood
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a `dice: d4|avg` (`d4`) and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Bard](/6. Mechanics/classes/bard.md), [Cleric (Grave Domain)](/6. Mechanics/classes/cleric-grave-domain-xge.md), [Cleric](/6. Mechanics/classes/cleric.md), [Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)](/6. Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-vengeance.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/6. Mechanics/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
