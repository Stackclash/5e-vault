These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/6. Mechanics/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
