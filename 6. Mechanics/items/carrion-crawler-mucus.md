This poison must be harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) [carrion crawler](/6. Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/carrion-crawler.md). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/6.
