A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice: 1d12|avg` (`1d12`) poison damage and is [poisoned](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't [poisoned](/6. Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).
