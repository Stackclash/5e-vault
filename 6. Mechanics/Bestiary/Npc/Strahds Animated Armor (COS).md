# Strahd's Animated Armor
*Source: Curse of Strahd p. 227*  

The armor that Strahd wore into battle when he was alive lives on today as a headless, animated suit of plate armor. The armor is painted burgundy and adorned with golden angelic motifs.

## Thing of Evil

Strahd imbued his automaton with a sliver of his being, bequeathing unto his armor a malevolence not found in most animated objects. He also fortified his armor and placed a number of permanent spell effects on it to make the armor a better castle defender.

The armor understands Common but obeys only the commands of its master.

## Traits

***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The armor is [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/antimagic-field.md\|antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/dispel-magic.md\|dispel magic]], the armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#unconscious\|unconscious]] for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the armor remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The armor makes two melee attacks or uses Shocking Bolt twice.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+6` (+6 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 3\|avg` (`2d6 + 3`) slashing damage plus `dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`) lightning damage.

***Shocking Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit) (with advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal), range 60 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 3d6\|avg` (`3d6`) lightning damage.
