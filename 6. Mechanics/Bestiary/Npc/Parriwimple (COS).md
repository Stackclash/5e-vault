## Traits

***Brave.*** Parriwimple has advantage on saving throws against being [[compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened\|frightened]].

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when Parriwimple hits with it (included in the attack).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Parriwimple makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+7` (+7 to hit), reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 4\|avg` (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage, or 13 (`dice: 2d8 + 4\|avg` (`2d8 + 4`)) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Shield Bash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+7` (+7 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: `dice: 2d4 + 4\|avg` (`2d4 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone\|prone]].

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Parriwimple adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, Parriwimple must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
