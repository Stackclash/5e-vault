## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The frog can breathe air and water.

***Standing Leap.*** The frog's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 1d6 + 1\|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, and the target is [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#grappled\|grappled]] (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]], and the frog can't bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The frog makes one bite attack against a Small or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#blinded\|blinded]] and [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]], it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the frog, and it takes `dice: 2d4\|avg` (`2d4`) acid damage at the start of each of the frog's turns. The frog can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#prone\|prone]].
