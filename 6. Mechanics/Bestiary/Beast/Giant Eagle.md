# Giant Eagle
*Source: Monster Manual p. 324, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, The Wild Beyond the Witchlight*  

A giant eagle is a noble creature that speaks its own language and understands speech in the Common tongue. A mated pair of giant eagles typically has up to four eggs or young in their nest (treat the young as normal eagles).
