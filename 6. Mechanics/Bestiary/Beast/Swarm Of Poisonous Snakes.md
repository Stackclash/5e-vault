> [!quote] The Nature of Swarms
> 
> The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a [yuan-ti abomination](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination.md) might have [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Beast/Swarm Of Poisonous Snakes.md\|swarms of poisonous snakes]] slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny snake. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+6` (+6 to hit), reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: `dice: 2d6\|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage, or 3 (`dice: 1d6\|avg` (`1d6`)) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (`dice: 4d6\|avg` (`4d6`)) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
