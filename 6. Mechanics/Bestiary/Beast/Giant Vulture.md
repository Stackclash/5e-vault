# Giant Vulture
*Source: Monster Manual p. 329, Princes of the Apocalypse, Storm King's Thunder, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden, Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep*  

A giant vulture has advanced intelligence and a malevolent bent. Unlike its smaller kin, it will attack a wounded creature to hasten its end. Giant vultures have been known to haunt a thirsty, starving creature for days to enjoy its suffering.
