# Deathlock Wight
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 87, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 129*  

Deprived of much of its magic as a special punishment, a deathlock wight lingers between the warlock it was and the wretched existence of a wight.

## Deathlocks

The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasionâ€”at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul Undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron.

An powerful necromancer might also discover the wicked methods of creating a deathlock and then subjugate it, acting as the deathlock's patron.
