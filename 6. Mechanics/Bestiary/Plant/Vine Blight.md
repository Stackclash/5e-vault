## Traits

***False Appearance.*** While the blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a tangle of vines.

## Actions

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 2\|avg` (`2d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is [[compendium/rules/conditions.md#grappled\|grappled]] (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]], and the blight can't constrict another target.

***Entangling Plants (Recharge 5-6).*** Grasping roots and vines sprout in a 15-foot radius centered on the blight, withering away after 1 minute. For the duration, that area is difficult terrain for nonplant creatures. In addition, each creature of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or become [[compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained\|restrained]]. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature within reach on a success.
