# Illusionist Wizard
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 263, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 214*  

Illusionists twist light, sound, and even thought to create illusory effects. Some illusionists are delightful entertainers, while others are devilish tricksters.

## Wizards

Wizards pursue magical power through the study of arcane texts. Some travel the world searching for esoteric tomes while others train lesser wizards or collaborate with colleagues to create new spells.

## Bonus Actions

***Displacement (Recharge 5-6).*** The illusionist projects an illusion that makes the illusionist appear to be standing in a place a few inches from its actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the illusionist. The effect lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if the illusionist takes damage, if it is [[6. Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#incapacitated\|incapacitated]], or if its speed becomes 0.
