# Githyanki Supreme Commander
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 141, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 206*  

Supreme commanders lead armies, each one commanding ten kith'raks, who in turn lead the rest of their forces. Most supreme commanders ride [[/6. Mechanics/Bestiary/Dragon/Adult Red Dragon.md\|red dragons]] into battle.

## Githyanki

Githyanki descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of githzerai (also in this book). These tall, gaunt folk have potent psionic powers and dwell, for the most part, on the Astral Plane. Among the best-known githyanki are the bellicose followers of the Lich Queen Vlaakith. They terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into other planes to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the githyanki fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The githyanki casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**At will**: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/mage-hand.md\|mage hand]] (the hand is invisible)

**1/day each**: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/bigbys-hand.md\|Bigby's hand]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/mass-suggestion.md\|mass suggestion]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/plane-shift.md\|plane shift]], [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/telekinesis.md\|telekinesis]]

**3/day each**: [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/levitate.md\|levitate]] (self only), [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/nondetection.md\|nondetection]] (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The githyanki makes two Silver Greatsword attacks.

***Silver Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+12` (+12 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 7\|avg` (`2d6 + 7`) slashing damage plus `dice: 5d6\|avg` (`5d6`) psychic damage. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [[/6. Mechanics/Spells/astral-projection.md\|astral projection]] spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Astral Step.*** The githyanki teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The githyanki adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the githyanki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Legendary Actions

***Command Ally.*** The githyanki targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear the githyanki, the target can make one melee weapon attack using its reaction, if available, and has advantage on the attack roll.

***Attack (2 Actions).*** The githyanki makes one Silver Greatsword attack.
